She stands her ground. Above all, she is straight and means what she says … Truss is a winner not because she’s a slick salesperson but because she is authentic.”</p> <p><strong>Penny Mordaunt, trade minister who narrowly lost out to Truss on making it into the final two: </strong>“Seeing her over the last few weeks has made me want to help her, to help her win, to help build the team we need to win the country, and to give ourselves as a party and as a nation the pride and confidence we need to reach our full potential.”</p> <p><strong>Kwasi Kwarteng, business secretary: </strong>“We have a 70-year high in terms of tax take, that’s not something sustainable, and that’s something Boris Johnson was looking at. That’s something Liz will deliver.”</p> <p><strong>Nadhim Zahawi, chancellor: </strong>“We are in a national economic emergency, and we need more than words. We need delivery, and Liz will be the delivery prime minister.”</p> <p><strong>Sajid Javid, former health secretary and former chancellor:</strong> “Tax cuts now are essential. There are no risk-free options in government. However, in my view, not cutting taxes carries an even greater risk.”</p> <p><strong>Tom Tugendhat, MP and chair of the foreign affairs select committee who came </strong><strong>fifth in the leadership race: </strong>“She’s shown what I’m looking for in a leader. This isn’t an exam, it’s a test of values and of the approaches that can change our country, deliver for our people, and protect us from threats abroad.”</p> <p><strong>Simon Clarke, chief secretary to the Treasury:</strong> “This is an incredibly important job and people’s readiness for that job on day one is critical, that is one of the reasons why I’m supporting the foreign secretary – someone who’s tested in the highest office.”</p> <p><strong>Nadine Dorries, culture secretary:</strong> “The only candidate who can even begin to pick up the baton from Boris, who embodies empathy, kindness, integrity and loyalty – values that are essential in someone wanting to lead a great nation – is Liz Truss.”</p> <p><strong>Suella Braverman, attorney general:</strong> “On policy terms, I think she’s a strong guardian of Brexit promises … and importantly she will take a firm line on identity politics.”</p> <p><strong>James Cleverly, education secretary:</strong> “I’ve seen how she’s taken longstanding positions on China, on making the most of the fact we’ve left the EU.”</p> <p><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg, Brexit opportunities and government efficiencies minister:</strong> “She is as good a Brexiteer as I am. She consistently in cabinet opposed Rishi Sunak’s tax hikes and she has the character to be a leader.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rishi Sunak</h2> <p><strong>Dominic Raab, deputy prime minister and justice secretary: </strong>“Rishi’s values are true Conservative values – patriotism, family, service, aspiration and hard work. His story is a Conservative story. He wants to be PM so he can put those values into action.”</p> <p><strong>William Hague, former leader of the Tory party:</strong> “The best hope is a highly disciplined, rational individual, one who always does their upmost to understand. Such a person is a very rare find in British politics.”</p> <p><strong>George Eustice, environment secretary:</strong> “He has an intuitive consciousness of political risk and can think several moves ahead, but he remains decisive and does not allow himself to be driven back to the path of least resistance.”</p> <p><strong>Oliver Dowden, former Conservative party chairman:</strong> “The question for Conservatives is who is best placed to win us the next general election. Poll after poll is clear. It’s Rishi Sunak.”</p> <p><strong>Ben Houchen, Tory mayor of Tees Valley:</strong> “During his time in government, Rishi showed unwavering support for Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool. As chancellor, he played a huge role in the transformation of our region.</p> <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt, former foreign secretary:</strong> “Rishi is one of the most decent, straight people with the highest standards of integrity that I have ever met in British politics.”</p> <p><strong>Norman Lamont, ex-chancellor: </strong>“Thatcher often said dealing with the deficit comes even before reducing taxes. Deficits are just delayed taxation. Rishi has the skill, determination and ideas to get us through this difficult period into more prosperous times.”</p> <p><strong>Matt Hancock, former health secretary:</strong> “Just like he backed me to invest in vaccines in early 2020, Rishi Sunak has the plan to deliver for our NHS and clear the Covid backlogs.”</p> <h2>Undeclared</h2> <p>Though it has been unsubtly suggested that Boris Johnson is backing Truss, he has declined to formally endorse either candidate.</p> <p>Other senior Tories who have kept quiet include the home secretary, Priti Patel, (though her special adviser is working for Truss), Michael Gove (ousted from the cabinet for telling Johnson to quit when he tried to cling on so now keeping a low profile) and Kemi Badenoch (who ran for the leadership and came fourth in the MPs’ ballot).</p> <p>While some former party leaders have stuck their oar in, Theresa May, David Cameron and John Major have also kept quiet. And Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, as well as the leader of the Conservatives in Wales and Scotland, Andrew RT Davies and Douglas Ross, respectively, are undeclared.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/04/today-i-killed-my-very-first-bird-review-gangsters-life-pleasance-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T11:49:03Z","webTitle":"Today I Killed My Very First Bird review – a gangster’s life laid bare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/04/today-i-killed-my-very-first-bird-review-gangsters-life-pleasance-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/04/today-i-killed-my-very-first-bird-review-gangsters-life-pleasance-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Today I Killed My Very First Bird review – a gangster’s life laid bare","trailText":"In an atmospheric staging, with poetic dialogue, Jason Brownlee sketches the cruel twists of a violent and abusive London childhood","byline":"Mark Fisher","body":"<p>According to the villain played by Jason Brownlee, his first word was an expletive. Perhaps he is using poetic licence to fit his relentless rhyming scheme, but he offers enough evidence of a damaged childhood to suggest it could be true.</p> <p>Brownlee’s gangster is a child of violence, the son of an aggressive father and a kindly but drug-addicted mother. The suggestion is that he suffered levels of physical and sexual abuse that left him brutalised by the time he had reached his teens.

I then ordered the fusilli ai funghi with rocket salad, and the tiramisu semifreddo.</p> <p><strong>Suzy</strong> I had steak, medium rare; then Eton mess. Alix seemed friendly, open to the world, intelligent and forceful, as a woman should be. She didn’t seem to like the idea that people actually want to make a profit from business – if you tax them more, or make them pay a living wage, there’ll be no incentive for them to do business.</p> <p><strong>Alix</strong> She kept saying that taxing the wealthy and big business at higher rates won’t solve anything, whereas I think fat cats should be taxed. It was clear that we were diametrically opposed on pretty much everything.</p> <p><strong>Suzy</strong> I said that the proportion of people who are doing tax avoidance and using offshore accounts is not significant enough to make a difference to the economy.

My reasons for supporting it were political. We weren’t getting the benefits from being in that club, and David Cameron had tried to negotiate a better deal and couldn’t. It has made life slightly more complicated in certain respects, but you can’t ignore the effects of Covid.</p> <p><strong>Alix</strong> It’s ironic because Suzy was born in Russia and came to the UK, but is against eastern Europeans coming here to work because she believes they’re taking jobs away from young people.</p> <p><strong>Suzy</strong> I went to sixth form college in the UK, so didn’t come for work and wanted to go back home, but I got married and stayed. The country shouldn’t rely on cheap foreign labour.

Sinn Féin can pretend there was no alternative but they are condemned by the facts.”</p> <p>Kenny Donaldson, a spokesperson for the victims’ group South East Fermanagh Foundation, said perceived or real grievances never legitimised the murder of one neighbour by another.</p> <p>Colin Worton, who lost his brother Kenneth in a massacre of 10 Protestant workmen in 1976, said the IRA had ignored peaceful alternatives in its campaign for a united Ireland. “For 30 years the IRA was wedded to the bomb and the bullet, and Sinn Féin is still trying to justify it. I don’t think they’ll ever change,” he told the <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/you-think-my-brother-had-to-die-michelle-kingsmill-victims-anger-at-oneills-claim-there-was-no-alternative-to-ira-violence-41888420.html\">Belfast Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>The controversy is a setback to Sinn Féin’s efforts to distance itself from the Troubles, and broaden its electoral base, without renouncing the IRA. O’Neill’s reference to the IRA having “no alternative” was a fleeting comment in an otherwise conciliatory interview.</p> <p>“My narrative is a very different one to someone who’s perhaps lost a loved one at the hands of republicans,” she told the BBC. “But we need to be mature enough to be able to say that’s OK, we’ll have to agree to differ on that one, but let’s make sure that the conditions never exist again that we find ourselves in that scenario.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein\">Sinn Féin</a> emerged as the biggest party in May’s assembly election, positioning O’Neill as first minister if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/30/stormont-parties-dup-back-election-new-speaker-northern-ireland\">power sharing is restored</a> at Stormont.</p> <p>The wide-ranging interview about her life and influences touched on O’Neill’s experience as a single mother.

The chairman normally likes to wait during the transfer window, hoping for bargains, but he moved early this summer, getting the bulk of the incoming business done by the middle of July. One person was particularly delighted by that and, if Antonio Conte is happy, so is everybody else. The manager had wanted to hit the ground running during his first pre-season at the club, to build on the momentum generated by the surge to a Champions League finish last May and, with a host of new signings bedded in, there is the feeling of clarity and cohesion.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"60b2c06a-cc23-4599-b1db-cc0ca5037b29\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pmGJ-RLCakk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The previous summer seems a world away. That was when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/30/tottenham-appoint-nuno-espirito-santo-as-manager-on-two-year-deal\">Nuno Espírito Santo was appointed</a> as the manager – after a 72-day search, to an underwhelming reaction – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/02/harry-kane-fails-to-report-at-tottenham-training-ground-as-he-seeks-transfer-manchester-city\">Harry Kane wanted to leave</a>. Conte has transformed everything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/tottenham-confirm-antonio-conte-as-new-manager\">since taking over</a> from Nuno last November, forcing his will on Levy and the rest of the club. Another gamechanger has been the £150m capital increase that Levy oversaw from the majority shareholder, Enic, at the end of last season.</p> \n<p>The squad has quality – headlined by Kane and Son Heung-min – and impressive depth. Thomas Tuchel, the Chelsea manager, believes Spurs have “maybe the strongest team they have ever built”, and he could find his club’s third-place spot from last season under threat. What would be even better for Spurs would be to win a trophy; they have claimed only one during Levy’s 21-year stewardship.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/tottenham-hotspur/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>Everybody knows what Conte prizes in a squad – mentality, physical strength and fitness, plus a sprinkling of talent in the final third to make the difference. After two transfer windows and 28 league matches, he appears to have what he wants. Or, at least, be close to it – the Italian gives the impression he can never be truly satisfied. It was questionable last season whether he would make it this far, as he issued threats and got into world-class funks, but he bulldozed the club back into the Champions League and, at the start of pre-season, declared himself to be “totally involved in this project”. Everyone is behind him, not least the fans, and each of his players knows exactly what is required. History shows that Conte tends to depart sooner rather than later, having worn everyone out. Before he does, he usually wins.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00a3c53833086af181468ed3c68ffb245dc18ef3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00a3c53833086af181468ed3c68ffb245dc18ef3/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Conte addresses his players during a pre-season training session at Goyang Stadium in South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Conte addresses his players during a pre-season training session at Goyang Stadium in South Korea.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Yves Bissouma could be an outlier in Conte’s best XI – a rare player to stand below six foot, even if it is only by an inch or so, although it is not as if he lacks the power that is a prerequisite for the manager. Bissouma, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/17/tottenham-complete-25m-yves-bissouma-signing-from-brighton\">joined for an initial £25m</a> from Brighton, excels at recovering the ball, whether through tackles or interceptions. But what will quicken the pulses of the Spurs support and provide a new dimension in central midfield for Conte is his ability to run with it, breaking the lines and creating chances.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>Kane will carry England’s hopes and dreams but, in general, Conte might reflect that he is not hit too hard by the mid-season tournament. Eric Dier is not expected to travel with England while Clément Lenglet faces a fight to make the France squad. Watching from afar will be Colombia’s Davinson Sánchez, Mali’s Bissouma and Sweden’s Dejan Kulusevski, while English trio Djed Spence, Ryan Sessegnon and Oliver Skipp are outside Gareth Southgate’s plans, while Lucas Moura has not featured for Brazil since 2018.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-04:20:11/embed.html\" data-alt=\"d\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-04:20:11/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://experience.tottenhamhotspur.com/spurs-sky-walk.htm?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8uOWBhDXARIsAOxKJ2GTbYlvJi6X3xlYfEc3SDSu3NQDpQqsRHpRApPM8zVAFiSW7ZsVtiIaAhYVEALw_wcB\">The Dare Skywalk</a> at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is exclusively for adrenaline junkies.

Pizzorno wasn’t exactly Thom Yorke, pushing the band into wildly uncommercial directions and trusting the audience to follow, but thanks to his musical curiosity and willingness to stray from lad-rock’s desire lines, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kasabian\">Kasabian</a>’s catalogue has always had plenty of moments capable of raising an eyebrow. Meighan, on the other hand, provided the visceral connection with their fanbase – the simian frontman in the Liam Gallagher mould, the embodiment of the audience’s aspirations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1a597c00fdabde85af56b16ed59ff383ecbfbeca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a597c00fdabde85af56b16ed59ff383ecbfbeca/0_0_6000_6000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kasabian: The Alchemist’s Euphoria album cover.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kasabian: The Alchemist’s Euphoria album cover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, of course, Meighan had to go. In 2020, the day after his departure from Kasabian was announced, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/07/former-kasabian-frontman-tom-meighan-admits-assaulting-ex-fiancee\">he was convicted of assaulting his partner</a>, and in due course Pizzorno decided he was going to take centre stage. Now, bands can thrive when a replacement singer comes from within the ranks: Pink Floyd and Genesis seemed to do OK for themselves after the loss of Syd Barrett and Peter Gabriel respectively. Joy Division reconfigured into something just as spectacular, in the form of New Order, despite Bernard Sumner having neither the singing ability nor the lyrical acuity of Ian Curtis. But for every one of those there’s Doug Yule taking charge of the Velvet Underground and recording Squeeze, or the two albums the Doors made with Ray Manzarek and Robbie Krieger singing after the death of Jim Morrison, albums so non-canonical that I defy any but the most committed Doors obsessive to even name them.</p> <p>What would a Serge-fronted version of Kasabian sound like? Would he reprise the agreeably off-the-wall ventures of his solo project, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/02/serge-pizzorno-interview-kasabian-solo-album-the-slp\">the SLP</a>, on which he appeared unable to decide whether he wanted to be a rapper or a forger of grand prog concepts? Well, sort of. The seventh Kasabian album nods in those directions without stepping conclusively towards them, and offers up some of the bullish, uptempo rock that sets moshpits roiling. It is generally pretty good fun, too. Rocket Fuel rolls in like the Prodigy, Pizzorno declaiming over a Middle Eastern-style riff, with a bassy thud that hits in the chest, resolving into a soaring refrain. Chemicals has a terrific combination of melodic verse and urgent, arena-sized chorus. Alygatyr is Kasabian as you either know or despise them – mid-paced and brutish in its simplicity. It’s easy to forget how thrilling a rock band being unselfconsciously rockist can be, and Kasabian can be as unselfconsciously rockist as the best or worst of them.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C0v_59n0ZY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-C0v_59n0ZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Kasabian: Chemicals – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But the rockism doesn’t translate as hoary blues-rock riffs. Pizzorno has as much interest in texture as he does in instrumentation; in making things sound like something else – you’d swear the single Scriptvre opens with an orchestra of ships’ foghorns. In fact he’s so determined to follow every idea that you sometimes wish he’d have fewer of them. The Alchemist’s Euphoria is packed with good ideas, but often they seem shoehorned into songs, rather than part of organic wholes – something that seems increasingly common with digital technology allowing songs to be assembled rather than written in the guitar-and-a-notebook sense (and, perhaps, a reflection of how hip-hop and R&amp;B and their offshoots now pervade music). The songs that feel more conventional – Strictly Old Skool, for example – come as something of a relief as a result.</p> <p>As a singer, Pizzorno is adequate but unremarkable. His voice is pleasant enough, and it doesn’t feel out of place, but there’s nothing distinctive about it; none of Meighan’s come-and-have-a-go presence. And that presence is needed when you’re delivering lyrics such as: “Jet packs / Life in a simulator / Drip feed / Straight to the incubator.” Pay too much attention and the sense it’s just gibberish becomes overwhelming. They require some sort of attitude to transcend their meaninglessness, and Pizzorno can only really reach that when he’s rapping (on Scriptvre and Rocket Fuel, notably).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/17/kasabian-sacking-frontman-tom-meighan-alchemist-euphoria\">Kasabian on sacking their frontman: ‘It was like seeing your house burn down’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The album’s centrepiece is a problem, too: a three-piece suite of apparently “space-inspired tracks”, The Wall, TUE (the ultraview effect) and Stargazr. The first is a generic MOR phone-torch-waver, the third an electronic burble with a cursory verse, while the second spends its last couple of minutes doing the laziest thing a track supposedly about space can do – emulating the sound of early-70s Pink Floyd, right down to the Nick Mason-style rolls around the drum kit.</p> <p>If this feels like a lot of complaints, at least it’s because Pizzorno offers up so many things that it is very easy to find bits that don’t work. Uniquely among the songwriters associated with lad-rock, he refuses to stand still, between albums or even within them. The Alchemist’s Euphoria is rarely dull, and often hugely entertaining. But one still longs for Pizzorno to make the album that is as great as the breadth of his imagination suggests.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Alchemist’s Euphoria is released on 12 August.<em> </em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/04/food-energy-bills-rising","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T11:00:06Z","webTitle":"Rent strikes and bill boycotts are a great in principle - but I’d end up with no electricity and an eviction notice | James","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/food-energy-bills-rising","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/food-energy-bills-rising","fields":{"headline":"Rent strikes and bill boycotts in the UK are great in principle - but I’d end up with no electricity and an eviction notice","trailText":"I’m on a pre-pay energy meter in a rented flat so I could only dream of radical action.

Even though I work full-time, high food prices mean I sometimes still do need to use the food bank to feed myself and my children. I’m seeing a steady stream of new faces at the food bank, and I fear that as summer gives way to winter – when people have to choose between heating or eating – even more desperate people will file through its doors.</p> <p>At the moment though, it’s the heat that’s the problem. When we saw temperatures reach record-breaking highs in July, leading to scientists declaring the UK to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/18/uk-weather-heatwave-cold-country-adapt-heat-climate#:~:text=The%20UK%20is%20no%20longer,expected%20to%20become%20more%20common.\">no longer be “a cold country”</a>. Naturally, poor people like me will suffer the most from extreme temperatures. I rent in the private sector, where private landlords have almost carte blanche to mistreat tenants with impunity. Badgering them for improved insulation or retrofitted air conditioning could backfire in the shape of an eviction letter. And I can’t invest in my property because it’s not really my property.</p> <p>You’d think if the government was serious about fighting the climate crisis and reducing emissions, it would make vital energy-saving measures such as insulation mandatory and would dedicate military efficiency to building as many new zero-energy social homes as possible. Fat chance. It feels like the Tories’ whole raison d’etre is to keep people like me as poor as possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/07/british-gas-bailiffs-food-shop-bills-hunger\">I’m being threatened with a visit from the bailiffs over my gas bill.

Sales fell for the fifth month in a row, although the decrease was the smallest recorded this year.</p> <p>Large corporate fleets registered an 18.2% decline, to 50,014 vehicles, while sales to consumers held steady at 59,847.</p> <p>A global shortage of semiconductors, exacerbated by Covid lockdowns in important manufacturing and logistics centres in China, along with the disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, all restricted production of new cars.</p> <p>The SMMT said the first half of 2022 had been tougher than anticipated, and cut its full-year forecast for new car sales to 1.6m, down from 1.72m. This is equivalent to a 2.8% drop in sales compared with 2021, and would make 2022 the most challenging year for the industry in three decades. There have been about 2m fewer car registrations since the pandemic began, the equivalent to a whole year of sales.</p> <p>The SMMT has also lowered its sales forecast for next year to 1.89m, down from 2.02m. Demand for electric cars continues to grow, however, and plug-in cars are expected to reach a market share of 22.6% this year, rising to 27.8% next year.</p> <p>The lobby group expects global chip shortages to start to ease over the coming months, although it will take a while before supply returns to normal. Shortages are still likely to be a problem next year, but to a lesser extent.</p> <p>Chip manufacturers have been investing in additional production capacity in the face of shortages that have been far more severe than predicted. </p> <p>July was a tougher month for electric cars. Sales of battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs) across the UK grew 9.9% to 12,243, and accounted for 10.9% of overall car sales for the month. While this is the weakest monthly uplift in electric car sales since the pandemic, overall growth so far this year has reached 49.9%, equal to a 13.9% market share, illustrating the volatility in the supply chain.</p> <p>It was also a weaker month for hybrid electric vehicles, with registrations falling 6.7% to take 12.2% of the market. Plug-in hybrids were down 34%, reducing their market share to 5.8%.</p> <p>Ian Plummer, the commercial director at Auto Trader, said demand for new cars was a lot higher than the figures suggested, and that supply chain issues had “hidden” the true level.</p> <p>“The market problem is still one of supply as war in Ukraine and component shortages keep a lid on new vehicles despite a lengthy queue of would-be buyers,” Plummer said. “Retailers still have backlogs of orders stretching back many months which they can’t fulfil yet, despite the best efforts of manufacturers.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said worries over high fuel costs and the cost of living crisis were pushing drivers towards electric vehicles, particularly when it cost nearly £100 for a tank of petrol while charging an electric car at home cost a fifth of that.</p> <p>“With fuel prices as high as they are, EV owners are now saving £165 for every 1,000 miles they drive. The savings are such that demand for EVs is outpacing actual sales. Around one in four of all new cars viewed on our site are an electric vehicle, but they account for just one in seven of all new sales,” said Plummer.</p> <p>“Bridging that gap could unlock the mass market reach of EVs – but for that to happen, concerns over the cost of new EVs compared with traditional vehicles will need to be addressed, as well as the ability of the secondhand market to keep up with demand for more affordable used EVs.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/04/all-or-nothing-arsenal-review-mikel-arteta-is-like-a-supply-teacher-out-of-his-depth","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T10:26:35Z","webTitle":"All or Nothing: Arsenal review – Mikel Arteta is like a supply teacher out of his depth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/04/all-or-nothing-arsenal-review-mikel-arteta-is-like-a-supply-teacher-out-of-his-depth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/04/all-or-nothing-arsenal-review-mikel-arteta-is-like-a-supply-teacher-out-of-his-depth","fields":{"headline":"All or Nothing: Arsenal review – Mikel Arteta is like a supply teacher out of his depth","trailText":"This documentary shows the manager striving to inspire his team during a mediocre season. But now the Lionesses have shown us football’s true meaning, do we really care?","byline":"Stuart Jeffries","body":"<p>Only three games into the 2021-22 season and it’s already squeaky bum time for the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta. Arsenal have had their worst start to a Premier League season, losing to Man City, Chelsea and, there’s no easy way to say this, Brentford. An extraordinary £140m has been spent over the summer on new talent, but neither they nor anyone else in an Arsenal shirt has been capable of finding the proverbial onion bag. Faster than you can say Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Arsenal are in a relegation dogfight.</p> <p>Look, I know it’s hard to care about the minutiae of boring, boring Arsenal, especially in a week in which England’s women have shown underperforming men the true meaning of football. But work with me.</p> <p>One of the pleasures of All or Nothing: Arsenal (Amazon Prime Video) is to see Gooners, like a bunch of latter-day <a href=\"https://great-characters.fandom.com/wiki/George_Minafer\">George Amberson Minafers</a>, get their comeuppance. “Being an Arsenal fan now really sucks, let’s be honest,” says KSI, the YouTubing rapper. “There’s nothing really to cheer about.” Can I get a boo hoo?</p> <p>Time was, Arsenal had it all: they were undefeated in the 2003-4 season; they were fixtures in the money-spinning Champions League. Now, they struggle to get into the Europa League. It’s as if they were (no offence) Aston Villa or Everton, rather than capable of joining the globally successful sporting brands in All or Nothing’s TV super league.</p> <p>“It’s the worst Arsenal team I have ever seen in my life,” bleats one fan demanding Arteta’s head. Mate, you’re three games into a new season. It would have taken a heart of stone not to laugh. Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, issues a statement calling <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/rwandas-president-criticises-arsenal-after-premier-league-defeat-12381493\">on Arsenal not to accept mediocrity</a>. Why is Rwanda’s president getting involved? Because Rwanda are Arsenal’s shirt sponsors. “Visit Rwanda” say the shirts, a slogan that, thanks to Priti Patel, now has a very different resonance. Football: it doesn’t have to make sense.</p> <p>Happily, Arsenal’s next home game is against Norwich City. How hard can it be, I wonder, to beat a team nicknamed the Canaries? (Just one reason why I’ve never run a Premier League team.)</p> <p>Cut to Arteta in the pre-match changing room trying to rouse the troops like Henry V at Agincourt. Some managers use the “hairdryer” (Alex Ferguson). Others kick things (Neil Warnock). And at least one (Leyton Orient’s John Sitton) offered out underperforming players. Arteta doesn’t roll that way, but instead goes for a pep talk that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/jul/27/i-had-fear-mikel-arteta-pre-match-team-talk-new-all-or-nothing-arsenal-clip\">manages to be both touching and baffling</a>.</p> <p>First, he tells the players that, when he was a child, he had Spain’s first open-heart surgery. The lesson he draws from this is that there is a parallel between high-performance teams and the team of medics who saved his life – both are motivated by love of what they do. Bukayo Saka and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, understandably, look blank, as if they are wondering: are we supposed to be heart surgeons in this analogy? Because, honestly, that seems a bit of a stretch.</p> <p>Then Arteta draws a graph on the white board to show his emotional status after the 5-0 trouncing by Man City. He places a dot far below the X axis. “That was me,” he says. “Dead. I had fears. I had insecurity. I had the media that is killing me.” It would be unfair (though not absurd) to suggest that Alexandre Lacazette’s expression says: “Oh dear. The poor old chap’s lost it.” Granit Xhaka is, I feel sure, troubled by questions such as: what does the X axis represent? And what unit of measurement are you using to plot emotional status on the Y axis?</p> <p>But, just when you think that Arteta, like some supply teacher out of his depth, is losing the crowd, he does something sweet. He places another dot above the X axis and does some decorative twiddles around it. That is his emotional status now. You see, he says, he has been cheered up in the past week by his players’ solidarity and defiance despite a string of defeats. What could have been the end of his Arsenal tenure has become, he says, “the best week of my football career … I want to say to you guys: ‘Thank you’.”</p> <p>Then Arteta adds words to show he is more Gareth Southgate than José Mourinho. As all bosses should be. “The last thing I want to do is to blame you in difficult moments. My responsibility. I take the shit.” How could they not beat Norwich after such a pep talk?</p> <p>Perhaps that sweetness explains why, even a year on, Arsenal have kept the faith with Arteta. Even though that profligate summer of spending yielded more misfires than hits, Lacazette and Aubameyang have gone and I wouldn’t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/25/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-1-arsenal\">bet on them beating Palace on Friday</a>. Arsenal are becoming as mediocre as Rwanda’s president feared. Not all or nothing, but something in between.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/04/the-kansas-victory-shows-that-democrats-can-fight-for-abortion-rights-and-win","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T10:25:05Z","webTitle":"The Kansas victory shows that Democrats can fight for abortion rights and win | Moira Donegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/the-kansas-victory-shows-that-democrats-can-fight-for-abortion-rights-and-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/the-kansas-victory-shows-that-democrats-can-fight-for-abortion-rights-and-win","fields":{"headline":"The Kansas victory shows that Democrats can fight for abortion rights and win","trailText":"Even in conservative Kansas, abortion rights are popular.

With an unexpectedly large turnout and a huge margin, Kansas voters on Tuesday rejected a measure that would have removed the right to an abortion from their state’s constitution. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/us/elections/results-kansas-abortion-amendment.html\">60% of voters</a> in the deeply conservative state rejected the anti-abortion measure.

The bill was designed to amend the state’s constitution in response to a 2019 ruling by the state supreme court, which found that abortion was protected in the state charter’s guarantee of “equal and inalienable rights” to all citizens. In contrast to the US supreme court, the Kansas court rejected the idea that civil rights were frozen in time at the time of the document’s ratification; instead, they extended those equal rights to women. “We are now asked: is this declaration of rights more than an idealized aspiration?” the court wrote. “And, if so, do the substantive rights include a woman’s right to make decisions about her body, including the decision whether to continue her pregnancy? We answer these questions, ‘Yes.’” Overwhelmingly, by a margin of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/us/elections/results-kansas-abortion-amendment.html\">roughly 20 points</a>, Kansan voters agreed with them.</p> <p>It was the first electoral test of support for abortion rights since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June, and the results were unambiguous. Even in conservative Kansas, abortion rights are popular with most Americans. Even in conservative Kansas, abortion bans are offensive to them.</p> <p>On paper, this shouldn’t have been surprising. Americans have a wide range of opinions on abortion, but broadly, the notion that women and others should have a legal right to end their pregnancy is very popular, capturing somewhere between 60% and 70% support. Accordingly, ballot initiatives asking voters to restrict abortion <a href=\"https://twitter.com/irin/status/1554638177767489536?cxt=HHwWgIC8wfLLl5MrAAAA\">tend to fail</a>, according to New York Magazine correspondent Irin Carmon. A measure that would have granted <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2011/11/08/142159280/mississippi-voters-reject-personhood-amendment\">personhood rights</a> to fetuses and embryos failed in very conservative Mississippi in 2011. A municipal ballot measure that aimed to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/11/albuquerque-voters-soundly-reject-20-week-abortion-ban/355327/\">ban abortions after 20 weeks</a> in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, failed by a large margin in an unusually high-turnout election in 2013. When South Dakota <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2006/11/08/sdabortion\">passed an abortion ban in 2006</a>, pro-choice advocates managed to collect enough signatures to put the measure to a popular vote. The electorate threw that out, too.</p> <p>The US supreme court’s ruling overturning Roe v Wade is particularly unpopular with the public, and has incited renewed passion for the pro-choice cause. According to polling from CNN, 63% of Americans – almost two-thirds – say they disapprove of the court’s ruling. A little more than half of them, 51%, say they disapprove “strongly”. This public outrage is clearly translating into votes. After the court reversed Roe on 24 June, many states saw a surge in new voter registrations. In Kansas, 70% of those new voters <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/03/kansas-abortion-vote-democrats-opportunity/\">were women</a>.</p> <p>There were some indications that the anti-abortion side was nervous, even before their resounding defeat on election day. They played dirty. The vote was scheduled for a blindingly hot primary day in August, when turnouts are usually low and Republicans fare better. In the days before the election, a Republican-aligned firm in Nevada <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/02/kansas-abortion-texts/\">sent out texts to Kansas voters</a>. “Women in Kansas are losing their choice on reproductive rights,” the texts read. “Voting YES on the Amendment will give women a choice. Vote YES to protect women’s health.” A yes vote on the constitutional amendment would have been a vote against abortion rights. Clearly, the anti-choice Republicans didn’t think they could win on the merits. Turns out, they couldn’t.</p> <p>But you would never know how resoundingly popular abortion rights are from the behavior of the Democrats, who for the past three decades, and since the election of Donald Trump specifically, have been allergic to full-throated defenses of reproductive rights and other so-called “culture war” issues.</p> <p>The party’s centrist leadership has made the calculation that only economic issues – defined, in practice, as issues that affect white men – can garner voters’ enthusiasm. The Biden administration was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/10/biden-executive-order-abortion-white-house\">flat-footed and inept</a> in its response to Dobbs, agreeing to take only the flimsiest and most risk-averse steps to restore abortion access and alienating huge swaths of its base as it attempted to keep the focus on its efforts to curb inflation. Biden hardly ever even says “abortion”. You get the sense he would much rather not be talking about it at all.</p> <p>But the results in Kansas suggest that he should be. The ballot initiative on abortion produced a massive turnout. Abortion rights got considerably more electoral support than Joe Biden did in most Kansas counties. It’s a so-called “culture war” issue that brought voters out in droves to vote for a Democratic agenda item. The Kansas vote shows that the overturning of Roe has created a moral emergency that voters will respond to. Ignoring these “culture war” issues does not make the Democrats look sensible and moderate. It makes them look like cowards, running away from a fight.</p> <p>What Republicans want to do to America, especially with regard to abortion rights, is unpopular. More importantly, it is anti-democratic and immoral. This is a fight that the voters want to take on. It’s time for the Democratic party to join them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/04/justice-department-must-indict-and-convict-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T10:22:05Z","webTitle":"Time is running out.

On 26 July, the Washington Post broke news that the justice department’s investigation is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/07/26/trump-justice-investigation-january-6/\">focused on</a> Donald Trump himself. Time is of the essence in bringing his case to indictment.</p> <p>Indeed, a moving target who gives every indication that he plans to strike again must trigger a different cost-benefit calculus in the inevitable debates both within and outside the justice department about when enough proof has been gathered to indict responsibly – and when it would be a dereliction of duty to delay further.</p> <p>The former president’s insistence that he has nothing to be remorseful about (other than <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/politics/trump-jan-6-riot-regret/index.html\">not marching</a> to the Capitol) makes that debate seem academic. And the steps being taken at his behest even now in battleground states to replace 2020’s failure with 2024’s success redouble the urgency. Shakespeare’s Brutus had it right when he <a href=\"https://interestingliterature.com/2021/08/brutus-there-is-a-tide-in-the-affairs-of-men-speech-summary-analysis/\">said</a>, in Julius Caesar: “We must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.”</p> <p>In these circumstances, prudence counsels running the clock backwards to set clear benchmarks for moving forward. Any calculation of how to proceed must start with two pessimistic premises. First, that Trump will run in 2024 and could win. Second, that if any of the likely Republican nominees wins, the next administration will be one that is eager to scrap any prosecution of the last.</p> <p>Hence, the goal must be to secure a conviction before November 2024, and in any event, no later than 20 January 2025, when the next presidential term begins. It is already too late for all appeals from any such conviction to be exhausted by that date, but the key to holding the chief conspirator accountable is a jury verdict of guilt.</p> <p>Consider this: the trial of insurrectionist Guy Reffitt occurred <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/defendants/reffitt-guy-wesley#:~:text=Case%20Status%3A,Indicted%201%2F27%2F21.\">13 months</a> after his original indictment. That trial, and its delaying pre-trial motions, were incalculably less complex than Trump’s would be. One can easily anticipate motions that, if denied, might go far up the appellate chain.</p> <p>It is not hard to imagine a majority of supreme court justices in no great hurry to resolve motions upon which the start of trial could depend. One can easily conceive a 20-month or longer period with the former president indicted but not yet tried. If Trump is not formally charged until January 2023, that would imply a multi-month trial starting in September or October. Should he run for president and win in November, we would have a president-elect in the middle of a criminal trial.</p> <p>Part of why a lengthy post-indictment/pre-verdict period is foreseeable is that federal district courts are bound to protect an accused’s rights to full airing of pre-trial claims and the time needed to file and argue them. Trump will have many pre-trial claims, setting out his serial and inexhaustible list of grievances, the imagined violation of his rights, his purported immunity from prosecution as a former president and the overriding unfairness of it all.</p> <p>Some district court judges more than others will balance protections for the accused with accountability’s pragmatic need for speed. Importantly, even the four Trump-appointed district court judges in DC have often shown little sympathy for those charged with perpetrating the events of January 6 or resisting their investigation. On 1 August, Judge Dabney Friedrich <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/08/01/reffitt-sentence-jan6/\">sentenced</a> Reffitt to more than seven years in prison, the longest sentence to date.</p> <p>Judge Tim Kelly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/12/29/1068703011/judge-refuses-to-dismiss-indictment-against-alleged-proud-boys-leaders\">refused to dismiss </a>indictments against Proud Boy leaders who were part of the January 6 siege. Judge Carl Nichols brooked no nonsense in Steve Bannon’s July trial, deliberately preventing it from becoming the “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/08/judge-tosses-jan-6-obstruction-charge/\">political circus</a>” Bannon sought to make it.</p> <p>On the other hand, among eight judges who have considered defendants’ motions to dismiss federal charges of <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512\">obstructing an official government proceeding</a> – Congress’s January 6 election certification session – Nichols was the lone outlier who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/08/judge-tosses-jan-6-obstruction-charge/\">dismissed</a> the count. That is one of the main charges that observers believe federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/03/understanding-criminal-allegation-jan-6-committee-is-constructing-against-trump/\">could bring </a>against Trump.</p> <p>The point is that if Trump were to be indicted, the Department of Justice cannot count on a favorable judge putting it on a jet stream to an actual trial. So what does that mean for precisely when Trump must be formally indicted?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With all stops pulled, prosecutors still have time to do what is needed before year end</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thankfully, it doesn’t imply the impossible. The Department of Justice could pull an experienced prosecutor or two from every US attorney’s office and put them together on the case.</p> <p>With all stops pulled, prosecutors still have time to do what is needed before year end. The tasks include talking to witnesses that the January 6 House committee interviewed and deposed, which is well under way. Cassidy Hutchinson, principal aide to Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows, and Vice-President Mike Pence’s top aides, Marc Short and Greg Jacobs, are now <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/cassidy-hutchinson-cooperating-doj-probe-2020-election/index.html\">working with</a> the Department of Justice or <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/pence-chief-staff-appeared-grand-jury-probing-jan/story?id=87384833\">appearing</a> before its grand jury.</p> <p>Cooperation is already <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/politics/klukowski-justice/index.html\">reported</a> to have begun among the lawyer-enablers of Trump’s coup plotting. With the investigation’s accelerating aim at Trump, every potential target’s defense counsel has surely discussed with the target the advantages of an early offer to plead guilty and cooperate. Early birds get better worms.</p> <p>On 2 August, the federal grand jury investigating the lead-up to the January 6 insurrection <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/pat-cipollone-subpoena.html\">subpoenaed</a> the former White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Department of Justice prosecutors are <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/politics/doj-court-trump-january-6-executive-privilege/index.html\">reported</a> to be preparing to go to court to secure his testimony about his conversations with Trump if Cipollone again declines to disclose them on grounds of executive privilege.</p> <p>The task ahead is massive, but if attacked with supreme urgency, it can get done. The building blocks for a trial of Donald Trump must be put into place with alacrity. In no case more than this one, the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good.

He spoke to 100 people from across the UK by phone, online, or while hitchhiking. Like the men and women sporting cardboard confessions in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/mar/04/gillian-wearing-signs-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Gillian Wearing photograph</a>, they told him secrets. They dug up half-forgotten memories, revealed hopes and dreams. He filleted those testimonies for vivid details, and juxtaposed them to hint at strange echoes and shared frequencies. Each is presented anonymously – no headings, no timestamps, no coordinates. In this way a nation’s psyche comes to the surface. The Passengers is not just an oral history of the contemporary moment but, drenched in mood and texture, renders the country itself as a sonic collage.</p> <p>Politics, at least the Westminster version of it, is barely mentioned. (An exception is the interviewee who mentions being bought a Priti Patel doll as a <a href=\"https://www.lovemyhound.com/products/pet-hates-priti-patel-dog-toy\" title=\"\">dog chew</a>.) But long memories often inform social critiques – not least in the case of the respondent who observes that many of his friends were imprisoned in the early 1990s for possessing weed. “‘Oh, we think we smelt marijuana on you.’ There’s Black men in jail, and there’s dispensaries and CBD oil and lip balms and hair treatments made out of hemp.” The language of someone who seems to be a traumatised immigrant is gaspy, fragmented, as if from a Samuel Beckett play – “I cried, too much cry. Yeah. Dream, dream. And then, wake up, I see my cry. Oh, too much.”</p> <p>Many of the conversations took place during the pandemic. Perhaps they were meant to serve as distractions from the longueurs of lockdown? In practice, a single mother bemoans the challenges of home-schooling her son and of getting him an appointment for a special educational needs diagnosis. Another, suffering from endometriosis, has had her bladder-removal operation cancelled and, desperate to start a family, is in a state of limbo. Another still, admitting her obsessive-compulsive mother never liked her very much, sighs: “I wish so much that the pandemic has not exacerbated her utter fear of being infected by the world.”</p> <p>Crescendo, diminuendo: the book’s earliest and final sections are short, sometimes they’re just a sentence or paragraph long. The middle sections are the longest and, perhaps like middle age itself, sad and self-flagellating. A thirtysomething woman thinks, at her age, she should be “technically an adult. But I am a child. I like nicer wine now but I’m still a fucking baby.” Depression struck a man in his late 20s and now he feels stuck in a box – “Not even a box, a raft, just going with the current of life.” A Tony Hancock-soundalike announces: “I’ve got a migraine which I’ve had for five and a half years now.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It would be wrong to suggest The Passengers is merely a chronicle of collective downturn and drifting. There’s a chap who exults in the decades he’s spent making wooden jigsaws, a blacksmith who rescued the horns of his grandfather’s bull (name: Mozart) and strapped them to the front of his car, a coach driver who enthuses about taking a school party to Crocodiles of the World (“Full of crocodiles, really! Fifteen species of crocodile, yeah”). An interviewee who managed to swallow a nail while putting up a shelf likes the idea of it “having a nice journey on the inside of me” and “fantasised about fishing it out and saving it, cos it’s like, <em>You’ve been through me</em>.”</p> <p>The Passengers can be read in any order or in one big swig. Prefaced by an epigraph from the film-maker Agnès Varda – “Chance has always been my best assistant” – it doesn’t try to present a unified theory of Britain today. (Although surely few readers would disagree with the interviewee who, bemoaning a bad date, cries: “I could not think of anything worse than to fucking go to Laser Quest.”) Its most revealing section – in terms of technique and spirit – involves an unnamed detectorist who talks about his love of archaeology, the happy times he’s spent combing the beaches of Dover and Margate, a gold ring he once found. The kicker comes at the end: “I’ve been here since 2003. Just after the war in Iraq. We’re from Mosul. The city called Mosul.”</p> <p><em>• </em>The Passengers by Will Ashon is published by Faber (£14.99).

So far, the results only add to the considerable evidence showing election denialism remains remarkably powerful in Republican politics.</p> <p>One of the most consequential results on Tuesday was in Arizona, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/21/mark-finchem-trump-arizona-elections-secretary-of-state\">Mark Finchem</a>, a state lawmaker, easily won the Republican nomination to run for secretary of state, a position from which he would oversee elections. Few people in Arizona have fought as aggressively to overturn the 2020 election as Finchem has – he first tried to block Congress from recognizing Joe Biden’s legitimate victory in the state, and has since sought to spread misinformation and decertify the election, which is not possible.</p> <p>Finchem now joins Kristina Karamo in Michigan, Jim Marchant in Nevada, and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania as Republican nominees on the verge of claiming offices where they would have enormous power over elections (Karamo and Marchant are running for secretary of state, Mastriano is running for governor, where he would get to appoint the secretary of state). So far, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/29/1113707783/election-deniers-secretary-of-state-arizona-finchem\">three of the four secretary of state </a>candidates Trump has endorsed have won (the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/raffensperger-defeats-hice-georgia-election\">one exception</a> came in Georgia’s primary).</p> <p>“Having even one election denier in a statewide office would be a five-alarm fire for our elections,” Joanna Lydgate, CEO of States United Action, which is tracking election deniers running for office, said in a statement. “Recent primaries – particularly in Arizona and Michigan – should worry all of us as Americans. But voters have the power here. They can slow this trend in the primaries to come, and they can stop it in its tracks in the general election.”</p> <p>Before Tuesday’s vote, Finchem, who was endorsed by Trump, encouraged supporters to congregate at voting sites to watch for wrongdoing. “Stand 75ft away from the entrance of the polls,” Finchem told a crowd recently,<a href=\"https://www.azmirror.com/2022/08/02/republicans-are-urging-vigilantes-to-watch-ballot-drop-boxes-polling-locations-to-sniff-out-fraud/\"> according to the Arizona Mirror</a>. “The mere fact that you are there watching scares the hell out of them.”</p> <p>“If Mark Finchem is victorious this November, it could jeopardize the integrity of the 2024 presidential election and possibly could subvert the will of the people for years to come,” Ellen Kurtz, the founder and president of iVote, a liberal group focused on voting rights and elections, said in a statement. “No one who attempts to stop the peaceful transfer of power by attending a violent, deadly attack on our Capitol deserves to be on any ballot.”</p> <p>There’s deep concern that these officials, if elected, could use the power of their office to attempt to overturn the results of a valid election.</p> <p>Last week, I asked Chuck Coughlin, a Republican consultant in Arizona, what he thought Finchem would do if he was in charge of a future election and the result was in doubt. “He would not fall in line. He would follow the Donald Trump script of doing everything possible to be a disrupter if the election outcome is anything but what he wanted. I don’t see any go-along-to-get-along in Mark Finchem,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/arizona-republicans-kari-lake-mark-finchem\">he told me</a>.</p> <p>Kari Lake, a Republican who made election denialism a pillar of her campaign, also is leading in the Arizona governor’s race. Votes are still being counted, but if she wins, it would place election denialism front and center in a state where top Republicans have aggressively embraced it.</p> <p>There was one other big victory for Trump on Tuesday. Rusty Bowers, the term-limited GOP speaker of the Arizona House, lost his primary to a Trump-backed challenger in a state senate race. Bowers played a central role in rebuffing Trump’s efforts to overturn the election in his state and was censured by the state GOP after he testified in front of the panel investigating the January 6 attack.</p> <p>Acknowledging the headwinds he faced for going against the former president, Bowers <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/rusty-bowers-jan-6-committee-star-witness-loses-gop-primary-arizona-rcna40647\">told NBC</a> before the primary it would be a “miracle” if he won.</p> <h2>Also worth watching …</h2> <ul> <li><p>Arizona’s attorney general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/investigation-finds-claim-300-dead-people-voted-arizona-2020-election-false?ref=upstract.com&amp;curator=upstract.com&amp;utm_source=upstract.com\">debunked a claim</a> from Cyber Ninjas that nearly 300 dead people could have voted in the 2020 election in Arizona</p></li> <li><p>Some voters <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/08/02/gail-golec-told-stop-encouraging-arizona-voters-steal-pens/10218263002/\">were stealing pens</a> from voting sites in Arizona, egged on by a conspiracy theory</p></li> <li><p>A retired supreme court justice hired by Wisconsin Republicans to review the 2020 race publicly said in March lawmakers should consider decertifying the race.

If the eggs incubate above 31C (89F), the hatchlings will be female. Temperatures that waver between the two extremes will result in a mix of male and female baby turtles.</p> <p>Researchers also discovered that the warmer the sand, the higher the ratio of female turtles.</p> <p>“As the Earth experienced climate change, increased temperatures could result in skewed and even lethal incubation conditions, which would impact turtle species and other reptiles,” the National Ocean Service <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/temperature-dependent.html\">said.</a></p> <p>In a statement to Reuters, Bette Zirkelbach, manager of the Turtle Hospital in Marathon, Florida Keys, said: “The frightening thing is the last four summers in Florida have been the hottest summers on record.”</p> <p>She added: “Scientists that are studying sea turtle hatchlings and eggs have found no boy sea turtles, so only female sea turtles for the past four years.”</p> <p>The uneven male-to-female ratio is a growing concern among scientists who worry that the sea turtle population will eventually become stunted.</p> <p>Melissa Rosales Rodriguez, a sea turtle keeper at the Miami Zoo’s recently opened Sea Turtle Hospital, <a href=\"https://us.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/florida-turtles-born-female-climate-change/index.html\">told</a> Reuters, “Over the years, you’re going to see a sharp decline in their population because we just don’t have the genetic diversity… We don’t have the male-to-female ratio needed in order to be able to have successful breeding sessions.”</p> <p>In addition to facing an increasing number of female turtles, the Sea Turtle Hospital is also currently working to address fibropapillomatosis, a potentially deadly disease among sea turtles that causes cauliflower-like tumors to develop on the body including the eyes and mouth. The tumors could also form in internal organs.</p> <p>“The Turtle hospital was the first.

A Greater Anglia customer adviser called Georgie later wrote that the tortoise was injured and had been taken to a specialist team for treatment. 'We have been informed that he will make a full recovery,' the adviser updated., 2:B - 'Oh my God, look at them – it’s amazing,' she said about the fans in Wembley after the match. 'Thank you to every single person who came out to support us. This is unreal. This is what dreams are made of. As a young girl watching women’s football and now this, wow, it’s unbelievable.', 3:D - The other three are all from David Copperfield. Nelly Dean is the narrator from the world's most miserable novel, Wuthering Heights., 4:A - Of course it was a cup of tea. If they had been swigging beer the whole enterprise would have ended in a disaster., 5:B - One litre of water weighs one kilogram under standard conditions. That is one of the reasons that metric is better than imperial, because all of the measurements work together. Ancient Sumerian cubits, of course, are used to measure everything around the quiz master's house, even if the Sumerians themselves never used them to measure weight., 6:A - The city is located on the east bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of southern province of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong to the south. It has a population of more than 17 million., 7:B - 338,000 troops were rescued from Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940., 8:B - Stein died in Paris at the age of 72 in 1946., 9:D - One krona is subdivided into 100 öre, although the country stopped producing öre coins over a decade ago and eveything tends to be rounded to the nearest krona. The picture features Brazil scoring against Sweden in the 1958 final, and is a bit of a giveaway that this question has been shoe-horned in from a previous version of the quiz that was not dedicated to Cribbins., 10:A - High &amp; Dry was on the second single to be released from the album in 1995, coupled with Planet Telex, and it reached No 17 in the UK singles chart., 11:C - The Israeli Beresheet probe was meant to be the first private lander to touch down on the moon, but crashed along with its payload including some of the hardiest animals ever to survive on earth –&nbsp;Tardigrades. Some scientists believe that they might still be there, watching human affairs keenly and closely., 12:A - Todd wrote 10 novels about the disturbing scarecrow who comes to life between 1936 and 1963., 13:D - Crowe played Kenny Larkin in four episodes in 1987. Heath Ledger appeared in Home &amp; Away. Jackman was apparently offered a role in Neighbours but turned it down. Eric Bana is just making up the numbers here, to be honest., 14:C - Bats are one of the most widely distributed groups of mammals, and new bat species are constantly discovered, the trust says. In its Bats of the World factsheet, a guide to everything the Thursday quiz knows about bats, it puts the number of species at approximately 1,300. , 15:C - Penda and Samara had previously been given as names for Lt Uhura in games and books, but it was a mention of the name in the 2009 movie that made Nyota properly canonical.

It was an excellent decision. The well-signposted <a href=\"https://craigies.co.uk/\">Craigie’s Farm</a>, at South Queensferry near Edinburgh, beckoned me towards an array of fruits as sustenance for my cycling. I filled up on raspberries and cherries and took veg too for the camp later.

Before the start of every season we’re looking for a reason why Bayern Munich might not win the Bundesliga, and it has begun to feel like a vain hope for genuine title competition. In May Bayern were crowned champions for the 10th campaign in a row, and the <em>Rekordmeister</em> have been run to such an exemplary standard that few can see an imminent end to the medley.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet this time there is a new cast running the show, with Oliver Kahn as CEO in a post-Hoeness and Rummenigge world, having to prove his authority in tandem with Hasan Salihamidzic, a sporting director who has never fully convinced. Bayern’s fabled stability has never really rested on who’s on the pitch or even who’s on the bench, but instead has come from higher up. Kahn and Salihamidzic are in the spotlight, and the rolling saga over Robert Lewandowski’s future was as delicate a summer task as could have been imagined for them.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/jul/06/football-transfer-window-summer-2022-mens-deals-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1-club-guides\">Football transfer window summer 2022 – Europe’s top five men’s leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bayern always faced a summer of reckoning in 2022, with Manuel Neuer, Thomas Müller, Serge Gnabry and Lewandowski having been having contracts running out in 2023. There was always going to be an odd one out too. Bayern, not being Barcelona, realise that not everybody can get paid. But when we looked at who the gooseberry might be, few figured it would be Lewandowski.</p> <p>The writing was on the wall from the point in spring when he was offered a mere year’s extension on the same salary, leaving a scratch on the Poland striker’s ego which never faded, hardening his desire to split. Whisper it, but maybe a more fluid front line is more Julian Nagelsmann’s cup of tea anyway. Nobody is pretending Lewandowski, the scorer of 344 Bayern goals, isn’t a loss, but the signing of Sadio Mané gives Nagelsmann options – a front three with Gnabry as a false 9, or a front two of Gnabry and Mané, which looked red-hot in the Super Cup win over RB Leipzig. Bayern’s already potent attack could blossom further, as when Napoli lost 36-goal Gonzalo Higuaín in 2016 and ended up scoring 94 Serie A goals the following season, 14 more than they did with him.&nbsp;</p> <p>Conversely it was always Nagelsmann’s priority to strengthen the defence, which he felt was behind last term’s Champions League disappointments. The signing of Matthijs de Ligt underlined this – Bayern have only ever paid a higher fee for Lucas Hernández, who will partner the Dutchman – though the coach needs to respond to the accusation that his formation is too cavalier. The depth of flair is beguiling, though. Jamal Musiala, still only 19 but the man of the match in the Super Cup against Leipzig (a performance described as “world class” by Nagelsmann), looks ready for a huge season and Marcel Sabitzer, so disappointing in his first campaign at the club, is standing in well for the injured Leon Goretzka and “one of the winners of pre-season”, according to Nagelsmann. If Kahn and Salihamidzic will be under the microscope, it still feels as if it would take mismanagement of epic proportions to make Bayern slip from the domestic summit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"883cbc80e3d35f941b76312bd70d965c03957edc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/883cbc80e3d35f941b76312bd70d965c03957edc/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dortmund’s Karim Adeyemi celebrates with his teammates after scoring the 3-0 lead during the German Cup first round\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dortmund have a plan this time, but can they get closer to Bayern?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least it feels as if Borussia Dortmund are closer to having a plan than before. They dealt with their defensive issues, bringing in Niklas Süle and Nico Schlotterbeck with Salih Özcan to anchor ahead of them, plus Germany forward Karim Adeyemi. Even if Hans-Joachim Watzke has cautioned against expecting instant results, the return of the popular Edin Terzic as coach and the swift completion of their transfer business had created real optimism.</p> <p>The new striker Sébastien Haller’s diagnosis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/19/sebastien-haller-dortmund-training-testicular-tumour\">with testicular cancer</a> has dampened the mood, of course. Clearly Haller’s health as he recovers is the most important aspect of the conversation, but he represents a big sporting loss as well. Quite apart from his prolific Champions League form for Ajax last season, he was so attractive to Dortmund for his intelligence and strength offering to bring Marco Reus and Adeyemi into the game as well (an aspect in which he might have actually represented an upgrade on Erling Haaland). His medium-term absence means BVB will need to fish back into the market for a replacement, with players including Edinson Cavani and Köln’s Anthony Modeste linked in the last week.&nbsp;</p> <p>Leipzig, so improved by the mid-season arrival of Domenico Tedesco last term, have shown real ambition in making the record signing of David Raum (continuing the now-Germany left-back’s meteoric rise) and in the attempts to bring back Timo Werner from Chelsea, teasing that they might move away from their strictly youth-based model.

These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world.</p>\n    <p>NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon.</p>\n    <p>NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated.</p>\n    <p>Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high.</p>\n    <p>In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the threats from communicable diseases, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/Aids combined.</p>\n    <p>'A common condition' is a new Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world: their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses.</p>\n    <p><b>Tracy McVeigh, editor</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He said advocacy efforts had helped relax regulations in Kerala and other parts of India, but that still only 350kg of opioids a year were being consumed, whereas he estimated that 30,000kg were now needed.</p> \n<p>Gary Rodin, who is the director of the Toronto-based Global Institute of Psychosocial, Palliative and End-of-Life Care and has carried out <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2015.62.1615\">research into habits of prescribing opioids</a>, said the increase in rates of diseases such as cancer and diabetes in low- and middle-income countries demanded greater emphasis on relieving pain and psychological distress.</p> \n<p>“Maybe 100 years ago that would have been a large part of medicine. As medicine has gotten more specialised and technologised, people have paid more attention to Cat scans and MRIs and blood tests than they have to the suffering of the patient. They haven’t asked enough about the suffering,” he said.</p> \n<p>That has resulted in more aggressive chemotherapy treatment, Rodin said, even at stages when it is unlikely to work and when the body struggles to handle it.</p> \n<p>“Suicide rates are very high in advanced disease. Psychological distress is very common; family distress is very common. There are lots of approaches which we have evidence will help, but we don’t do nearly enough to support that.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dc64ca6bbdcc3e0bd95ad0cb4d7819f08a8db5b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dc64ca6bbdcc3e0bd95ad0cb4d7819f08a8db5b/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma has had to settle thousands of lawsuits over its role in the US opioid crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma has had to settle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/12/purdue-pharma-oxycontin-maker-settlement-lawsuits\">thousands of lawsuits</a> over its role in the US opioid crisis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Talbot/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Palliative care can be a cheaper way to ease the suffering of terminally ill patients and could be made more available by relaxing laws and training healthcare workers to administer painkillers and ease psychological distress, Rodin said.</p> \n<p>Julia Downing, the chief executive of the International Children’s Palliative Care Network, said neglecting a patient’s pain can have a significant impact on their quality of life.</p> \n<p>“The implications are quite broad … If they’re unable to work, the family will become poorer and poorer, and then they can’t pay for school fees, so the children can’t go to school.

This means that when we try to have discussions, our work becomes harder because many minds are primed against opioids,” said Rajagopal.</p> \n<p>Downing said progress has been made in Uganda, India and Kenya but more needed to be done not just on legislation but also on training medical staff.</p> \n<p>Zipporah Ali, a Kenyan palliative care doctor, said some progress has been made in her country to relax opioid laws.</p> \n<p>“There was a time a patient came to me in so much pain with a neck tumour that was so swollen, he just wanted to die. But I started him on treatment with high doses of pain management and steroids. The next week in the hospital he came and grabbed me to say: ‘Thank you. I don’t want to die any more.’” said Ali. “We are not curing the disease, but it can make you comfortable.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/04/javid-denies-truss-tax-cuts-plan-will-lead-to-increased-borrowing","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T09:23:55Z","webTitle":"Javid denies Truss tax cuts plan will lead to increased borrowing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/04/javid-denies-truss-tax-cuts-plan-will-lead-to-increased-borrowing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/04/javid-denies-truss-tax-cuts-plan-will-lead-to-increased-borrowing","fields":{"headline":"Javid denies Truss tax cuts plan will lead to increased borrowing","trailText":"Latest high-profile backer of Tory leadership candidate says proposals ‘risky’ but not inflationary","byline":"Aubrey Allegretti Political correspondent","body":"<p>Swingeing tax cuts pledged by Liz Truss will not lead to dramatically increased government borrowing or fuel inflation, her latest high-profile supporter, Sajid Javid, has claimed, in response to accusations the Conservative leadership frontrunner’s “dangerous” plans would exacerbate the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>Taking aim at Rishi Sunak, Javid, his former Treasury protege, hit out at the ex-chancellor’s “business-as-usual” approach and added: “We can’t rely on increasing taxes again and again.”</p> <p>Nearly a month to the day since the pair’s sensational resignation led to the downfall of Boris Johnson, Javid declined to endorse Sunak and instead backed Truss to become prime minister.</p> <p>He said her immediate tax cut pledges were “risky”, but told Times Radio: “Not cutting taxes now is also risky and I think it’s the riskier option. There’s no risk-free option here and any leader has to grip this and come up with the right policy and I think that’s what Liz is offering.”</p> <p>Having launched a failed attempt to be leader himself after quitting as health secretary last month, Javid became the latest in a trickle of MPs to jump on to Truss’s campaign.</p> <p>He told Times Radio that Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts had about £31bn of “fiscal headroom” by 2024/25, “so that’s the first thing you can use to make tax cuts now”.</p> <p>Not going ahead with a planned increase in corporation tax from 19% to 25% in April wouldn’t affect inflation figures, Javid said.</p> <p>“It is not inflationary to not go ahead with a tax increase,” he said. “I don’t buy this argument that the things Liz is proposing, somehow they are all going to lead to higher inflation. In the long term they are going to help to fix the economy and that is the most important thing.”</p> <p>A similar argument was made by the attorney general, Suella Braverman, also a Truss supporter, who said on Thursday: “We can’t afford not to cut taxes.”</p> <p>It came hours before the Bank of England was expected to raise interest rates by half a percentage point – the biggest increase since 1995. The energy price cap will also be changed quarterly instead of every six months, Ofgem announced on Thursday.</p> <p>Truss’s plans were called dangerous by Mel Stride, a Sunak supporter who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, given the economic outlook this autumn.</p> <p>“What we must do now is avoid stoking the inflation and making the problem even worse,” Stride told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “One of the ways you can make the problem very significantly worse is by coming forward with large-scale, tens of billions of pounds’ worth, of unfunded tax cuts.”</p> <p>He added: “The big decision, fiscally, here is around tax. You have to do it in a measured way and at the right time but not start coming forward with tens of billions of unfunded tax cuts right now.</p> <p>“I think that would be really quite dangerous.”</p> <p>Despite Sunak trailing by up to 30 points in polls of Conservative members, who have a month to vote in the leadership election, Stride said his candidate would “absolutely not” concede and claimed there was a “huge disconnect” between survey results and his experience.</p> <p>Two Thatcher-era cabinet ministers also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/liz-truss-brushes-off-concerns-about-88bn-black-hole-in-her-budget\">described Truss’s immediate tax cuts as reckless</a>, and said the former prime minister would have been more welcoming of Sunak’s plan to wait until inflation was settled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final TV debate will be hosted at 8pm on Thursday night by Sky News, although the candidates will not go head-to-head.

Australia has wasted two decades in a pointless debate led by vested interests, and we are now taking action.</p> \n   <p> The Government’s Bill could be more ambitious, and it should be more ambitious – but it’s a huge step in the right direction. This is an historic day.</p> \n   <p> Climate Change was the number one issue for the people of Mackellar at the last election, while the people of Australia voted for strong climate action at the last election. By working in good faith with the Albanese Government I believe I have been able to strengthen and improve this legislation. I want to thank Minister Bowen for his consultative approach and for working with my crossbench colleagues and I in good faith.</p> \n   <p>I hope this collegiate and consultative approach continues throughout the term.</p> \n   <p> As part of my discussions with Minister Bowen I, along with my crossbench colleagues, urged him to alter the language used around the government’s 2030 emissions target. Instead of the 43% target being described as a ceiling to Australia’s ambition, we now have, enshrined in law, a minimum 2030 emissions target of 43%.</p> \n   <p>I will now be working with the government to ensure that the right policies and programs are in place to beat this target so we achieve closer to the 50% reduction in emissions that the science says the world must reach by 2030. I will hold the government to account on this and will continue to push for ambitious economy-wide climate action.</p> \n   <p>In addition, I urged the government to amend their draft Bill to ensure there is a statutory review of the legislation after five years and then every decade thereafter and that the Bill has clear foundational objectives that anchors the Act to the Paris Accord to hold this and all future governments to account. I am pleased that all of these suggestions have been accepted by the Albanese Government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T06:02:07.758Z\">at 7.02am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb5a4b8f08b58de97ec4df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T05:35:52.283Z\">6.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Question time ends on a busy day in Canberra</strong></p> \n  <p>Well, that was quite the afternoon, to follow quite the morning.</p> \n  <p>The rain has not let up all day in Canberra, which has left some MPs and staffers anxious they might be delayed flying out of the capital – and there is a bit of a hurried vibe to the afternoon proceedings.</p> \n  <p>The next sitting isn’t until 5 September and everyone seems very keen on waving Canberra goodbye, at least in the short term.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T05:43:41.261Z\">at 6.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb57a18f08b58de97ec4c8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T05:23:46.192Z\">6.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Conservationists welcome Plibersek’s move to block Clive Palmer mine</strong></p> \n  <p>The Queensland Conservation Council has welcomed the news Murph reported that <strong>Tanya Plibersek </strong>plans to block <strong>Clive Palmer’s</strong> application for a new coal mine.</p> \n  <p>The council’s director <strong>Dave Copeman</strong> says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a victory for Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef.</p> \n   <p>Building a new thermal coal mine 10km from the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area was an extreme, dangerous proposal, even for Clive Palmer.</p> \n   <p>This is a sensible application of the Environmental Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act.

My electorate of Fowler bears the brunt of the nation’s migrant settlement city. It has one of the highest national unemployment rates over the past decade, almost 10% and more than double the national average. How will the prime minister commit to working with me to lower the unemployment rate and lower the cost of living for struggling families of Fowler.</p> \n  <p><strong>Albanese:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I thank the member for her question and just last week we had a constructive one on one meeting about how the government can assist people in Fowler electorate around the Liverpool area in south-west Sydney, an area that I am familiar with. </p> \n   <p>The member is quite right to point to socioeconomic disadvantage that is there in Fowler. It has a higher proportion of new migrants to Australia than the average across the country. </p> \n   <p>In particular, many newer groups have gone to south-west Sydney to settle to make Australia their home. Over a period of time, what I know is that communities like the Vietnamese community in Fowler, just like the one in Marrickville, where I recall the member for Fowler living in my electorate some years ago where we first met. That community has proven to be a great success. </p> \n   <p>Newer communities require that additional support such as the people who have fled war-torn Syria in recent times. My government is very conscious of that.</p> \n   <p>That is one of the reasons why I have encouraged the member to engage in the jobs and skills summit process, to have a local forum and offered the government’s support to provide advice, speakers, to provide the full force of government to have local forums which is on offer to anyone around this chamber as well. </p> \n   <p>What we need to do is to work with the local business community, to work with Tafe, the three levels of fovernment and I discussed with premier Perrottet today at the National Cabinet and along with other premiers how we can make sure arising out of that we give Australians more opportunities for jobs, through better Tafe funding, better training, making sure that we identify those opportunities which are there. </p> \n   <p>One of the things we know is that long term unemployment can be a scourge. In particular I am aware that in south-west Sydney there are pockets of housing estates, whereby disadvantage is entrenched. When I asked a question the other day about social housing, I spoke about the need to have a mix of housing as well. I have raised with state premiers as well as with local government how we get better investment as part of this government’s commitment through our housing Australia future fund and other investment vehicles to get increased support for a mix of housing so that you don’t have people growing up in communities where they can’t see people that they can aspire to be one day. </p> \n   <p>I thank the member for Fowler for her question.

If that consultation process brings to our attention some issues around the implementation of that promise, then we will take that seriously. </p> \n   <p>In addition to that, there is, as the member is no doubt aware, a big agenda around multinational taxes from the OECD which the Americans and others have been leading as well. </p> \n   <p>When I was with the governor of the reserve bank at the G20 meetings in Indonesia, one of the topics of conversation with secretary <strong>Janet Yellen</strong> and others was about how the world can work together on the two pillars of the OECD agenda, to try and make sure we fix this problem in the global economy and in our economy, where it is too easy for multinational corporations to move their debt or profits around the world in a way that sells countries short and makes it harder for us to fund the things that we really care about – health care and education and all of those federal government programs that we need to fund in the context of all of our other budget constraints. </p> \n   <p>Once again, like the answer to the question from another colleague in the house earlier this week, if not last week, <strong>we don’t intend to go down the path that you are asking us about but we intend to take meaningful action on multinational tax.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T04:44:11.589Z\">at 5.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb49d98f0892e28b4ab78f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/christopher-knaus\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T04:24:58.455Z\">5.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>ACT’s Covid death toll passes 100</strong></p> \n  <p>The <strong>Australian Capital Territory hit a grime milestone</strong> this morning.

global heating</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Adam Bandt</strong> is moving his amendment now, making the point that Labor’s targets mean “overshooting 2C”.<br></p> \n  <p>“If you think what we are seeing now is bad with the fires and the floods, Labor’s targets mean twice as bad.”</p> \n  <p><strong>Bandt:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When someone has made the problem worse you need to act quicker to fix it, not slow down. </p> \n   <p>The Climate Council, the climate targets authority, our Pacific Island neighbours, the world’s scientists have all said very clearly if you want to stop global warming exceeding 2C you need to have at least 50% cut, but if you want to limit it to 1.5C – to give us a chance of the reef surviving and the 60,000 jobs that depend on it, to give the Pacific Islands what they are asking for and what, indeed, I think this government just signed up to a couple of weeks ago when it signed up to a communique that said it was committed to limiting global heating to 1.5C – ... you need pollution cuts of 75%. </p> \n   <p>That is crystal clear, that is the science, that is why we are doing that. Anything less and you are giving up on 1.5C. </p> \n   <p>As the member for Ryan eloquently put it yesterday, you have to understand what Labor’s targets mean. Labor’s targets mean, according to the Climate Council, the climate target panel, overshooting 2C. </p> \n   <p>That is what it means. If you think what we are seeing now is bad with the fires and the floods, Labor’s targets mean twice as bad. </p> \n   <p>It means quite as much heating in our planet which will mean an exponential lift in the risk to human life and the risk to our environment. We are not doing this just to cut pollution by a little bit, we are doing this to try and stop climate change becoming a runaway train reaction. </p> \n   <p>So the next time there are fires, the next time there are floods, when we see the Great Barrier Reef bleaching next, know that that is what Labor’s targets are all about. That is what they are designed to achieve, 2C or more of heating. Climate analytics and Climate Council all says that. We need to do better. We need to support these amendments.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a6ff741138e26d290bf308579a45ab7b312a97b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6ff741138e26d290bf308579a45ab7b312a97b/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian Greens leader Adam Bandt speaks during debate on the climate change bill in the House of Representatives on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian Greens leader Adam Bandt speaks during debate on the climate change bill in the House of Representatives on Thursday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T01:35:45.452Z\">at 2.35am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb1bae8f0878ca99e20b0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T01:07:32.957Z\">2.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Adam Bandt’s</strong> amendment is up next:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>(Mr Bandt</em><em>*</em><em>)</em></p> \n   <p>(1) Clause 10, page 5 (line 10), omit “43%”, substitute “at least 75%”.</p> \n   <p><strong><em>[2030 target]</em></strong></p> \n   <p>(2) Clause 10, page 5 (line 16), omit “2050”, substitute “2035 and working towards negative emissions thereafter”.</p> \n   <p><strong><em>[net zero target]</em></strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But given the <strong>Andrew Wilkie</strong> amendment failed to get government support, this one will too.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T01:11:30.727Z\">at 2.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb19fa8f0878ca99e20af7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T01:00:20.231Z\">2.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government won’t be supporting this amendment. <strong>Chris Bowen </strong>says the government took its 43% target to the election and that is what the mandate is for.</p> \n  <p>So this one won’t pass.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb19eb8f0892e28b4ab67e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T00:59:33.670Z\">1.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Andrew Wilkie</strong> is now moving his amendments:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>(Mr Wilkie)</em></p> \n   <p>(1) Clause 10, page 5 (line 10), omit “43%”, substitute “75%”.</p> \n   <p><strong><em>[2030 emissions reduction target]</em></strong></p> \n   <p>(2) Clause 10, page 5 (line 16), omit “2050”, substitute “2035, at the latest”.</p> \n   <p><strong><em>[net zero emissions reduction target]</em></strong></p> \n   <p>(3) Clause 12, page 7 (line 18), at the end of subclause (1), add:</p> \n   <p> ; and (e) Australia’s scope 3 emissions of greenhouse gas.</p> \n   <p><strong><em>[annual climate change statement]</em></strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T01:01:45.816Z\">at 2.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb18bb8f0878ca99e20ae9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T00:56:01.319Z\">1.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW records 33 more Covid deaths and Victoria nine</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>NSW is reporting 33 more lives lost to Covid in the last day, with 2,213 people being treated for the virus in hospital.

The extra 25% they will pay on profits only applies from three weeks ago, meaning the vast fortunes made before then will be untouched. In part, they are profiteering from war: the horrors of Ukraine and sanctions against Russia have sent prices for oil and gas surging. The killing fields of armed conflict have often proven to be lucrative business opportunities. That history often repeats this sordid enterprise makes it no less grotesque.</p> <p>The energy companies know the case for a far more ambitious tax is inarguable, and so they resort to desperate spin. Higher rates will mean confiscating money desperately needed for green investment, they cry, imperilling the transition to the clean energy required to preserve human civilisation from the existential threat of the climate emergency. Don’t believe them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/02/big-oil-profits-energy-bills-windfall-tax\">Big oil’s quarterly profits hit £50bn as UK braces for even higher energy bills</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For a start, despite their attempts to “greenwash” their reputations as climate fighters, the world’s biggest oil and gas companies spend more than £150m a year lobbying politicians to halt, water down or destroy policies required to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/22/top-oil-firms-spending-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-says-report\">tackle the climate crisis</a>. That big energy has thrown <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/oil-and-gas-firms-have-given-1m-to-boris-johnsons-conservatives/\">£1m at the Tories</a> since the last election is not the whimsical splashing around of money: it’s because they trust the Conservatives most to forestall demands for tougher action to be taken against them. This was hardly naive: witness the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/26/sunak-announces-windfall-tax-energy-firms\">90% tax breaks</a> – for investing in fossil fuel extraction – which Rishi Sunak handed them, allowing them to dramatically slash their tax bills.</p> <p>In any case, the killer fact is that 60% of their profits go directly to shareholders: none of that is funding investment in anything, let alone clean energy. Since 2010, they’ve handed out nearly <a href=\"https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/reports/drilling-down\">£200bn to shareholders</a>: imagine how this money could instead have been used to promote clean energy, as well as reducing household bills. “They’re not using cash to invest – and when they do invest, it’s still fossil fuel heavy,” says Mathew Lawrence, director of the Common Wealth thinktank. “It’s better to see them not as energy companies but as institutions whose main goal is managing cashflows to reward investors.”</p> <p>But not all years yield such bumper profits, say the energy companies: what of the lean periods? Even then, if you average out the years, big energy is awash with cash. Their apologists’ opposition to a sweeping tax becomes ever more desperate: such as claiming it will hammer pensioners, a point comprehensively rebutted by Common Wealth’s research which highlights that the main pension funds own less than 0.2% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/08/windfall-tax-on-oil-giants-wont-hurt-british-pensioners-thinktank-finds\">BP and Shell’s shares </a>. And would anyone consider Norway – which enjoys one of the highest standards of livings on Earth – to be financially reckless.<strong> </strong>Yet its permanent windfall tax – <a href=\"https://weownit.org.uk/act-now/public-ownership-energy-petition\">worth 56%</a> on top of corporation tax – means that for every £100 they collect from barrels of oil in the North Sea, <a href=\"http://priceofoil.org/2021/05/11/uk-needs-to-act-on-oil-and-gas/\">Britain collects just £8</a>.</p> <p>While being coerced by popular pressure into imposing a more drastic tax on the energy companies is the most we can expect under Tory rule, that does not mean it should be the limit of Labour’s ambitions. When Keir Starmer was asked on national television during the 2020 Labour leadership race if he supported renationalising energy, he stuck his hand up, only later <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/19606103.starmer-attacked-apparent-u-turn-energy-nationalisation/\">to renege</a> on this promise, along with so many of his other campaign commitments. But taxes only offer temporary redress, rather than dealing with a structurally broken industry which should never have been surrendered by the government to profiteers. How can it be that Britain is one of only two European nations to have entirely flogged off its <a href=\"https://weownit.org.uk/act-now/public-ownership-energy-petition\">transmission grid</a> , for example, with National Grid frittering away £1.4bn in dividends to shareholders in 2021 alone, instead of using it for investment?</p> <p>French president Emmanuel Macron can hardly be construed as a leftwing firebrand, and yet his government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/12/edf-shares-surge-france-nationalise-8bn-energy\">taking full control</a> of the already mostly nationalised EDF energy firm. Because it’s publicly owned, the government could simply order the company to take a £7bn hit to protect families from a cost-of-living crisis by limiting bill hikes to just 4% this year. As pro-public ownership organisation We Own It highlights, academic research points to energy prices that are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988313000911\">up to 30% lower</a> under public ownership – here is an obviously viable long-term solution. </p> <p>A social order which robs struggling households to shove astronomical dividends into the bank accounts of well-to-do shareholders is irretrievably broken. Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss’s position is to denounce failed economic orthodoxies that have prevailed for years, concluding that the problem is that taxes are too high on big business – rather than, say, energy companies bleeding British families dry. Her blind refusal to acknowledge the reality speaks to a political party inhabiting a parallel universe. Britain’s energy industry should never have been reduced to a cash cow for profiteers. At the very least, our frontline politicians should be shamed into raiding these super-profits to offer their citizens a life raft. As it is, they’ve been left to drown.</p> <ul> <li><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p></li>

But way better flavour.” Remove the frilly silk beneath the husk, rewrap the cob and – to prevent the husk from burning – soak it in water for 20 minutes, then drain. Grill the cob for 20 minutes, rotating regularly.</p> <p>To flavour the cob, Matsunaga opens the husk, slathers it in herb butter (30g of butter a cob, blitzed with 10g of wild garlic, dill, lovage, parsley, etc), rewraps it and grills for another three minutes. Finally, she removes the husk and serves with salad and flatbread.</p> <p>Alternatively, after 10 minutes of grilling, you can season the cob with salt and butter and, after 20 minutes more on the grill, serve it topped with pickled ginger, spring onions and miso mayonnaise (2½ tbsp mayo, ideally Kewpie, mixed with ½ tsp white miso): “For an umami kick, sprinkle over katsuobushi (smoked skipjack tuna).”</p> <p>The renowned corn “ribs” at London’s Fallow restaurant are usually fried. They won’t curl up as dramatically on the barbecue, but their fresh, smoky taste is delicious, says the co-owner, Will Murray.</p> <p>Take two corn cobs and, using a large, sharp knife (warning: keep fingers clear and work slowly, with your weight behind the blade), trim the ends flat and cut each cob in two to produce four small cobs.</p> <p>Take each one, stand it on end and split it in half by cutting down through the core. You now have eight pieces of corn that are flat on the core side. Taking each piece one by one, place them core-side down and cut them in half lengthways, which will eventually produce 16 “ribs”.</p> <p>In salted boiling water, cook the ribs for four minutes. Drain and grill for four to five minutes over white coals, core up, kernels down.</p> <p>To season, combine in a bowl: 1½ tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 1½ tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp smoked chilli flakes, 1½ tbsp sea salt and 50g of butter.

He marinades large portobellos (eight in 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 2 tsp Marmite and 1 tsp dark miso, whisked with 6 tbsp olive oil, black pepper and the juice of half a lime) for four hours, turning them once.</p> <p>Rushmer barbecues them (with the lid-down – “keeps them juicy”) over a medium-high heat for four minutes on each side. Stuff two per person into a bun with garnishes. “Mushrooms have a brilliant umami flavour – this amps things up,” he says.</p> <p>Mushrooms mimicking pulled pork? That works too, says Sam Evans, the co-author of The Hang Fire Cookbook. To feed four people, shred eight king oyster mushrooms along their lengths with a fork, seasoning the shreds with salt, ¾ tsp each of chilli powder and black pepper and a bit more than 1 tbsp of vegetable oil.</p> <p>Get a cast-iron skillet or metal frying pan (nothing with a nonstick coating or plastic handles) “screaming hot” over your barbecue coals, before adding the mushrooms. Don’t move them. “Hold your nerve,” urges Evans.</p> <p>Drive off most of the moisture and sear them, before jostling to ensure they’re evenly cooked. Add 3 tbsp barbecue sauce and a few dashes of mushroom ketchup, and mix through. Serve on toasted brioche with coleslaw.</p> <h2>Aubergine</h2> <p>A smoky, garlicky dip and side dish, mirza ghasemi is “last meal on Earth” territory for the chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/20/you-can-have-fun-and-experiment-inside-the-test-kitchens-where-restaurants-cook-up-new-dishes\">Leyli Homayoonfar</a>. The barbecue brains at Caerphilly’s Bab Haus, Homayoonfar has created an entirely outdoor, coal-roasted mirza ghasemi, which, while not authentic to her Iranian grandmother’s recipe, still bangs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f4432c7e9d4021a8299a37e1dd5a99d356972efc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4432c7e9d4021a8299a37e1dd5a99d356972efc/0_252_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Aubergines on the grill at Bab Haus, Caerphilly\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aubergines on the grill at Bab Haus, Caerphilly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Leyli Homayoonfar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To serve two to four people, grill two large aubergines (“pierced to prevent them exploding”) directly on red-hot coals alongside a foil-wrapped garlic bulb. Over 10 to 15 minutes, turn the garlic and aubergines until they char, soften and collapse. Place the aubergines in a clingfilm-covered bowl – “trapped steam will help peel the skin off”.</p> <p>While the aubergines are cooling, char four tomatoes on the grill. Let the ingredients cool, then scoop out the aubergine flesh and, with the skinned tomatoes and eight garlic cloves, thoroughly mash to a dip-able consistency, adding plenty of olive oil and salt to taste.</p> <p>The garlic cloves should pop easily from their skins, says Homayoonfar: “I couldn’t believe how much garlic my grandmother put in.” Finally, crush ¼ tsp saffron with salt and add 1 tbsp warm water. Stir the saffron liquid through. Serve with Persian sangak flatbread or pitta.</p> <h2>Broccoli</h2> <p>Low-in-sugar brassicas, says Rushmer, “can take a real charring and taste smoky rather than acridly bitter”.</p> <p>A quartered broccoli will cook in four to five minutes over white coals (turn regularly), and can be simply dressed with salt and oil. Peter Dantanus, a chef at Brighton’s Burnt Orange, loves how broccoli “is like a sponge, absorbing flavours”. Dress a quartered broccoli by mixing together 100g tahini, 10ml water, 40ml lime juice, and – “slowly, so it doesn’t split” – 100ml olive oil. Season with salt and top the dressed broccoli with spring onion and black sesame seeds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e113070f49ba912539f00fc2801bb853af874393\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e113070f49ba912539f00fc2801bb853af874393/0_1109_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broccoli at Burnt Orange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Broccoli at Burnt Orange</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Greens</h2> <p>Forget pan-frying, much less steaming, cabbage. All the cool kids are chargrilling pointy hispi cabbages. To serve four, James Cochran, the chef-owner at London’s 12.51, quarters a hispi, salts it, lightly brushes it with oil and cooks it on all three sides for 10 to 12 minutes. “Go quite dark on the char. The layers create texture, with some parts extra-crispy, others meltingly tender,” he says.</p> <p>Finish it on the barbecue, dressing the cabbage with 100g soft butter mixed with scotch bonnet jam or mango chutney. Top each plate with crispy shallots, fried garlic and fresh dill or chervil.</p> <p>If you want to use a cheaper, sturdier white cabbage, the food writer and barbecue expert Melissa Thompson, the author of Motherland: A Jamaican Cookbook, offers a clever tip: immerse it in water briefly. That will trap droplets between the cabbage’s leaves, which will help it steam as it grills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9027295b7dfa9c78195805dae151bf4898799005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9027295b7dfa9c78195805dae151bf4898799005/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lettuces are done in minutes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lettuces are done in minutes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa Romerein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At London’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/06/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-smokestak-london-one-glorious-considered-pose\">Smokestak</a> restaurant, the founder David Carter barbecues seasonal greens – from winter kales and cabbages (“brush with beef fat, turn, grill and repeat, to build beautifully caramelised layers of flavour”) to halved baby gem lettuces done in a few minutes.</p> <p>Dress barbecue lettuce with salsa rossa. There are numerous recipes online, but Carter’s secret ingredient for his take on the spicy Italian tomato sauce is Lee Kum Kee’s chilli garlic sauce.</p> <h2>Cauliflower</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9429a2015a0bd4379137b9b5ff8bb608568c0736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9429a2015a0bd4379137b9b5ff8bb608568c0736/0_94_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cauliflower at Firebird\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cauliflower at Firebird</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When whole-roasting, “always use plain white cauliflowers”, advises Nikos Kontogiannatos, the chef at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jul/08/firebird-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\">London’s Firebird</a>. Remove any leaves and drizzle the head with olive oil, season it, wrap it and, using a knife, poke several holes in the foil: “It allows smoke to permeate the cauliflower evenly.”</p> <p>After your barbecue has died down to a steady heat, place the cauliflower among the coals for 45 minutes, turning every 10 minutes. When done, a knife should slide in easily. </p> <p>Kontogiannatos then peels back the foil and, for five minutes in the barbecue, glazes the cauliflower with an apple sauce made by bringing 75ml apple juice, 30ml cider vinegar, 60g each of caster and demerara sugar, ½ cinnamon stick, 1 tsp fresh thyme, 1 tsp smoked paprika and ½ tsp black pepper to the boil, then reducing it by half to a honey-like consistency.</p> <p>Serve the cauliflower, split between three to four people, with a salad of tomatoes, red onion and mint.</p> <h2>Potatoes</h2> <p>You do not need advice on cooking jacket spuds in a fire, but Tomer Amedi, the executive chef at <a href=\"https://www.pascor.co.uk/\">London’s Pascor</a>, has a gamechanging topping. For four potatoes, combine 160g butter, 40g chopped anchovies, 2 tbsp chopped fresh oregano, the zest of one lemon and one orange, black pepper and 50g of toasted, chopped pine nuts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3afd77a031f7313579281fcb1212c0edac7c9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3afd77a031f7313579281fcb1212c0edac7c9b/0_1286_3519_2112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fire-cooked jacket potato at Pascor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fire-cooked jacket potato at Pascor</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cut open your cooked potatoes and crisscross the interiors, applying a teaspoon of the butter mix to each side of that split. Sit the spuds on the grill for three to four minutes, while it sinks in. Serve with the remaining butter, says Amedi: “Allow your guests to choose how much to add. Hint: a lot.”</p> <h2>Courgettes</h2> <p>Acme Fire Cult’s co-owner Daniel Watkins loves dense trombetta courgettes, which “lend themselves well to live flames”. He also works with sweet, seedless grezzina courgettes a lot, but the principle for all courgettes is the same: salt and oil the skin and turn regularly until they soften.</p> <p>Watkins likes to serve trombetta on a chickpea puree with creme fraiche, dressed in an Indian spiced butter sauce (madras curry powder or your preferred mix, simply cooked in butter).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9ec4d3e225d9eb9a33bb095d964fa5b1c478637\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ec4d3e225d9eb9a33bb095d964fa5b1c478637/332_0_4980_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Trombetta courgettes lend themselves well to live flames.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Trombetta courgettes lend themselves well to live flames.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Schiefelbein/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chef Sam Grainger, the food director at Liverpool’s Belzan and Madre restaurants, lets courgettes sit for a few moments in his universal summer anchovy dressing [see below]. Meanwhile, using a sieve, toast (to serve four people) 120g walnuts and crush them as they cool. On each plate, place two halves of a courgette, topped with walnuts, 50g crumbled feta and the remaining dressing.</p> <h2>Onions</h2> <p>Shaun Hurrell, the chef-owner of Durham’s <a href=\"https://www.barriocomida.com/\">Barrio Comida</a>, is a fan of “burn-and-peel”. Take any layered vegetable – leek, cabbage, fennel or onion – bury it in hot embers “to form a heavily charred exterior” (smaller items 10 to 15 minutes; larger 30 minutes), take out, wrap in foil “and allow them to steam in their juices until cool enough to handle. Peel back the charred layers and you’ll have a delicately steamed vegetable with a light smoke perfume.” Dress in good olive oil and vinegar or, if using fennel, harissa and natural yoghurt.</p> <p>Selin Kiazim, a chef at London’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/20/oklava-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Oklava</a>, intensifies onions’ natural sweetness in a similarly direct way. Quarter and skewer four, then cook over white coals to “colour quickly. Too low a heat and they shrivel before caramelising. They don’t need oil; just grill until blackened on one side and flip [four to five minutes each side]. I like them with some bite.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf376d8105fa99701396e88e9d374478df4f72fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf376d8105fa99701396e88e9d374478df4f72fe/0_177_5484_3292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Onions can be skewered and cooked over coals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Onions can be skewered and cooked over coals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elisa Sferrazza/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To serve four people as a sharing side, spread the onion petals out and season with salt. Whisk together 45ml pomegranate molasses, 15ml red wine vinegar, 75ml extra-virgin olive oil and 60ml Şalgam (fermented Turkish turnip or carrot juice, optional), and generously dress the onions. Scatter over a big handful of parsley and a dusting of sumac.</p> <h2>Beetroot</h2> <p>Barbecuing smaller beets is a cinch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/21/ollie-templeton-chef-interview-kitchen-encounters\">Ollie Templeton</a>, the chef-director at London’s <a href=\"https://carousel-london.com/\">Carousel</a>, tosses a variety of different coloured beets in salt, cider vinegar, olive oil and splash of elderflower cordial to build in subtle layers of flavour, then foil-wraps them and shoves them into the coals for 45 to 60 minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef98ce0d00edc7fcde54edac85bc77cb27d738be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef98ce0d00edc7fcde54edac85bc77cb27d738be/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beetroot at Carousel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beetroot at Carousel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleksandra Boruch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After cooling, they should pop out of their charred skins “tender, like boiled new potatoes”. Templeton serves his beets (one per person) quartered, on a bed of yoghurt seasoned with salt, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice.</p> <p>Add grilled red onions, sliced and dressed with apple vinegar, elderflower cordial and salt, and scatter with crispy fried capers and fresh herbs: “Dill, mint or parsley work well.”</p> <h2>Sam Grainger’s barbecue tips</h2> <p>To give it a smoke-friendly flavour boost, Grainger spritzes barbecuing veg with a mix of 50ml instant dashi powder (“brilliant stuff”), 25ml olive oil, 20ml white wine vinegar and 5ml lemon juice. That spritz works particularly well when over “super-high heat”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e179e717b00ef4840b19a0c1ab347ebfc062e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e179e717b00ef4840b19a0c1ab347ebfc062e92/0_171_5122_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A huge range of vegetables can be cooked on the barbecue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A huge range of vegetables can be cooked on the barbecue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lew Robertson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not only large, whole vegetables that can be barbecued. You can use an old metal sieve to cook small or sliced vegetables on a barbecue (peas, mangetout, broccoli, courgette, asparagus): “Essentially, stir-frying over fire.”</p> <p>For barbecues, Grainger routinely whips up a universal summer anchovy dressing. Blitz 2 banana shallots, the zest and juice of 3 lemons, a small bunch of parsley, thyme from 8 sprigs (pick the leaves off the woody stalks), 3 cloves of garlic, 8 salted anchovies, 3 tbsp white wine vinegar and 1 tbsp of honey with 100ml of hazelnut or olive oil. This will dress food for four to eight people and will put a spring in the step of any barbecued vegetable. Raw garlic in oil can be a botulism hazard, so make fresh batches of the anchovy dressing as you are cooking, and use immediately.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/04/hey-thats-my-house-us-aid-worker-realises-zawahiri-villa-is-his-old-home","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T08:51:54Z","webTitle":"Hey, that’s my house: US aid worker realises Zawahiri villa is his old home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/hey-thats-my-house-us-aid-worker-realises-zawahiri-villa-is-his-old-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/04/hey-thats-my-house-us-aid-worker-realises-zawahiri-villa-is-his-old-home","fields":{"headline":"Hey, that’s my house: US aid worker realises Zawahiri villa is his old home","trailText":"The Kabul property hit by a US drone was familiar.

It used to be his – when he worked in Afghanistan on a US government aid project – and the views were spectacular.</p> <p>Smock enjoyed starting the day looking out at the Afghan capital, as did the world’s most wanted terrorist, from the villa they both called home, several years apart.</p> <p>“Reports said the CIA had intelligence that he liked to stand on the balcony, and I thought, ‘Of course he would, it was a nice balcony,’” Smock said in a phone interview.</p> <p>“When the Kabul smog lifts you can see the mountains in the morning, and it’s next to an open field,” he said. He put up bamboo matting as a privacy screen, which was still there when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/us-strike-afghanistan-kills-al-qaida-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri\">a US drone struck Ayman al-Zawahiri down</a>, so the terrace was not overlooked.</p> <p>“It felt like you could hang out there without anyone noticing who it is, unless someone was really paying attention.

He was a little surprised and disconcerted to see the windows smashed.</p> <p>“When I saw it I thought ‘that’s my old house’,” he said. “These villas are garish as all hell but unique and this one especially, it was built on such a narrow footprint.”</p> <p>Then, on Monday evening, the US president, Joe Biden, told Americans that the al-Qaida leader, Zawahiri, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/us-strike-afghanistan-kills-al-qaida-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri\">had been the target</a>.</p> <p>And Smock, a US military veteran of the war in Iraq, who also spent years working as a civilian in Afghanistan, realised he had lived in the same space as one of the men who plotted the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>“It’s an incredibly surreal thing. Things change, and things change quickly, but at that level? That’s a little intense. You’ve got public enemy number one, with a $25m bounty on his head, literally living in the same space you lived in previously,” he said.</p> <p>“I keep running through the reality of him being in the same rooms I was in.”</p> <p>The CIA created a detailed model of the house, US media reported, to help understand how a strike might affect the structure, and whether Zawahiri could be killed without harming others.</p> <p>The reason the area appealed to US government contractors is probably the same reason it was seen as a good place to host the al-Qaida leader. It is essentially a quiet, closed-off neighbourhood near the seat of power.</p> <p>“Down by the [Ghazanfar] bank and Spinneys [supermarket], there are two entrances on either side. If you control those you control the whole neighbourhood,” said Smock.</p> <p>He described a tall, relatively narrow house, set back from the security wall behind a paved garden area lined with shrubs. The main doors opened on to a staircase that ran up through the centre of the house, with strange acoustics.</p> <p>“If you said anything on the ground floor it echoed up all the floors. It was like living in a speaker box, even if you were not speaking loudly.” Smock moved in with about half a dozen colleagues – for security reasons foreigners took jobs without families and were regularly put up in shared houses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time there was a kitchen on the ground floor, three bedrooms on the higher floors and on the top a small apartment space, with a living room and en suite bathroom.

The LGBTQ+ inclusivity of the sport, and the golden age of the women’s game pre-ban, are also highlighted – in particular, with the legacy of Lily Parr and the team she played for: Dick, Kerr Ladies – while its four hosts are adept at balancing the informative with the engaging.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/goal-diggers-podcast/id1452130891\">Goal Diggers Podcast</a></strong></p> <p>A black, female-led podcast by a group of fans who know their football, from transfer predictions to match round-ups: this show is refreshing, funny and smart.

They developed sexual relationships with their targets as part of their cover, in some cases fathering children. This story was brought to public attention by the unmasking and subsequent disclosures of the former undercover officer Mark Kennedy. It was also exposed in the Guardian by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans\" title=\"\">Rob Evans and Paul Lewis</a>, whose landmark work, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/29/undercover-secret-police-lewis-evans-review\" title=\"\">Undercover,</a> is credited as the source material for Trespass.</p> <p>Clark’s novel is a harrowing and compelling act of excavation. It feels almost like a moral necessity to read it, and through doing so bear witness to something that wasn’t just perpetrated by the police against political activists. It was done in the name of the people whose taxes fund the state and whose votes decide its direction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trespass tells the story of Tess, a former environmental activist, and Mia, the daughter she had with another activist who became violent and unstable during Tess’s pregnancy and then disappeared shortly before Mia was born. When a death in the family brings to light the appalling truth that this man, whom Tess knew as Dave, had in fact stolen the identity of a dead child and was not who he claimed to be, a grimly inevitable unravelling ensues. It becomes clear to Tess that the man she loved must have been an undercover officer. She sets out to reach back into her past and understand who this man really was, at the same time as Mia, now aged 12, begins her own search to understand the story of her father.</p> <p>The novel is most successful in dramatising the relationship between Tess and Mia. Theirs is a mother-daughter bond put under intense pressure by the ghosts of the past, and by the fact that, as an attempt to protect her daughter from the shame of abandonment, Tess has told Mia her father died. These lies, piled on top of each other, exert an extraordinary pressure on the excellently written character of Mia. Clark rises to the challenge of imagining what a story like this would do to a child; the emotional violence visited on Mia simply by the facts of her birth.</p> <p>There is much else to praise in Trespass. The greatest outrage expressed by society when this news story broke was over the surveillance of people like Tess: white middle-class activists whose main concern was road-building. This book deftly shows how the same unchecked surveillance had been visited on many other social groups. Clark threads the low-level monitoring of a Muslim youth group into the story, and we glimpse how very far the tentacles of the state spread.</p> <p>She also illustrates that whatever is done by the state is likely to be done to an even greater extent in the private sector, bringing corporate espionage into the narrative. After leaving the police, Dave finds an espionage network that is openly for hire, unchecked and motivated only by the profit principle. Finally, Clark asks us to consider the way surveillance, which seems so appalling when done in person, has become a part of all our lives. Mia’s life, in particular, is dominated by her phone, and the buzz of her texts becomes part of her father’s violence against her.</p> <p>At the heart of the narrative, though, is one significant failure. It may well be intentional. Clark interleaves three voices to tell her story – those of Tess, Mia and Dave. She signally fails to explain or humanise the last of these: as the novel proceeds he becomes steadily more monstrous, until his behaviour is almost unbearable to read about. It may be Clark’s contention that such men are simply monsters. However, the value of extending Evans and Lewis’s work into fiction is surely the opportunity to go deeper into the lives and motivations of all the people caught up in these atrocities.<em> </em>Trespass does not fully pursue this. Having met Mark Kennedy once while he was still undercover, and been haunted by that meeting ever since, I could not help but wish it had.</p> <p><em>• </em>Trespass by Clare Clark is published by Virago (£16.99).

In the play, the young jurors debate whether they can safely open a window because it’s so hot and polluted outside. Rehearsals started on the day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/15/met-office-issues-extreme-heat-warning-for-england-next-week\">the UK Met Office issued its first ever red warning for extreme heat</a>. On the afternoon I visit, wildfires are tearing into California yet again, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/fire-rips-through-park-on-czech-german-border-dozens-evacuated\">hundreds in Germany and the Czech Republic are being evacuated</a>. Extreme though the scenario is, The Trials is hardly science fiction. “Look around,” King says with a shrug. “In some places we’re already there.”</p> <p>In one scene I watch being rehearsed, the jurors fantasise what it might be like to fly in a plane, a mode of transport that has essentially been banned. Flinging together tables and chairs in the jury room to mock up an aircraft cabin, they rhapsodise about escaping the horrors at ground level – flooding, food shortages, refugee crises – and soaring into the “blue blue sky” as their parents and grandparents once did. An ice-cold Coke and a bag of in-flight peanuts are impossible-to-imagine luxuries.</p> <p>In another scene, somehow even sadder, they speculate what it might be like to encounter snow. The idea of jetting off on a skiing holiday is brain-boggling. “I’ve seen video, but …” one of them says.</p> <p>King’s decision to employ a group of teens (the youngest is 12, the oldest 18) gives the piece an appealingly lopsided energy. Yes, these kids are reckoning with the consequences of the climate crisis, but they also want to flirt, kiss, mess around – just live their lives. While the Donmar has hired some seasoned pros – Joe Locke and William Gao, both stars of <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81059939\">the Netflix series Heartstopper</a>, appear – a number of the cast were found via the theatre’s “Local” scheme, <a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/discover/donmar-local/\">which brings in schools and community groups</a> from nearby boroughs. Nearly 1,400 young people were involved, some 200 of whom participated in intensive workshops at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2b3278d139729f1f4a5d74556554155a7b781b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2b3278d139729f1f4a5d74556554155a7b781b0/543_994_5010_3006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Writer Dawn King and director Natalie Abrahami in rehearsals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Writer Dawn King and director Natalie Abrahami in rehearsals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This felt important to do, explains director Natalie Abrahami: “The theme of the play seemed to call for it, somehow. This sense of activism, engagement.”</p> <p>What attracted Locke, now 18, to the project? It transpires that he first read the script on a plane on the way to an acting job. He pulls a face. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’m both the generation that should be making the change, but I’m also here, pumping out carbon,” he says.</p> <p>Does he share the characters’ anger about who’s responsible? “I don’t necessarily think it’s anger towards an individual generation,” he replies carefully. “It’s more like feeling disenfranchised. It makes a lot of young people want to get involved in changing things.”</p> <p>Francis Dourado, 15, who’s been fitting rehearsals around his GCSEs, is less diplomatic. “In the future, those people in power [now], they’re not going to be there any more,” he says quietly. “We’ll be the ones left with a world that’s already dying. It might already be too late to save it. I hope it’s not, but …”</p> <p>King has form when it comes to putting dystopias on stage. Her breakout play was 2011’s Foxfinder, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/05/foxfinder-review\">captivated critics with its eerie portrayal of a rural community</a> in which foxes are blamed for everything from bad harvests to contagion, like 17th-century witches, and must at all costs be rooted out. Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/09/brave-new-world-review-james-dacre\">incisive 2015 adaptation of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World</a> was followed by a collaboration with grime MC and rapper Skepta, <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/skepta-dystopia987/\">Dystopia987</a>, which attempted to present what the club scene of the future might look like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18ea3ff793b2862e5b27a2d94751039f2438d108\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18ea3ff793b2862e5b27a2d94751039f2438d108/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Becci Gemmell and Kirsty Besterman in Foxfinder by Dawn King at the Finborough, London, in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Becci Gemmell and Kirsty Besterman in Foxfinder by Dawn King at the Finborough, London, in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Partly it’s coincidental, she laughs: write one successful dystopia and producers think that’s all you can do. “But the thing I’d say is that right now we’re living in a dystopia. We’ve just been in a 40C heatwave, wildfires aren’t just in Europe, but in Kent. How much more dystopian do you want to get?”</p> <p>Courtroom dramas are nothing new, but when a German version of the play debuted in Düsseldorf last summer, <a href=\"https://www.ddorf-aktuell.de/2022/01/16/weg-mit-den-alten-das-tribunal-am-schauspielhaus-duesseldorf/\">some critics raised eyebrows</a> at the way the script pits the generations against one another, with teenagers called upon to denounce people of their parents’ age in ways that seem uncomfortably reminiscent of the Chinese Cultural Revolution or the US’s McCarthyite witch-hunts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/07/sustainable-theatre-green-agenda-national-theatre-drama\">How do you make a lavish spectacle sustainable?

Abrahami replies that The Trials is intended to provoke debate, and hopefully action. “The play is one act, with no interval; the second half is the conversation that you have with whoever you came to see the show with. How does it change the way you think? What do you want to change in your own life?”</p> <p>King says that she’s as much on trial here as anyone else. “It’s not me pointing the finger at other people, definitely not.” She holds up her hands. “From this point on, people will always say to me, ‘Oh, did you fly? Did you not take the train?’ I’m putting myself up here.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.climatechangetheatreaction.com/about/#:~:text=Founded%20in%202015%2C%20Climate%20Change,the%20United%20Nations%20COP%20meetings.\">Despite many attempts</a>, theatre has often struggled to communicate the immensity of the climate crisis or map out ways to solve it.

These young people are living in a world where the climate emergency is being taken massively seriously. We need to listen to that.” Locke agrees: “The play shows what the future could be, not what it will be. That’s an important distinction to make.”</p> <p>When I ask if he thinks people will really change the way they live, Dourado looks grave, seeming much older than his years. “I think they will change because now more than ever, we see everything happening so fast around us. A lot of people are starting to wake up and realise.” How about Locke? “You have to stay optimistic because otherwise you can’t change anything.”</p> <p>Abrahami is nodding. “I’m sort of a hopeaholic,” she says with a smile. “You have to be, don’t you?”</p> <p>• The Trials is at the <a href=\"https://booking.donmarwarehouse.com/events/8201APNKPTCPSVLMMRDKJCTKBHRDCGHGR?_ga=2.13512244.22625962.1659531022-2136796629.1659531022\">Donmar Warehouse, London</a>, 12–27 August.

He moved with the team from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958<strong> </strong>and spent nearly seven decades inviting viewers and listeners to join him<strong>.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/vin-scully-dead-obituary-kos-angeles-dodgers\">Vin Scully, Los Angeles Dodgers broadcaster for 67 years, dies aged 94</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His solitary presence in the booth turned broadcasts into fireside chats with millions of Angelenos and fans outside of greater Los Angeles who could find a feed of a Dodger game. Bob Costas called Scully the greatest baseball announcer that ever lived. Current Dodgers announcer Joe Davis said he was “as great of a storyteller as there has been in modern history”. In November 2016, US president Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Obama recalled that Scully asked whether he was deserving of such an honor, saying that “I’m just an old baseball announcer.”</p> <p>Obama looked to the audience and then to Scully. “We had to inform him that to Americans of all ages, you are an old friend.”</p> <p>A child of New York City, Scully was captivated by radio broadcasts of college football games and the roar of the crowd that crackled through AM radio. After graduating from Fordham University in the Bronx, Scully’s first professional assignment was a college football game between Maryland and Boston University at Fenway Park. There were no seats in the press box, so he called the game from the stadium roof. A year later, he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and traveled west when the team moved to Los Angeles.</p> <p>Just as Scully found his calling with an ear to airwaves, generations of children wanted to be sportscasters because of him. Anytime between the dawn of spring and the dusk of summer, Scully regaled his audiences with his lifetime of stories while narrating the drama of Major League Baseball. West coast fans remembered Scully narrating easy summer nights and backyard barbecues, east coast fans remember him as the last voice they heard <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emmabaccellieri/status/1554671096909144066\">before drifting to sleep</a>.</p> <p>When faced with the most dramatic moments of his career, Scully brought viewers closer to history with restraint and simplicity. After announcing Hank Aaron’s home run to pass Babe Ruth as Major League Baseball’s all-time home run leader, Scully let 27 seconds pass, leaving viewers only with the visual of Aaron rounding the bases, the partying of a boisterous crowd and the thunder of celebratory fireworks. Once Aaron was greeted by his teammates, Scully resumed his narration.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjqYThEVoSQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QjqYThEVoSQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Vin Scully’s call of Hank Aaron’s record-breaking 715th home run.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>“What a marvelous moment for baseball. What a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia. What a marvelous moment for the country and the world,” Scully said. “A Black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron.”</p> <p>After his historic “behind the bag! It gets through Buckner!” call in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llHnR0ZPy6E\">Game 6 of the 1986 World Series</a>, Scully lets the raucous New York Mets crowd carry the broadcast for over three minutes before telling viewers that “if one picture is worth 1,000 words, you’ve seen about a million words.”</p> <p>Fans of the Dodgers can pick between any number of his legendary calls: When Sandy Koufax threw his perfect game in 1965, striking out the last six batters in the process, Scully stated that “when Koufax wrote his name in capital letters in the record books, that K stands out even more than the O-U-F-A-X.” When hobbled Dodgers slugger Kirk Gibson hit a home run to win Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, Scully graced the call with “in a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened!”</p> <p>Scully announced three perfect games and 25 World Series over 67 years of handling play-by-play duties for the Dodgers. His extemporaneous brilliance shined during the most dramatic moments, but it was his daily company that endeared himself to viewers, listeners and the coaches and ballplayers that he covered. He eschewed homerism in favor of personal stories and history lessons. His languid narration complemented baseball’s methodical pace so viewers could learn about Hatshepsut, Alexander the Great and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg5idK9bE_k\">history of beards</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJmDQD3ziYk\">conquests of seafaring pirates</a>, or the time a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZtO_ZVM9s\">player extracted two baby jackrabbits from the innards of a rattlesnake</a>. Every story had a moral, and none of them came at the expense of what was happening on the field.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To the wartime generation, he was an old friend; to the baby boomers, he was a father figure; to the rest of us, he was a grandparent reading bedtime stories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Scully preferred subtlety to bombast and colored his broadcasts with a gentle sense of humor that never mocked his subjects. During one Dodgers broadcast on April 20, he noted that it was Adolf Hitler’s birthday <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/la-dodgers-tweets/vin-scully-on-hitler\">before spitting into the microphone twice</a>. When narrating an ejection, he’d explain to the audience that the seething player or manager thought the umpire’s call was “blinking fertilizer.” Once, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiUPlTRUY_Y\">he even read a fan’s grocery list</a>.</p> <p>In a 1981 golf tournament, he invited viewers to “pull up a chair and take a look at the agony of a gentleman who is caught in the pot hole at 14” as golfer Rik Massengale attempts seven shots to escape a cavernous bunker. Almost two minutes later, during which Scully invokes poetry and imagines the<em><strong> </strong></em>internal monologues of Massengale and his caddy, Scully described the golfer as “a casualty of what looks like a meteorite that landed just to the left of the green on 14”. If the on-field action slowed, Scully offered listeners everything from one-man shows to history lessons to keep the broadcast moving.</p> <p>His zest for storytelling only grew as he entered the twilight of his career that spanned seven decades. With the help of a devoted research team that he’d frequently extoll during broadcasts, weekday evenings and weekend afternoons with Scully were joyous treks through personal histories and old textbooks. To the wartime generation, he was an old friend; to the baby boomers, he was a father figure; to the rest of us, he was a grandparent reading bedtime stories. No matter their age, every listener was rapt when Scully spoke.</p> <p>It took him just four minutes to tell the history of Friday the 13th – Tuesday the 13th is considered unlucky in Mexico and Greece while Friday the 17th is bad luck in Italy. It is then that second baseman Mark Ellis approaches the plate. “Luckily he wears No 14,” Scully says. “I’m not trying to get smart, I just figured you folks would find it a little interesting. Like you, I’d be lost without Google.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86ff1b02718995d6cce0593417ce26dd727dd9af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86ff1b02718995d6cce0593417ce26dd727dd9af/0_0_3614_2422/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vin Scully\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vin Scully at Dodger Stadium, 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Dodgers faced Pittsburgh pitcher Arquimedes Caminero, Scully <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VinScullyTweet/status/645089887641702401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E645089887641702401%7Ctwgr%5Ecca4eafb6b00bae6ca7d6955c7f67c60fc0a4f3a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportingnews.com%2Fus%2Fmlb%2Fnews%2Fdodgers-vin-scully-archimedes-caminero-pirates-mlb-playoffs%2F1ixfkabq82m301qeia80yrlft5\">explained the science of Archimedes Principle</a> and his youthful struggles with geometry in under 30 seconds. During an at-bat by Arizona outfielder Socrates Brito, Scully summarized the death of Greek philosopher Socrates in just over two minutes. Did you know that Socrates could have escaped his captors, but elected to stand trial so long as he was given a free nightly dinner? You may know that Socrates died after drinking hemlock, but did you know that hemlock was a member of the parsley family?</p> <p>“It was the juice of that little flower that took Socrates away,” Scully said right as Brito swung and missed for strike three. “A bad outside pitch is chased by Socrates. And down he goes!”</p> <p>Maybe the most magical part of Scully’s personality and career was his exuberance for the fans who filled the stadium and tuned in to enjoy his broadcasts. Whenever the cameras focused on children, Scully would dote on them as if they were his grandkids. When the cameras caught a toddler sucking her right thumb during a September 2016 broadcast, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alliemackay/status/778454233901248512\">he recited Shel Silverstein’s ‘Thumbs’</a> before the first pitch of the inning.</p> <p>Even in death, it was Scully’s zest for life that motivated so many touching tributes when news of his death broke on Tuesday. He was a few months shy of his 90th birthday when he said “no matter how many tomorrows I have, I’m spending the todays exactly the way I wanted to.” When a reporter asked what he did on his first opening day as a retiree, Scully said he was engaged in the other national pastime: paying bills.</p> <p>When he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VinScullyTweet/status/782706837544050688\">signed off for good in October 2016</a>, Scully looked into the camera and said that “we’ve been friends for a long time, but I know in my heart that I’ve needed you more than you’ve ever needed me and I’ll miss our time together more than I can say.” As Scully ascends into the sky, one he might describe as “cotton candy pink with a canopy of blue, good enough to eat”, the world misses Scully more than it ever has before: gone is a paragon of joy in a world of anger and calm in a time of chaos.</p> <p>Everybody knew that Scully would shine under the brightest lights and highest drama, but he is missed because invited us to join him after our best day or our worst, in times of joy or in times of grief. And for a few hours, Vin comforted us from the pleasant confines of the press box, a needed respite from life’s everyday stresses.</p> <p>And every night, he’d invite us to join him again the next day when it was time for Dodger baseball.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/04/mypillow-mike-lindell-trump-big-lie-election-fraud","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"MyPillow chief spends tens of millions in fresh crusade to push Trump’s big lie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/mypillow-mike-lindell-trump-big-lie-election-fraud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/mypillow-mike-lindell-trump-big-lie-election-fraud","fields":{"headline":"MyPillow chief spends tens of millions in fresh crusade to push Trump’s big lie","trailText":"Mike Lindell says he has poured up to $40m into wave of lawsuits and a new movie as US experts warn of threat to democracy","byline":"Peter Stone in Washington","body":"<p>The MyPillow chief executive, Mike Lindell, a fervent Donald Trump ally, says he has poured $35-40m into a wide crusade – a wave of lawsuits to get rid of voting machines that he faults for Trump’s defeat, a new movie about voting fraud, and a hefty legal stable – to promote charges that the 2020 election was riddled with fraud, despite a flood of contrary evidence.</p> <p>In his frenetic quest to dispense with electronic voting equipment that he has often charged is defective, Lindell is hosting a two-day “Moment of Truth” summit on 20 and 21 August in Missouri, that he expects will draw 200 federal and state officials and staff, as well as hundreds of representatives from groups nationwide who have investigated alleged election fraud this year and in 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/08/trump-clark-giuliani-eastman-lawyers-plot-overturn-election\">Trump lawyers feel heat as legal net tightens on plot to overturn election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a related front to boost his cause, a small segment of the summit will feature 10 conservative sheriffs who have become increasingly active in fighting purported election fraud, who Lindell told the Guardian he invited so they would have “a platform to get their voices heard”.</p> <p>One leading voice is slated to be the former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack, who runs the rightwing Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA). The organization hosted a July meeting in Las Vegas that Lindell attended and publicized via a TV operation he owns, and has taken the unorthodox step of making monitoring election fraud its top priority, which Mack has dubbed a “holy cause”.</p> <p>The upcoming Lindell summit underscores the growing roles of him and his allies in a sprawling network waging a multi-front war to push Trump’s “big lie” about the 2020 election, and mobilize activists to ramp up their scrutiny of the fall elections as poll workers and poll watchers. These moves could curb voting rights and intimidate voters, say election watchdogs.</p> <p>The “big lie” network has been bolstered by other multimillionaires including Patrick Byrne, the former chief executive of Overstock, and at least $1m from a Donald Trump political action committee.</p> <p>Byrne co-founded the America Project with retired army Lt Gen Michael Flynn just a few months after they attended a meeting with Trump in December 2020, where wild schemes to overturn Joe Biden’s win were discussed. He has boasted of pouring $3m into a self -styled “election integrity” drive to hunt for potential fraud by training activists in poll watching and canvassing.</p> <p>Non-partisan election spending analysts warn of threats to democracy in the new voting blitzes that mega-donors who promote Trump’s “big lie” are underwriting.</p> <p>“Mega-donor spending, long associated with Super Pacs and non-profits, is now also aimed at shaping even how our elections are administered,” said Sheila Krumholz, who leads OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign money. “Election administration is critical infrastructure in a democracy and should not be determined by partisan power-brokers.”</p> <p>However, the burgeoning “big lie” ecosystem seems to have other priorities: it includes non-profits such as the Texas-based True the Vote, which co-sponsored the CSPOA Las Vegas summit in July, and has teamed up with another sheriffs’ group, Protect America Now, run by the Arizona sheriff Mark Lamb, to form an alliance to police this year’s voting for fraud.</p> <p>Another influential activist with strong fundraising ties on the right is Cleta Mitchell, a former Trump campaign lawyer who has spearheaded numerous “election integrity” summits in key swing states and is a leading figure at the Conservative Partnership Institute, to which Trump’s leadership Pac last year gave $1m.</p> <p>Mitchell participated in Trump’s infamous call on 2 January 2021 with the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump urged him to “find” 11,870 votes to block Biden’s win there. Mitchell was subpoenaed last month by a special grand jury in Georgia investigating whether Trump’s call and other related efforts broke state laws.</p> <p>The “big lie” advocates have spent tens of millions of dollars pushing baseless claims of widespread election fraud in 2020 as they have built an infrastructure of loyalists in swing states to be poll watchers and poll workers, and helped enact new laws in 18 states since 2021 that include new limits on absentee voting and other measures to make voting more difficult.</p> <p>Despite powerful evidence presented to the House panel investigating the January 6 Capitol attack, including former attorney general Bill Barr’s comments that he told Trump there was no evidence of significant fraud in 2020, and numerous studies showing that voting fraud is historically small, the pro-Trump network seems to be growing.</p> <p>“It is troubling to see conspiracy theorists investing money in a network designed to spread their lies about the 2020 election,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, the acting director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “They are using those conspiracies in an attempt to cause real harm to voters, and to our democracy. In the search for non-existent fraud, they are turning American citizens against their neighbors, who seek only to exercise their fundamental right to vote.”</p> <p>Morales-Doyle added: “Now, it seems that election deniers have begun recruiting law enforcement to their cause. At a time when both voters and election workers have cause to fear intimidation and harassment, it is shameful that law enforcement officers would compound that fear rather than offering them protection.”</p> <p>Some sheriffs too are troubled by law enforcement officials getting involved in elections.</p> <p>“There’s no place for politics in policing,” Paul Penzone, the sheriff of Arizona’s Maricopa county, told the Guardian. “We are seeing a radical movement, including some local law enforcement, of people who are committed to destroying trust in our system for their own selfish gain.</p> <p>“We must fight against it, or our nation will no longer be the democratic standard.”</p> <p>Critics notwithstanding, “big lie” advocacy looks to be broadening.</p> <p>For instance, Lindell’s efforts to wage war on alleged voting fraud have expanded in recent months as he has financed lawsuits to ditch voting machines in numerous states including Arizona, which Biden won. He also plowed about $1m into a new film on voting fraud by the former Fox News reporter Lara Logan, which is slated to debut at his summit.</p> <p>Lindell predicts the film will have a “huge” impact. Logan, who was ousted from Fox after making an incendiary comparison between Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the president, and the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, told Lindell she could “[not] find any place where there wasn’t fraud”.</p> <p>The summit, which will be broadcast on Lindell TV and streamed on Lindell’s FrankSpeech.com, is also scheduled to include several of the lawyers Lindell has tapped for his litigation, plus a team of cyber specialists who have done research on election fraud, Lindell said.</p> <p>The upcoming summit seems to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/mike-lindell-trump-election-big-lie\">underscore other ties</a> that Lindell has been forging with Mack, the former sheriff, and his association. Mack’s Las Vegas meeting was livestreamed on Lindell’s eponymous Lindell TV, and Lindell interviewed Mack, a former board member of the far-right Oath Keepers, on his own show, The Lindell Report, on 13 July. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwUabMU_0aU&amp;feature=emb_title\">Lindell and Mack</a> also held a joint press event in Las Vegas where they touted how sheriffs could play key roles in fighting alleged voting fraud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c70444f5d8acee1276062a5f66eda0b5aa64a91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c70444f5d8acee1276062a5f66eda0b5aa64a91/0_82_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Mack, the founder of CSPOA, at the Las Vegas summit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Mack, the founder of CSPOA, at the Las Vegas summit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridget Bennett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mack’s Las Vegas event also garnered more exposure due to True the Vote’s co-sponsoring, a move that reflects the Texas group’s aggressive drive to mobilize sheriffs to monitor elections.</p> <p>True the Vote’s recent launch of ProtectAmerica.Vote, in tandem with Lamb, the Arizona sheriff, highlights a burgeoning alliance between the group and some sheriffs.</p> <p>The website for ProtectAmerica.Vote offers a sweeping mission statement that includes efforts to “empower sheriffs” and “connect citizens and sheriffs” as part of a wide-ranging drive to ferret out potential voting fraud.</p> <p>Other drives to promote Trump’s big lie have witnessed more fundraising and alliances to help beef up voting scrutiny for the fall elections.</p> <p>Mitchell’s summits, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/30/republican-recruit-poll-workers-election-integrity\">have benefited</a> from strong links to well-heeled conservative groups who have been co-sponsors, including Tea Party Patriots Action and FreedomWorks. As senior legal fellow at CPI, Mitchell has led the summits in swing states such as Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and boasted of creating a “movement” to fight alleged voting fraud by recruiting poll watchers and poll workers.</p> <p>To that end, Mitchell and CPI have helped set up local and state taskforces, and supplied a 19-page “Citizens’ Guide to Building an Election Integrity Infrastructure”. The CPI manual suggests traditional poll monitoring methods, plus, ominously, urging its activists to be “ever-present” inside election offices and to follow “every step” of vote-by-mail operations.</p> <p>Further, CPI has witnessed a big jump in its overall revenues, which benefit a variety of the group’s conservative programs, including its election integrity initiative, since last year, when it recruited Mitchell and Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows as senior partner. Founded by the former South Carolina senator Jim DeMint in 2017, CPI raked in $19.7m in 2021, up from $7.3m in 2020, according to its latest annual report.</p> <p>Besides hauling in $1m from Trump’s leadership Pac, the group seems to have gotten a boost from a letter Trump wrote, praising its role “helping to build out the vital infrastructure we need to lead the America First movement to new heights”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, when Byrne unveiled the America Project’s “election integrity” drive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/07/sham-fears-over-trump-loyalists-election-integrity-drive\">dubbed Operation Eagles Wings</a>, that he ponied up $3m to launch this year, he named Flynn and longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone as special advisers. The move set off alarm bells with voting watchdogs such as Morales-Doyle, who deemed it a “sham”, in part because of the duo’s ties to several Oath Keepers and Proud Boys charged in the Capitol attack.</p> <p>Byrne, like Stone and Flynn, is known for conspiratorial and debunked efforts to prove the 2020 election was rigged. With Operation Eagles Wings he has boasted of plans to educate “election reform activists” to handle election canvassing, grassroots work and fundraising “to expose shenanigans at the ballot box.”</p> <p>Byrne has described the operation’s mission as ensuring “there are no repeats of the errors that happened in the 2020 election”, and stressed the “need to protect the voting process from election meddlers who care only about serving crooked special-interest groups that neither respect nor value the rule of law”.</p> <p>Looking ahead, Morales-Doyle stressed that the Trump-allied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/07/sham-fears-over-trump-loyalists-election-integrity-drive\">election denialist movement </a>poses multiple threats to democracy.</p> <p>“The ramifications of the lie that the 2020 election was rigged reach far beyond the events of January 6. This lie has fueled a variety of new threats to our democracy, including changes to state law, harassment of election workers, and the recruitment of poll watchers, poll workers and vigilante canvassers.”</p> <p>Still, he added: “We must keep in mind that our democracy is resilient, and that there are federal and state laws in place to protect voters and others from those that seek to undermine it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/04/white-working-class-fiction-tories-obsessed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"The phrase ‘white working class’ is a fiction – so why are the Tories obsessed with it? | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/white-working-class-fiction-tories-obsessed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/white-working-class-fiction-tories-obsessed","fields":{"headline":"The phrase ‘white working class’ is a fiction – so why are the Tories obsessed with it?","trailText":"Why is the right so obsessed with peddling the fake narrative that it’s white people who have been left behind, says Guardian columnist Zoe Williams","byline":"Zoe Williams","body":"<p>The “white working class” is such a peculiar phrase, so widely deployed and so misleading. Of course there are white people who are working class, but the class as a whole is the most diverse of any group. This is a point made by <a href=\"http://classonline.org.uk/pubs/item/they-look-down-on-us\">a report from Class</a>, the union-funded thinktank, on new attitudes to race and class in Britain. You cannot predefine the beliefs and values of a class, it says, and then filter for people whose<strong> </strong>whose views correspond to them. Instead, the researchers built their sample on a points system, taking into consideration class identity, housing tenure, education level, occupation, household income, and if and how one might pay a £500 emergency bill. Perhaps that sounds obvious, but it is also quite a novel approach.</p> <p>Certain things stand out immediately: the “uberisation” of certain sectors such as academia, coupled with general pay stagnation and a public sector pay freeze, have combined to mean that old blue collar/white collar distinctions are no longer meaningful. You can have what used to be called a “middle-class job” and still struggle to meet your basic needs.</p> <p>What hasn’t changed is that the working class is diverse. Indeed, this is a core definition; monoculturalism is a phenomenon mainly of upper-class groups. The values and attitudes associated with the “white working class” or its sibling phrase, so-called “red wall” voters – patriotism, xenophobia, racism, nativism, traditionalism, nostalgia – are simply not discernible themes in any prolonged discussion with working-class people. They are unlikely (29%) to think that people of colour who cannot get ahead have problems of their own making, while 54% think that talking about race and racism is necessary to move towards an equal society.</p> <p>What does unify this group is its work ethic and its precariousness – and alliedto this, a belief that the system is rigged against people who have to work to live. Whoever is buying the line that the wealthy accrued their fortunes with graft, it is not the working-class people in this study, who overwhelmingly (70% ) think that the rich have simply been handed better opportunities.</p> <p>The Conservatives and their supportive media are pitching to a sub-set of a sub-set, their own members, and their talking points are extremely niche: anti-green, anti-trans, anti-human-rights, pro-grammar schools, a fierce if loosely gathered crusade against the present and the future. But their broader pitch over the past six years has been to this fabled “white working class”, the one true voter: prioritised because they were authentic, their authenticity proven by their anger, which was justified because they’d been left behind. They hated the EU, immigration, London and elites; they loved the NHS, the Queen and their country.</p> <p>The conception was unfalsifiable. All counter-evidence – other working-class people who were socially liberal, or valued immigration, or wanted to stay in the EU, or disapproved of the monarchy – was dismissed as coming from a false working class, either brainwashed by the elite, or a member of the elite in disguise. It was a completely deliberate mischaracterisation of the working class, and we could ruminate forever on who resisted it least effectively. Yet the cornerstone of its success was the insistence on whiteness as a distinct category.</p> <p>If the working class had been characterised as it is – the most diverse of all social classes – most of the other narratives wouldn’t have stood up.</p> <p>This frame – “while the elites have been chattering about multiculturalism, there’s been a hidden victimisation of the left-behind white Briton” – was originally a feature of education studies in the early 00s, where it was a legitimate inquiry based on the pupil attainment data with which the Labour government was obsessed. The educational failure of white working-class children, particularly boys, was seized on immediately as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/multiculturalism-diversity-political-policy\">material</a> for the “whither multiculturalism?” debate, which previously found its problem with racial equality hard to express.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/25/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-britain-class-tory-leadership\">What the absurd class cosplay of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss tells us about Britain | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The slippage from the specific and demonstrable (the educational failure of white working-class children) to the general and atmospheric (society’s broad failure of the entire white working class) has been incremental. There was just enough truth in it to make it stick. It kept a sharp focus on areas that had been “left behind”, and those were everywhere, particularly post-austerity as communities were deliberately hollowed out by cuts. The sense of democratic decline, what Class calls a “lack of power and voice” in working-class communities, was likewise rooted in fact – but the “red wall” narrative warped the roots, insisting that the working class went unheard by the liberal elite because their views were unpalatable to liberalism (being, in the main, too racist).</p> <p>Since the category itself – a non-diverse working class – was a fiction, it could never be meaningfully studied, and its views were instead ventriloquised by newspaper hunches and what politicians “heard on the doorstep”. It’s all been a giant confidence trick, to which the rebuttal is quite simple. If you want to talk about the working class, you need to say what it means, figure out who’s in it, and then ask them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Pasulka finds answers in the stories of Brooklyn’s charismatic queens","byline":"Alex Needham","body":"<p>On a Saturday afternoon in September 2018, I went to Bushwig, a drag festival in New York, where, over two days, 150 queens appeared in front of a highly enthusiastic and somewhat unhinged crowd – perhaps channelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/britneyspears\" title=\"\">Britney Spears</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q01yoGp9Dik\" title=\"\">2001 MTV awards</a>, someone even brought a live python on to the dancefloor. There was bawdy comedy and performance art so out there it was almost extraterrestrial. A dizzying variety of ages, genders and aesthetics were represented, with music ranging from heavy metal to diva classics. Bushwig confirmed that drag had become the pre-eminent performing art of the decade, and that Brooklyn was its spiritual home.</p> <p>Nicole Pasulka’s book How to Get Famous sets out to explain why that happened. While modern drag was born in prohibition-era Manhattan, as evidenced by dances like the Hamilton Lodge (also known as Faggots’) Ball where men would frolic dressed as showgirls, it took 80 years and a trip across the East River for drag to get supercharged by a new generation. These queens – mostly young, often people of colour – wanted to use drag not just as a means of performing a gender illusion, but in order to express their personal history, cultural and racial identity or penchant for gross-out humour. While the drag they performed was rough and messy, low down and dirty, they had artistic aspirations that were higher than just a flawless face or a super-convincing tuck – though if they could manage those as well, all to the good.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Fame as a drag queen entails heaving suitcases of costumes around the world while getting non-stop abuse on social media</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pasulka’s book follows a handful of Brooklyn queens from their first days jumping subway turnstiles in heels to their graduation as fully fledged drag stars, and what it meant to them personally and to the culture at large. The question of how drag queens actually did get famous, relatively speaking at least, leads inevitably to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/sep/21/fenton-bailey-randy-barbato-producers-rupauls-drag-race\" title=\"\">RuPaul’s Drag Race</a>. This gameshow, which started out in 2009 as a camp parody of Project Runway and America’s Next Top Model, is now an Emmy-winning cultural juggernaut that has been franchised around the world.</p> <p>The problem for the Brooklyn queens was that for all the show’s sass and subversiveness, RuPaul himself – as exemplified by his own glamazon persona – was a traditional kind of drag queen, who prioritised, as the book puts it, “cisgender men dressing as hyperfeminine women”. That shut out transgender queens – Pasulka reports that some even delayed their transition so they could compete on Drag Race – drag kings, non-binary performers and cis women. After a lot of social media pressure, Drag Race has become more inclusive – non-binary performers come along every series, and the most recent season of the UK version featured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/24/time-to-sashay-away-why-drag-race-uk-risks-losing-its-cheeky-charm\" title=\"\">Victoria Scone</a>, a cis woman from Cardiff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine's biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The explosion of trans, drag and queer culture over the past decade, of which this book examines one particular aspect, has been remarkably effective in putting previously marginalised groups in spaces that were once closed to them. Pasulka touches on the popularity of drag queens among children, with events like Drag Queen Story Hour taking place in libraries around America – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/04/drag-queens-targeted-us-far-right\" title=\"\">a favourite target of conservative ire</a>. But How to Get Famous also asks whether attaining mainstream acceptance is even a goal worth pursuing, especially when fame as a drag queen seems to entail heaving enormous suitcases of costumes around the world while getting non-stop abuse on social media, or a lifestyle of constant nightclubbing that is bound to catch up with you eventually. The book ends with the quintessential Brooklyn queen Aja defying the haters by deciding to make rap music – and to transition.</p> <p>Pasulka writes effectively about how drag performances felt like an act of resistance after Trump’s election in the US: as Drag Race winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/29/sasha-velour-drag-is-darkness-turned-into-power-rupaul-drag-race-interview\" title=\"\">Sasha Velour</a> points out, “Here in our utopian dreamworld … we get to be in charge”. Pasulka has provided a valuable service in noting down for posterity performances that were shambolic, ephemeral and only viewed by a handful of late night barflys in rackety venues like Metropolitan in Brooklyn. One that sticks out is by a drag queen called Charlene, who turns Britney Spears’ Til It’s Gone into a doom-laden melodrama in which she throws herself around the stage in a bra and knickers to a montage of childhood photographs, then produces a pair of scissors and pretends to hack off her penis, finally swinging from a ceiling beam naked and covered in fake blood. The MC’s response is “Oh my God! Who wants a hotdog?”</p> <p>With such vivid visual material, it’s a shame that the images in this book often feel posed or like press shots, rather than capturing the queens in full throttle. The writing sometimes suffers from a lack of imagination: we really need a new metaphor for being delighted by abundance without resorting to kids and candy stores. But nonetheless, like the queens she writes about, Pasulka manages to fashion something original and compelling from a disparate hotchpotch of sources: nightlife history, social media chat and reportage, all stitched together with great respect and love.</p> <p>• How You Get Famous: Ten Years of Drag Madness in Brooklyn is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (£20).

Swim queen Emma McKeon won six gold medals – she alone sits fourth on the medal tally, ahead of the entire New Zealand team. Australian swimmers swept the podium in four events: the men’s 400m freestyle and the women’s 50m, 100m and 200m freestyle. And such was the strength and breadth of the Dolphins that there were only seven podiums across the entire meet that did not feature at least one Australian.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/commonwealth-games-day-six-roundup-australia\">Ariarne Titmus and Australia’s swimmers wrap up golden Commonwealth Games </a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was, in other words, an extraordinary swim meet for the Australians. This is not itself surprising – Australia has a long history of dominating the Commonwealth Games, including the swimming. Indeed at the last Games on the Gold Coast, the Dolphins performed slightly better, winning 28 of 50 gold medals. But placed into the wider context – following an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/10/australias-swimmers-target-paris-after-record-breaking-tokyo-medal-haul\">emphatic return to Olympic form at Tokyo 2020 last year</a>, and with many Australians backing up in Birmingham not long after the world championships – and the signs are positive with two years to go until the Paris Olympics.</p> <p>The performances are all the more impressive given the media storm that hung over the meet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/kyle-chalmers-silences-critics-but-focus-on-swimmers-personal-life-has-been-absurd\">an almost-obsessive focus</a> on the supposed love triangle between McKeon, freestyle king Kyle Chalmers and pop star turned swimmer Cody Simpson. Despite the distraction and its consequences for the mental health of several in the team, they managed to perform when it counted.</p> <p>In the past that might not have been assured – the Dolphins have previously struggled with controversy and the glare of the spotlight (most famously at the 2012 Olympics). The team’s decision to send home youngster Isaac Cooper prior to the Games for “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/22/swimmer-isaac-cooper-breaks-silence-after-being-sent-home-from-commonwealth-games-camp\">wellbeing challenges</a>” recalled those dark days, but – beyond some terse words from Chalmers to the media – the Dolphins let their swimming do the talking.</p> <p>Tokyo stars McKeon, Ariarne Titmus and Kaylee McKeown led the charge. Titmus showed her strength across multiple distances by winning the 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle crowns. While 15-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh was hot on Titmus’s heels in the 400m, the prodigy is not yet truly threatening. That will likely change by Paris, where a three-way duel between Titmus, McIntosh and American Katie Ledecky could be the encounter of the meet. McKeown got the better of Canadian rival Kylie Masse in both the 100m and 200m backstroke, a repeat of the outcomes at last year’s Olympics. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a23529d47b1014acaccd148ef829088a41e11eac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a23529d47b1014acaccd148ef829088a41e11eac/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elijah Winnington in action during a 200m freestyle heat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elijah Winnington in action during a 200m freestyle heat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Titmus and McKeown are only in their early 20s, but there is also a new, even younger crop of swimmers progressing through the Australian ranks. Eighteen-year-old Mollie O’Callaghan won the 100m freestyle and claimed silver in the 200m and the 50m backstroke. The Dean Boxall-coached youngster, who already has two Olympic gold medals to her name courtesy of Tokyo relay spots, has a bright future ahead. Fellow teenager Elizabeth Dekkers missed out on the Olympics after misfiring at last year’s trials, but bounced back in Birmingham – her 200m butterfly gold was her first win at a major international competition.</p> <p>Among the men, Elijah Winnington backed up his recent world title to win the 400m freestyle. The 22-year-old was hot favourite to win gold in Tokyo only to underperform; his recent form suggests that was a blip that won’t be repeated. Zac Stubblety-Cook added the 200m breaststroke gold to his Olympic crown, while emerging stars William Yang and Flynn Southam performed well in the relays.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/kyle-chalmers-silences-critics-but-focus-on-swimmers-personal-life-has-been-absurd\">Kyle Chalmers silences critics but focus on his personal life has been absurd | Kieran Pender</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia’s para-swimmers were also in fine form at the Sandwell pool. While the Games include just a fraction of the categories on offer at the Paralympics or world championships – only six events for the men and six for the women – the Australians won half of the available races.

The lobby group heralded her victory as evidence that “being pro-Israel is both good policy and good politics”. But critics noted that much of Aipac’s spending was on negative campaigning against Levin that did not mention Israel.</p> <p>Levin was backed by the more liberal pro-Israel group, J Street. It contrasted Aipac’s endorsement of more than 100 Republican members of Congress who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s presidential election victory with the “onslaught of rightwing outside spending and baseless smears” to defeat a progressive candidate with a history of supporting unions and civil rights.</p> <p>Aipac, through its political action committee, the United Democracy Project, has raised millions of dollars from Republican billionaires such as the Trump campaign funders Paul Singer and Bernie Marcus to defeat candidates not considered pro-Israel enough.</p> <p>Other pro-Israel groups, such as the Democratic Majority for Israel and Pro-Israel America, have also spent heavily to oppose candidates regarded as anti-Israel in Democratic primaries from Texas to Ohio and California.</p> <p>“This aggressive intervention in Democratic primaries – by a group funded in part by Republican mega-donors – to promote an unpopular agenda is harmful to American foreign policy, to the Democratic party and ultimately to the State of Israel,” said J Street, which is <a href=\"https://jstreet.org/press-releases/rep-andy-levins-defeat-is-a-sad-moment-for-diplomacy-and-democracy/\">more critical</a> of Israeli policies that perpetuate domination of the Palestinians.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"(https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/pro-israel-lobby-aipac-andy-levin-democratic-races\">interview</a> with the Guardian during the campaign, Levin warned that Aipac’s involvement raised the specter of the entire primary process being hijacked by well-funded lobbies such as big oil and the gun industry.</p> <p>“I don’t think the Democratic party can really stand for it and maintain the integrity of our own elections,” he said.</p> <p>After his defeat, Levin said he “will continue to speak out against the corrosive influence of dark money on our democracy”.</p> <p>J Street has called on Democratic candidates to decline Aipac’s support, saying that it is intended to warn politicians against criticism of Israel’s actions or risk a well-funded campaign against them.</p> <p>“With their overwhelming spending, Aipac hopes to send an intimidating message to others: cross our red lines, and you could be next. While political space for open and healthy debate over US foreign policy has opened up considerably in recent years, they appear determined to close it down,” it said.</p> <p>Aipac has <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/recips.php?cmte=C00799031&amp;cycle=2022\">poured</a> more than $24m into defeating Democratic primary candidates critical of Israel.

They also need to stop beating themselves up about procrastinating and be kinder to themselves.</p> <p>Sirois, a professor of psychology at Durham, said procrastination among students was worryingly high. “It’s estimated that anywhere between 80 and 95% of new students procrastinate at least once or more, but 50% of students procrastinate chronically and that is a real issue.”</p> <p>In the wider adult population an estimated 15-25% of people frequently procrastinate.</p> <p>Procrastination has never been a good thing despite some researchers arguing the benefits of “positive procrastination”. Sirois said: “Embedded in the definition of procrastination is that you unnecessarily and voluntarily delay an important intended task despite knowing that the consequences are harmful. How can that be positive?”</p> <p>At its core is an irrational and emotional act, Sirois said. “Procrastination is a form of emotion regulation where sufferers avoid a task that might spark negative emotions, by disengaging with it or putting it off.”</p> <p>Sirois said harsh judgment was not the solution and procrastinators needed to know they were not lazy – and they did not just need to work on their organisation or time management.</p> <p>Procrastination, she said, is due to “not being able to manage our emotions internally. So we manage them externally. We take that task that is unpleasant or boring, or frustrating or stressful … and by putting it aside we get an immediate feeling of relief.</p> <p>“But we’ve done it temporarily and we’ve done it externally so it is going to come back to haunt us.”</p> <p>One of the reason Sirois said she wanted to write the book “was to help people recognise what was driving procrastination and find ways of helping them get out of that cycle”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chronic procrastination can have an impact on people’s health, wellbeing and career, resulting in stress, anxiety and shame.</p> <p>Sufferers have been found to have less job security and more limited career progression.

But it doesn’t have to be that way, there are ways to address it and there is hope for those caught in a pattern of chronic procrastination.</p> <p>“My hope is that through sharing my expertise via a practical self-help book, procrastinators the world over can start to overcome the problem and fulfil their dreams and goals.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/procrastination\">Procrastination: What it is, why it’s a problem and what you can do about it</a> is published by the American Psychological Association and is out now.</p> <h2>Famous procrastinators</h2> <p><strong>Victor Hugo</strong> agreed to write The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1829. <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/647298/what-victor-hugo-teach-about-procrastination\">A year later, after lots of entertaining and pursuing other projects, the book was still not completed</a>.

People of colour are identified as being at greatest risk of being targeted.</p> <p>While not all of these techniques are new, the report – A Very British Problem: The Evolution of Britain’s Militarised Policing Industrial Complex – maps their increasing use in recent years and says the technology “vastly tips power in favour of the state”.</p> <p>It states: “Black activists are disproportionately subjected to excessive police force. Armed counter-terrorism units, immigration enforcement and UK Border Force draw directly from the military handbook. Police officers are increasingly acting like border guards working with the Home Office to carry out immigration control.”</p> <p>It expresses concern that surveillance technology is being rolled out in the absence of sufficient legislative or parliamentary oversight. While many organisations are involved with the deployment of technologies such as AI and facial recognition, there is no single body guiding the adoption of these new technologies.</p> <p>Key areas of concern include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Mobile fingerprint scanners, which many police forces now use and are linked to the Home Office’s immigration and asylum biometric system, which holds the fingerprints of non-UK citizens who have entered the country.</p></li> <li><p>The Home Office biometrics programme, a new digital system to allow biometric and other data to be shared seamlessly between police, immigration enforcement and other government departments.</p></li> <li><p>Use of military-grade drones to patrol the Channel to carry out surveillance on asylum seekers crossing in small boats.</p></li> <li><p>A gangs matrix that profiles people believed to be gang members, whether or not they have committed any crime. A 2016 survey of the matrix by Amnesty International found that 87% of those on it were from BAME backgrounds.</p></li> </ul> <p>The report’s author, Dr Keren Weitzberg, said: “The police are increasingly relying on hi-tech, data-driven and military-grade technology to surveil the British population.”</p> <p>Sam Perlo-Freeman, a research coordinator at CAAT, said: “Policing in the UK is becoming steadily more repressive, but it’s not just about what the UK is doing to its own citizens. The UK trains foreign police and security services, especially around border control.”</p> <p>Emily Apple, a communications coordinator at Netpol, said: “This report busts the myth that the police in the UK govern, or have ever governed, by consent. It lays out what those from marginalised communities know all too well, that institutionalised and structural racism results in overpolicing, excessive force and disproportionate criminalisation.</p> <p>With the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, we’re more likely to see increased criminalisation and surveillance of protesters. It’s down to all of us to monitor what the police are doing and to defend our right to dissent.”</p> <p>The Home Office said: “All policing and law enforcement practices are underpinned by some of the most robust guidance and laws in the world and to suggest otherwise is wrong.</p> <p>“Agencies, including police, immigration enforcement and Border Force will face times when they put themselves in danger to deliver for the public, so it is only right they are trained and deploy to the highest standards.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/04/isle-of-wight-beach-trip-seagrass-volunteering-ecology","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Fronds reunited: an Isle of Wight trip to restore a priceless ecosystem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/04/isle-of-wight-beach-trip-seagrass-volunteering-ecology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/04/isle-of-wight-beach-trip-seagrass-volunteering-ecology","fields":{"headline":"Fronds reunited: an Isle of Wight trip to restore a priceless ecosystem","trailText":"Seagrass protects us from coastal erosion – and it’s under threat.

Like most members of our 12-strong group, Kevin signed up for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust’s coastal survey volunteer day to help soothe his climate anxiety.</p> <p>“It feels good to be doing something for our coastal environment rather than sitting at home worrying about ecosystem collapse,” he says; the last time he poked about in rock pools was as a child in the 1970s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a8130e5c6dfe0f21762f9edf918106abf39d2fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a8130e5c6dfe0f21762f9edf918106abf39d2fa/81_0_3780_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Helens beach on the Isle of Wight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Helens beach on the Isle of Wight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VisitIsleofWight.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kevin and I are standing side by side, up to our welly ankles in an Isle of Wight rock pool, marvelling at the marine life around our feet. There are molluscs of all sizes, and metres of blond bladderwrack; there are the peculiar, potato-shaped organisms known as sea squirts and, further into the intertidal zone where the green shore seaweeds give way to gold and red hues, today’s holy grail: a group of flowering marine plants that represent one of our planet’s bright hopes when it comes to tackling climate change.</p> <p>“Seagrasses are the unsung heroes of marine ecosystems,” says Emily Stroud, a marine biologist, who is leading today’s Isle of Wight intertidal survey. “They absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the surrounding seawater, and their long leaves slow the water’s flow, which encourages carbon to settle on the seabed, where it is then buried. These little stars protect us from coastal erosion, too.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s common for seagrasses to be removed so that a beach looks more like the postcards</p> <footer> <cite>Leanne Cullen-Unsworth</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sadly, in most global contexts these industrious marine flora – which include ribbon-like common eelgrasses, the flat-fronted enhalus grass and Mediterranean species such as Neptune grass – are in retreat. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/04/catastrophic-uk-has-lost-90-of-seagrass-meadows-study-finds\">More than 90% of Britain’s seagrass has been lost</a>, with much of that destruction occurring in the 20th century, when poor water quality caused by rapid industrialisation led to a wasting disease that razed our native meadows. Sediments and turbidity have played their part, as has physical damage from anchors and fishing nets, commercial seaweed production, and the tourist industry – notably in the Pacific and south-east Asia – where a desire for pristine-looking beaches has led to the removal of seagrasses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5647ebeb2b4eaf15792bbd8fbc0b03bd30ccc23e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5647ebeb2b4eaf15792bbd8fbc0b03bd30ccc23e/0_0_586_435/500.jpg\" alt=\"Seagrass ready to be planted.\" width=\"500\" height=\"371\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seagrass ready to be planted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Project Seagrass</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The way Stroud sees it, seagrasses are a prime example of the wonders that our shores have in store, if we are willing to protect these precious habitats rather than defacing them for our narrow take on what constitutes a beach idyll.</p> <p>“It’s common for seagrasses to be removed so that a beach looks more like the postcards,” says Leanne Cullen-Unsworth, founder of <a href=\"https://www.projectseagrass.org/\">Project Seagrass</a>.

The trust’s volunteer survey data, alongside data from the Wildlife Trust’s <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/get-involved/other-ways-get-involved/shoresearch\">Shoresearch</a> programme, will be used by government adviser Natural England to monitor the effects of global heating. On a survey in 2020, the team spotted the bright-pink eggs of a breeding sea hare – a snouted pink sea snail more commonly found on the California coast. Brightly coloured European and cuckoo wrasse fish have been recorded at Keyhaven in Hampshire.</p> <p>“There are some species we keep an eye out for,” says Stroud, “as they are climate change indicators, like peacock’s tail algae. We’re at the eastern limit for that scarce species here, so if its dispersal starts to move further north, we can assume something is seriously afoot with sea temperatures.”</p> <p>Fellow marine volunteer Sarah wants to set up a weekend rock-pooling school for Isle of Wight children, and is keen to get to know her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/24/brittle-star-sea-dinosaurs-at-risk-from-commercial-fishing-researchers-say\">brittle stars</a> from her bryozoans. “It’s not quite swimming cozzie and sunglasses,” she laughs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"198c832ad02d7133525985447300aa472b9ee307\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/198c832ad02d7133525985447300aa472b9ee307/50_136_5084_3050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers at work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers at work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Garnham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We peer underneath rocks as seagulls caw around us and kitesurfers carve across a bay bathed in spring sunshine. “Look,” she says, her camera trained on a rock pool that shines an almost metallic cobalt, reflecting the blue sky above.

The main camera produces the best images that have generally good colour balance and detail. Photos can lack a little sharpness and fine detail when viewed at full size, and it can be a little difficult to get a sharp shot in low light. The ultrawide produces images with cooler tones and softer detail but is still decent. The camera can occasionally oversaturate parts of an image, such as red flowers losing all definition and almost glowing.</p> <p>The phone has no telephoto camera but the digital zoom produced usable images at 2x, becoming full of artefacts after about 5x magnification. The glyphs can be lit up to create a fill light at night instead of using the flash, which is novel but produces a blue hue to the images. The selfie camera is equally good, producing detailed photos in good light.</p> <p>Video recording was solid for the money but only up to 4K at 30 frames a second, not 60 as is increasingly common.</p> <p>Overall, the Phone 1 is capable of producing really good images, and beats many mid-range rivals, but won’t trouble the best.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"399c71a355d73f0b088b7733985498cfe7df6bf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/399c71a355d73f0b088b7733985498cfe7df6bf9/7_337_3732_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing the fingerprint scanner lighting up beneath the screen of the Nothing Phone 1.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The optical fingerprint scanner under the screen is fast and accurate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Nothing Phone 1 costs £399 (A$749) with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, £449 (A$799) with 8GB and 256GB, or £499 (A$849) with 12GB and 256GB, and is available in black or white depending on the model.</p> <p>For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/22/google-pixel-6a-review-this-mid-range-master-is-a-true-bargain\">Google Pixel 6a</a> costs <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_6a\">£399</a>, the Samsung Galaxy A53 costs <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a53-5g-awesome-black-128gb-sm-a536bzkneub/\">£399</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/15/fairphone-4-review-ethical-repairable-phone-gets-big-upgrade\">Fairphone 4</a> costs <a href=\"https://shop.fairphone.com/gb_en/buy-fairphone-4\">£499</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/21/apple-iphone-se-2022-review-dated-design-but-bargain-price-camera\">Apple iPhone SE</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-se\">£419</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Phone 1 is a remarkably well-executed first attempt at a smartphone from Nothing.</p> <p>Its design is distinctive on the back and simple elsewhere. You might not like the iPhone-like look but the recycled aluminium sides certainly feel more premium than the competitive mid-range price might suggest.</p> <p>The glyph lights on the back are certainly novel and eye-catching but remembering which pattern is which is difficult, and I typically avoid putting phones face down to prevent scratches. It is good to see something different and fun, though.</p> <p>Despite an odd bug due to be fixed, the Android software is pleasingly bloat-free, which helps the phone feel snappy in use. The battery life is pretty good, too. Four years of promised software updates is good but not the best, and relies on Nothing succeeding in fulfilling its commitment, which is not guaranteed for any new entrant.</p> <p>It has very stiff competition from rivals such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/22/google-pixel-6a-review-this-mid-range-master-is-a-true-bargain\">Google’s excellent Pixel 6a</a>, but compared with a lot of boring mid-range phones, the £399 Nothing Phone 1 stands out.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> novel back design, glyph lights are something different, good screen,

backed by mining billionaire Clive Palmer that would have dug for the fossil fuel just 10km from Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef coastline.</p> <p>Palmer’s Central Queensland Coal project would have mined up to 18m tonnes a year from two open-cut pits near Rockhampton.</p> <p>It comes amid calls from the Greens to ban new coal and gas projects as the Albanese government’s bill to enshrine a 43% cut to greenhouse gas emissions made its way to the Senate.</p> <p>The decision is the new environment minister’s first in the portfolio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

Reef, but global heating could jeopardise recovery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Environmentalists said the proposed refusal was a victory for the state, for the Great Barrier Reef, for the environment and for the climate.</p> <p>A Queensland state government assessment said last year the Central Queensland Coal project was “not suitable” and would risk damaging the reef as well as wetlands, fish habitat and ecosystems that depended on groundwater.</p> <p>An official notice said the minister is proposing to refuse the mine under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and has invited public comment on her draft decision, with submissions closing on 18 August.</p> <p>In a statement, the minister said: “Based on the information available to me at this stage, I believe that the project would be likely to have unacceptable impacts to the Great Barrier Reef marine park, and the values of the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area and national heritage place.”</p> <p>“The available evidence also suggests that the project would be likely to have unacceptable impacts on water resources in the area.”</p> <p>She said Palmer’s company had been contacted, adding a final decision would be made after public comments were received.</p> <p>“While I am seeking comment on my proposed decision, and until I make my final decision on this project, I am unable to make any further statements on the matter.”</p> <p>Last year Queensland’s state government sent a final assessment of the mine to the federal government, saying it posed “a number of unacceptable risks”.</p> <p>Conservationists had called on the previous environment minister, Sussan Ley, to refuse the mine.</p> <p>Palmer’s company had rejected claims the mine would do unacceptable damage. Guardian Australia called the Brisbane office of Central Queensland Coal, but was told nobody was available to speak as “everyone from the company is on site in central Queensland”.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The director of the Queensland Conservation Council, Dave Copeman, said: “This prompt decision is a welcome change from the delayed and questionable decision making approach of the previous Morrison government.”</p> <p>“It looks like we now have a minister that understands the science, is willing to listen to community concerns, and act accordingly.</p> <p>“We won’t reach Australia’s 43% 2030 emissions reduction targets, that passed the House of Representatives today, without strong decisions such as this.</p> <p>“This will be overwhelmingly positive news for the many locals and organisations who have been making clear the local and scientific opposition to this project.”</p> <p>Cherry Muddle, a Great barrier Reef campaigner at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said they hoped the minister “rejects this mine once and for all” and pointed to modelling suggesting mine sediments would have had disastrous impacts on an area that was rich in marine life.</p> <p>“In the wake of the fourth mass bleaching event on the reef since 2016, it is vital new coal and gas projects like this one are refused,” Muddle said.</p> <p>“It shows the government are serious about saving the reef and tackling the issues that threaten it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/04/bogie-shooting-police-responding-to-reports-of-four-people-shot-in-north-queensland","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T05:36:40Z","webTitle":"Police confirm three dead near Collinsville and man in critical condition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/bogie-shooting-police-responding-to-reports-of-four-people-shot-in-north-queensland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/bogie-shooting-police-responding-to-reports-of-four-people-shot-in-north-queensland","fields":{"headline":"Police confirm three dead near Collinsville and man in critical condition","trailText":"Officers say they are still searching the Bogie area and don’t know who was responsible for the shooting","byline":"Natasha May","body":"<p>Three people have died in a shooting at a cattle property near the north <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland\">Queensland</a> town of Collinsville, police have confirmed.</p> <p>Police said they found three bodies and a crime scene in the remote rural location.</p> <p>A man who was taken to Mackay base hospital earlier told police he and three other people had been shot.</p> <p>He was found in a vehicle at Flagstone with a gunshot wound to the abdomen soon after police were notified about 9am on Thursday.

Of Foreign Affairs/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>The “One China” policy</p> <p>More than 70 years of history lies behind the tensions over Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. Ever since the losing side in China’s civil war fled to the island in 1949 and established a government there, Beijing has insisted Taiwan is a breakaway province rather than an independent nation.</p> <p>Generations of China’s communist leaders have vowed to take it back, but the current president Xi Jinping has given the “Taiwan question” new urgency with a more assertive stance that has led many to conclude a military takeover is more likely than it previously appeared.</p> <p>The US officially retains a “One China” policy that maintains formal diplomatic ties with China and not Taiwan – and a posture of “strategic ambiguity” over how it would respond to a Chinese attack. In recent months Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/fears-bidens-taiwan-comments-may-raise-tensions-despite-rowback\">has appeared to promise</a> Taiwan military support if that happens, but the White House insists the US position has not changed.</p> <p>For more, see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/china-and-taiwan-whats-behind-the-tensions-in-30-seconds\">this explainer</a> by Helen, or listen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/nov/03/could-china-ever-invade-taiwan-and-what-would-happen-next\">this excellent episode</a> of Today in Focus from last November for a longer view.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The buildup</p> <p>Timing is everything in diplomacy. If Pelosi had made her trip to Taiwan in April, when it was first scheduled, it probably would have generated less heat, Vincent says. But Pelosi got Covid, and cancelled.</p> <p>This week, there’s a different context: “China’s People’s Liberation Army was celebrating its 95th founding anniversary, speculation over Xi Jinping’s third term is rife, the Chinese Communist party’s summer retreat is supposedly going on, and there’s a slowing economy that has left many unable to find a job.”</p> <p>That means the visit is embarrassing for Xi and presents a challenge to which Beijing feels compelled to respond – perhaps as well as an opportunity to distract from internal economic difficulties.</p> <p>In Taiwan, there was relatively little coverage of the impending trip until recently: London School of Economics researcher Mariah Thornton <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/cff/2022/08/02/pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-a-cross-strait-crisis-or-continuation/\">pointed out</a> that it had featured <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wentisung/status/1553358924384174080\">24 minutes into a primetime evening news bulletin</a> at the weekend. (In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/china-us-taiwan-nancy-pelosi-visit\">this piece</a>, Taipei-based journalist Brian Hioe reflects a common refrain in Taiwan: “For now at least, life carries on as usual.”)</p> <p>“People here have been more focused on elections, the heatwave, they’re not that bothered by Chinese threats because they’ve been coming for so long,” Helen said. “But once it was confirmed Pelosi was on the way, that really switched things up.”</p> <p>At one point on Tuesday, the FlightRadar site <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/flightradar24-down-live-plane-tracking-site-goes-offline-b2136429.html\">briefly went offline</a> as <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-flight-tracking\">more than 700,000 people</a> used it to follow Pelosi’s plane – making it the most tracked flight of all time.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The reception in Taiwan</p> <p>Helen went to the airport and found a couple of hundred people awaiting the US delegation’s arrival, including a quickly organised demonstration of support; at Pelosi’s hotel later, there were “maybe 1,000 people, most of them supporters, but an anti-Pelosi crowd too, chanting things like ‘Yankee go home’.”</p> <p>In general, Helen adds, “there is a lot of nuance in the discussion here. People are generally very supportive because it keeps them front of mind for the world, they feel it offers a layer of protection. But on the flip side, there’s a feeling that the execution of this trip has caused a lot of problems.”</p> <p>Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/21/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-trip-not-good-idea-right-now-joe-biden\">said last month</a> that a visit was “not a good idea right now”, and the White House has sought to emphasise that the trip <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/08/biden-administration-insists-pelosi-taiwan-visit-doesnt-change-us-policy\">does not signal</a> a change in the US stance – but many Republicans in the US <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/3584386-mcconnell-25-gop-senators-back-pelosi-taiwan-trip/\">have supported it</a>, and whatever Biden says, it does appear to chime with the shifts that many detect in his informal statements, if not in official policy.</p> <p>“There’s a feeling it ratcheted things up a bit,” said Helen. “That the escalation in general has been on the Chinese side, but this hasn’t helped.”</p> <p>Despite all that, once the plan for the trip leaked, there was a consensus view among those Helen spoke to with government connections that it had to go ahead. “They said their real fear was that if the US backed out, what message did that send about the support they were willing to give?”</p> <p>***</p> <p>The reception in the region</p> <p>“Many countries feel worried and upset,” says Vincent. “There is a concern about anything that could jeopardise the prosperity of the world’s most populous region. They ask whether this was the right way to show solidarity.”</p> <p>Ben Bland, director of the Asia-Pacific programme at London-based thinktank Chatham House, told Vincent that many governments in Asia “are concerned about Beijing’s increasingly assertive behaviour … But, at the same time, they fear that the stridency of the response across different parts of the US political system risks further provoking China.”</p> <p>One striking example of this was the response of Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, who on Wednesday said that “all parties” – not just China – “should consider how they best contribute to de-escalating the current tensions”.</p> <p>***</p> <p>How China is responding</p> <p>The statecraft of Pelosi’s trip to Taipei has now given way to much rawer expressions of power: live-fire drills by the Chinese military, with five coastal areas around Taiwan – including some that go deep into Taiwan’s claimed waters – occupied in naval exercises. China has ordered all boats and aircraft to avoid these areas for three days – a direct challenge to the US and Taiwanese presence in the region.</p> <p>Two unidentified aircraft, believed to be US military, have meanwhile appeared on flight trackers around Taiwan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/04/china-expected-to-begin-live-fire-military-exercises-near-taiwan-coast-in-wake-of-pelosi-visit-live?page=with:block-62eb4c8f8f0892e28b4ab7ad#block-62eb4c8f8f0892e28b4ab7ad\">Helen reports this morning</a>.

Track a drug kingpin’s movements in real time? Or know how much Taylor Swift’s jets are polluting the air? They’re all streaming live on the sleeper hit of the summer: online flight trackers.</p> <p>On Tuesday, viewers set new records on Flightradar24, one of the largest flight tracker websites in the world, as they watched the seven-hour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/mood-shifts-in-taiwan-as-nancy-pelosi-visit-raises-fears-of-war\">flight of Nancy Pelosi</a> from Kuala Lumpur to Taipei. The trip, shrouded in secrecy until its final moments, grabbed international attention after China made military threats in the weeks leading up to the visit, and then launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/china-to-begin-series-unprecedented-live-fire-drills-off-coast-of-taiwan\">live-fire exercises</a> once she had departed.</p> <p>Many Taiwanese people were glued to the flight trackers: one told me their friend’s child had asked to stay up late to watch the live tracker – “like the new year’s countdown,” the parent had remarked drily.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/02/taylor-swift-private-jet-carbon-emissions-blatantly-incorrect\">Taylor Swift: claims about private jet use ‘blatantly incorrect’, says spokesperson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ian Petchenik, the head of communications for Flightradar24, said the site had seen “unprecedented sustained interest” over Pelosi’s flight, and at its peak, a record 708,000 people were simultaneously watching the little red icon representing the House speaker’s Boeing C-40C – callsign SPAR19 – as it looped around the Philippines to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/world/asia/pelosis-widely-watched-flight-to-taipei-took-a-circuitous-route-heres-why.html\">bypass Chinese bases</a> in the South China Sea, then soared across the Luzon Strait, reportedly under the watchful cover of a <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/us-carrier-pair-ships-carrying-182818020.html\">trio of US aircraft carriers</a>, and arced across Taiwan’s mountain ranges before touching down in Taipei.</p> <p>The amount of traffic made the Flightradar24 “unstable for some users” and the site was forced to limit access at certain points. In total, 2.92 million people tuned in to watch some portion of her flight, about three times as many people as followed it on CNN in prime time.</p> <p>Flightradar24 has had some other big moments of late: roughly 550,000 viewers tracked the flight of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, as he returned to Moscow in 2021 to face imprisonment. Thousands more tracked a US air force Global Hawk<a href=\"https://mil.in.ua/en/news/the-us-global-hawk-observed-ukraine-and-the-black-sea/\"> traveling around Ukraine</a> during the Russian invasion before flying out over the Black Sea. Viewers also used the site to follow the US’s chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan.</p> <p>The appeal is simple, Petchenik said: “You get to participate in history in real time. If the newspaper is the first draft of history, then this is the pre-write.” Flight tracker data has virtually no lag, providing a raw sense of immediacy. Another draw, Petchenik says, is the experience of watching flights with others and discussing them on social media. Just imagine the attention, Petchenik says, if you could have watched Nixon going to China in real time.</p> <p>It’s not just global news events that spark upticks in site traffic. As transfer deadline day approaches, it also becomes an essential tool for sports fans. “We see the most interest during the European football transfer window,” Petchenik said. “The teams have very dedicated fanbases. They will figure out what flight their favorite player is on, and they will follow that flight.”</p> <p>Flight trackers rely on a new open-standard surveillance technology called automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), which allows planes to transmit their locations and other information to anyone with a receiver. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3092d1a7c123a50df96952574d36c2b0f6cc511f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3092d1a7c123a50df96952574d36c2b0f6cc511f/0_59_1772_1064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"cables and a key ring in a box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Flightradar24 receiver kit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flightradar24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyone can set up an ADS-B receiver using inexpensive kits. That’s allowed Flightradar24 to go from a couple of receivers in Sweden, when the site was founded in 2007, to a huge network with more than 30,000 receivers around the world, many of them run by volunteers. The receivers have a range of a few hundred miles, though they struggle with terrain such as mountains. To close the gaps, Flightradar24 cross-references its ground-based receivers with data from other sources, including satellites and data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US.</p> <p>Subscribing to the government data comes with a catch: trackers must agree to abide by FAA rules that let aircraft owners request their information be removed from public websites. That means Flightradar24 displays some flights anonymously, though Petchenik can’t specify which ones.</p> <p>That’s where a popular uncensored flight tracker comes in: <a href=\"https://www.adsbexchange.com/\">ADS-B Exchange</a>. The website was founded as a hobby in 2016 by Dan Streufert, an IT professional who describes the site’s policy: “We don’t block anything.” That’s possible in part because the site doesn’t subscribe to the FAA feed. Instead, it relies on data funneled from a network of about 9,000 ADS-B receivers around the world run by aviation enthusiasts and other volunteers.</p> <p>Streufert’s network allows users to observe flights that powerful people want to be kept secret. Once, Streufert received a letter from a European lawyer who demanded ADS-B Exchange stop tracking his client’s flights. After looking up the flight data, Streufert realized: “The guy used to work for Gaddafi. He’s been accused of war crimes and killing people and yada yada. I guess somebody had used our data to figure out that he was moving gold from Venezuela to Libya on his private jet, and he wasn’t too happy about that being exposed.”</p> <p>ADS-B Exchange’s approach to open data has also allowed citizen journalists to reveal the habits of America’s rich and famous. This year, a 19-year-old programmer named Jack Sweeney created a bot that tweeted out the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/02/teen-tracking-elon-musk-jet-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-drake-jack-sweeney-tesla-flight-tracker-bot\">flight paths of Elon Musk</a>.

The ERC recently worked with the country’s Office of Trade and Commerce on a trial with 15 bakeries to see the impact of aid on price reduction.</p> <p>“When we donate to the bakeries, the price of bread goes down, so this is why these donations are critical in countering inflation and the problems of the currency collapse, especially as the country is now looking for alternative sources of grain in the wake of the Ukraine war,” Jafri said.</p> <p>During the trial in April, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the charity donated free flour to 15 bakeries for one month and managed to get retailers to reduce the price from 70 Yemeni riyals (23p) to 30 (10p) for a loaf, but the bakers refused to keep prices low, suffering as they were from inflation and rent hikes.</p> <p>Suhair Saeed Omer, a family medicine specialist at the Al Mahwar clinic in Mukallah, one of multiple hospitals built or renovated by Emirates Red Crescent, said Yemen cannot manage without international support. “Without foreign aid, this clinic couldn’t do the important work it is doing,” she said. “We simply cannot cope without it. We are lucky to have this support, but many other Yemenis are not.”</p> <p>More than 3 million people have been displaced from their homes since 2015; 150,000 people, fighters and civilians, have been killed.</p> <p>The war has also forced a generation of boys into a life of violence. At 16, Basem* became the de facto head of his family after his father was killed in a roadside ambush, shot by an al-Qaida gunman near the family home in Shahar, Hadramut province.</p> <p>Basem had to leave school and now earns £85 a month as a painter, to support his mother and five younger siblings. “It has been very tough,” he said. “Nobody told me what to do, so I just had to work things out as I went along.” His father left behind debts which made matters worse. “The debt collectors kept coming just days after my father’s death. There are no words to explain how frightened I was.”</p> <p>Shahar, liberated from al-Qaida by UAE forces which, backed by the government, now temporarily control the area, is vastly changed, he said. “Back then we couldn’t even leave home but even at home, we didn’t feel safe. We couldn’t even leave things outside as they’d be stolen. Today, thank God, life is very different.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2f6dc5ed49e7b87d98cc52be75a559e7e79500d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2f6dc5ed49e7b87d98cc52be75a559e7e79500d/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children chant slogans blaming the US and Israel for the war during a ceremony marking the conclusion of summer religious and training camps, Sana’a, 27 June 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children chant slogans blaming the US and Israel for the war during a ceremony marking the conclusion of summer religious and training camps, Sana’a, 27 June 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Houthi rebels are using the ceasefire to increase enforced recruitment of child soldiers, according to local rights investigators.

How can we calm this national rage?","byline":"Amy Fleming","body":"<p>In November 2019, a customer made a complaint to the insurance firm Ageas. Repairs had been carried out on his car after it was damaged in an accident, but he felt necessary work had been missed. Ageas sent out an engineer to inspect the vehicle, but it was decided that no further action was required. That’s when the abuse began, says Rachel Undy, operations leader at the company. “It was mostly sexist abuse – very angry – shouting, disgusting language and quite personal insults.” Over the months that followed, the customer contacted Ageas 98 times, in an increasingly threatening, and often grotesque, manner.</p> <p>“Eventually, we refused to speak to him, but then his emails carried on with the same language,” says Undy. At one point, she recalls, he made viciously crude remarks to her, before eventually directing his ire at the male engineer, too – “even threatening to come to the office and deal with him face to face”.</p> <p>Undy has seen an increase in the number of aggressive customers over the past couple of years, and staff at call centres are far from alone. You may have noticed the proliferation of “Don’t take it out on our staff” signs on pallid surgery walls, at train stations and family restaurants, or sometimes felt a palpable tension in the public spaces we all inhabit. From shop workers to waiters to surgery receptionists, public-facing staff say they have experienced a surge in abusive treatment since the Covid pandemic began. The number of shop workers who faced abusive customers has risen 25% since February this year according to the latest Institute of Customer Service (ICS) data, while the British Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/31/criminal-acts-of-violence-at-uk-gp-surgeries-almost-double-in-five-years#:~:text=The%2032%20forces%20recorded%201%2C068,98%20recorded%20in%202017%2D18.\">revealed in May</a> that criminal violence in GP surgeries had almost doubled in five years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When the good times roll and there are plenty of jobs and homes for everyone, it’s easy to be nice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In October 2021,<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/money/2021/oct/23/nurses-and-shop-staff-in-uk-face-tide-of-abuse-since-end-of-lockdowns\"> a survey</a> conducted for the ICS found that half of those dealing regularly with the public had experienced abuse in the past six months – a 6% rise – and 27% had been physically assaulted. The result has been a flurry of new policies, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/28/shop-workers-blame-cost-of-living-stress-for-rising-abuse\">legislation</a> allowing stronger penalties for abusers being introduced in an attempt to protect staff who serve the public. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/local-news/lincolnshire-council-staff-protected-aggressive-7295772\">Lincolnshire</a> council announced a plan to restrict access to some services for “vexatious” customers, in response to a significant rise in “verbally abusive and aggressive” behaviour directed at staff over the pandemic.</p> <p>The change in how some people behave means frontline workers must deal with an added layer of emotional legwork just to get the job done. “It’s really hard hearing someone say they hope my children will die,” Bradley, an ambulance call assessor, said recently, in support of the NHS ambulance staff <a href=\"https://aace.org.uk/vaa/\">Work Without Fear</a> initiative. At Ageas, Undy<strong> </strong>describes the months of abuse unleashed on her and the other staff as “draining, frustrating and insulting”. The abuse only ended when the customer’s insurance policy was cancelled and he was asked to sign a community resolution form by the police, which he did voluntarily.</p> <p>“By many, many metrics, violence has been on the decline for a very long time,” says Michael Muthukrishna, associate professor of economic psychology at the London School of Economics. “It looks much better than it has ever looked in the long run of history.” Yet in recent years, loneliness and mental health problems have been eroding confidence and resilience and here we are, crawling out of a world-shaking pandemic, only to face recession and climate change. We all experienced the Armageddon vibe of empty supermarket shelves during the pandemic, along with medical shortages and petrol pumps running dry. Too many people have been tipped into poverty by the cost of living crisis. I could go on.</p> <p>There is no excuse for abusive behaviour, but, Muthukrishna says: “Anything that increases stress is going to increase your anger and frustration, and your likelihood to lash out at someone. And maybe that’s sufficient to explain what was happening specifically during the pandemic.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2037a3852d68d30f6def0bade0f3cd02a6f599c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2037a3852d68d30f6def0bade0f3cd02a6f599c/0_0_1500_1634/918.jpg\" alt=\"Angry Britain illustration\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Behavioural science also points to a broader economic explanation. When the good times roll and there are plenty of jobs and homes for everyone, it’s easy to be nice. Muthukrishna has a neat car park analogy: “There are things that piss you off; like you might get annoyed when somebody slips into that space. If there are plenty of spaces, you’re like, ‘Oh, what an asshole,’ then you just find another space. Those fractures that always exist in a society are tolerated when there are enough spaces to go around. We describe this as a ‘positive-sum environment’ – where other people’s success doesn’t harm your ability to do well,” he says.</p> <p>The flipside comes when economic growth slows, creating a dreaded “zero-sum environment”: Now, he says, “other people’s success is predictive of your failure. This creates a completely different dynamic. If you’ve been driving around for 30 minutes and you finally see a parking space and someone behaves like that, you’re going to see some road rage.” This could explain why abuse continues to rise even as we attempt to return to normal. “People are kind of on edge. It’s been hard for a lot of people. But now we’re going through these more systemic shifts, where it looks like the pandemic has triggered some more longstanding, zero-sum psychological environments, where the competition moves from being productive to destructive.”</p> <p>This dark behavioural trend was already in motion pre-pandemic, as reflected in the World Economic Forum’s global risks <a href=\"https://www.zurich.com/en/knowledge/topics/global-risks/decline-human-empathy-creates-global-risks-age-of-anger\">report 2019</a>. Co-produced by the insurance company Zurich, one of the headline risks to global businesses reads: “Decline in human empathy creates global risks in the ‘age of anger’.” The report identified a new global phenomenon of people feeling “disconnected and isolated”, with technology and urbanisation cauterising social bonds. “Profound social instability” comes sixth in the <a href=\"https://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2019/survey-results/global-risks-of-highest-concern-for-doing-business-2019/#risk/R_SOCIALINSTABILITY\">top 30 chart</a> of risks in the report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c978b2a47c3b90871e817db11e3efd6b37f6d20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c978b2a47c3b90871e817db11e3efd6b37f6d20/0_0_6016_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Transport for London ‘Don’t take it out on our staff’ poster at a bus stop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Transport for London ‘Don’t take it out on our staff’ poster at a bus stop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LDNPix/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps, too, the dehumanising effects of communing online, which makes dishing out bile to strangers as easy as a “frictionless” online payment to a lot of people, has now spilled out on to the IRL streets, along with the extreme, polarising and reductive effects of social media. “The internet allows us to form new tribes along the lines of whatever we happen to be interested in or believe, and those new tribes are reshaping our societies in ways that we are still coming to terms with,” says Muthukrishna. “Any very small minority can find one another and begin to advocate for their common interests. It’s true of LGBT groups. It’s true of Arab spring groups, but it’s also true of QAnon, and white supremacist groups or whatever weird, perverted, crazy, obscure thing you happen to be interested in. It might be a good thing in the long term, but it is fundamentally destabilising.”</p> <p>Muthukrishna’s guess is that we’re “in for a tough few years”. But we are not powerless as individuals to mitigate the rise of rage. The more prepared we are for change, the smoother the ride will be. “If you create situations where people’s expectations are not met, you trigger zero-sum psychology,” he says. A great human strength is that we can adapt to different levels of comfort, but it’s the change, he says, “that triggers people”. Being prepared for the circumstances ahead, he suggests, “might go some way towards creating some solidarity, making people realise that we’re all in this together now. Where that’s not true, because of things like inequality, then you have to address those underlying things.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58b2f297733c3550294a2bc8d50452109abc9bea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58b2f297733c3550294a2bc8d50452109abc9bea/521_0_7707_4628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘The impact of verbal abuse on individuals is not insignificant.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The impact of verbal abuse on individuals is not insignificant.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: vm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there’s the Instagram effect. “It’s the Fomo [fear of missing out]: why is that person vacationing in Mauritius and I’m sitting here trying to pay my bills? And 10,000 people, or even 10 million people are seeing that person in Mauritius, feeling very dissatisfied,” says Muthukrishna. There is even research, he says, “showing that if your commute takes you through neighbourhoods that are wealthier than your own, you are more dissatisfied than if your commute takes you through neighbourhoods that are like – or worse than – yours.” Knowing this, and that many of the so-called best lives being lived online are false, there is no harm in reducing our exposure to such deeply deflating stimuli.</p> <p>The word should also be spread that being nasty to people who are trying to do their jobs only worsens the service we receive. Jo Causon,<strong> </strong>CEO of the Institute of Customer Service, points out that lack of staff is one of the key causes of poor service and customer frustration right now, and if we abuse staff, who are already working under increased pressure, they might quit, too. While being attacked and spat at is less common than verbal abuse, she says, the effects of the latter, particularly on those working from home, take a toll. “Some of these people have been on their own dealing with this. If you’re taking contact centre calls all day and several of those start to get pretty aggressive, the impact on individuals is not insignificant. It builds. We have seen a rise in people saying that they are not sure that they will stay on, and certainly a rise in sickness, too.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If people feel socially anxious, that could turn into frustration and anger</p> <footer> <cite>Gillian Sandstrom, University of Sussex</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In early July, Edinburgh airport had to temporarily close its customer service line, because it was deluged with irate customers trying to retrieve their luggage – even though baggage isn’t handled by the airport, but the short-staffed airlines. “In order to allow our teams to work through a backlog of airport queries,” <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-62190489\">said a spokesman</a>, “and to protect them from verbal abuse, we have taken the decision to temporarily suspend the phone lines.”</p> <p>Even if staff don’t resign, while they are unhappy they will be less able to provide a good service or defuse heated situations effectively. “There’s a link between employee engagement and customer satisfaction, and most people in customer-facing roles care and want to do the right thing,” says Coulson. “They are very motivated and like to have a conversation with someone in the local shop, or to make sure that person is doing OK.”</p> <p>Recognising how cheering and trust-building these random daily exchanges with strangers can be is yet another tool in the battle against abusive behaviour. Gillian Sandstrom, director of the Centre for Research on Kindness at the University of Sussex, spends most of her time either talking to strangers, or researching what happens when we do. During the first lockdown in 2020, she conducted a study in which she found that after participants talked to a stranger online, they reported feeling a greater sense of trust in other people. “So it can really change how you think about other people, to individualise them and maybe give people the benefit of the doubt.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb2d6e74a92f3cf07e97096c4d13fa5dc56e96c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb2d6e74a92f3cf07e97096c4d13fa5dc56e96c9/977_0_2138_2832/755.jpg\" alt=\"A ‘Respect goes both ways’ sign in a Nationwide building society window in Windsor.\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A ‘Respect goes both ways’ sign in a Nationwide building society window in Windsor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maureen McLean/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This could work both ways – by initiating a pleasant interaction with a stranger (who may or may not be providing you with a service) you might just jump-start their trust in their fellow humans, sending a beautiful cascade of goodwill trickling through the community.</p> <p>It doesn’t take long to build a habit, Sandstrom points out. “So the more often you train yourself to think about the other person, it should help you get into that conscious mode of remembering that they are human too.” If it feels like a big effort at first, that is because it is. “We’re naturally egoistic, and we all have to exert conscious effort to take someone else’s perspective into account. If we don’t make an effort to do that, [a tense exchange] is the kind of thing that’s going to happen.”</p> <p>These precious friendly encounters that people once took for granted, were one of the things we lost during the lockdowns, and it doesn’t take a leap of the imagination to see how that could have fed into those rising abusive situations. “A lot of times when we lash out,” she says, “it’s coming from fear, and if people feel socially anxious, that could turn into frustration and anger.”</p> <p>There are other fun ways to awaken lapsed empathy. Sandstrom mentions research showing that reading fiction can do this, and “going to the theatre, similarly, can help people feel more empathy”. And making ourselves come across as more individual could help to avoid being dehumanised by others who are disconnected. “Wear something that expresses your individuality,” she suggests.</p> <p>The great added bonus of talking to strangers, she says, is that it “puts people in a better mood, it makes people feel more connected. I think that’s because you are showing someone that you are seeing them as an individual.

No, the fabrications come from across the political establishment and they concern the future of our economy. And the ultimate fruit of these lies may well be another Johnson or Nigel Farage.</p> <p>Let’s start at the Bank of England which, this lunchtime, will almost certainly jack up borrowing costs, with possibly the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/Bank-Rate.asp\">biggest rate hike</a> in more than 25 years. The signs are that the UK is sliding into recession, but no matter: for the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, this is about bringing inflation to heel – “no ifs, no buts”, <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2022/july/andrew-bailey-speech-at-mansion-house-financial-and-professional-services-dinner\">as he says</a>, with all the pretend command of a flailing supply teacher. Yet the same Andrew Bailey <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/05/16/ftse-100-stock-markets-news-energy-price-cap-bank-england/\">admitted</a> to MPs just this May that he was “helpless” to stop inflation. As his colleagues testified, what is driving up prices in the UK is the global shortage of key commodities, from oil to food to semiconductor chips. What’s not to blame is wage rises, not when – according to economists at <a href=\"https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/insights/chief-investment-office/market-insights/paul-donovan/2022/pricing-the-cost-of-living.html\">UBS wealth management</a> – 99% of British workers are getting poorer.</p> <p>When inflation falls back, it will not be Threadneedle Street’s doing. Much more likely is a scenario akin to 2008, when the price of basics shot up so high economies tanked. By raising rates, Bailey wants to show he means business. What he is more likely to do is put firms out of business and sink households into a debt crisis.</p> <p>Then there is growth, something all the contenders to be prime minister pretend they can summon up. Rishi Sunak <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2022/08/02/rishi-sunak-i-didnt-get-into-politics-to-say-what-sounds-good-that-means-sometimes-taking-the-difficult-road-landing-the-less-popular-message-telling-the-truth\">vows</a> to make the UK “the most prosperous place in the world”, while Truss issues promises about “unleashing”, “unshackling” and “unchaining” Brexit Britain, as if it were mouldering in some continental jail. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer swears only he can “reboot our economy”. Is your entire unitary state on the blink? Then the leader of the opposition will be right round to turn it off and on again!</p> <p>The politicians are perpetrating the same scam as the rate-setters, bluffing they can get the old economic machinery working like before just by pulling this or that lever. Yet whether in Westminster or the City, both sides are flogging false optimism – and they know it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/tory-candidates-tax-plans-liz-truss-rishi-sunak\">The difference between the Tory candidates’ tax plans? One is bad, the other is really bad | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the past 50 years, almost every government has overseen lower economic growth than its predecessor – even as it has promised the opposite. That’s according to figures produced for this column by Kevin Albertson, a professor of economics at Manchester Metropolitan University. He analysed national income per person, adjusted for inflation, and then calculated<strong> </strong>a yearly rate of GDP growth for each prime minister. The end results are the sort of ugly truth Britain badly needs.<br><br>Even in this Tory leadership contest, Margaret Thatcher has been ordained as the prime minister who saved Britain’s economy. The reality is that economic growth during her reign was lower than under Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan. Then came Tony Blair, who by 2005 was still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jan/13/labour.uk\">promising</a> “New Labour, New Prosperity”, even while his government underperformed Thatcher’s. Blair also claimed “our economy is stronger and more stable than for generations”, which sounded laughably hollow two years later when Northern Rock fell over and the credit crisis began. Still, David Cameron did little better and Theresa May’s administration was truly abysmal.</p> <p>This is half a century of an economy becoming ever more stagnant, even as its leaders point excitedly to any passing ripple. And those ripples have normally meant more debt: Albertson’s analysis shows that every extra £1 of real GDP growth between Thatcher and the great banking crash came with nearly £2 of borrowing by households and government.</p> <p>This is the country described by political economists such as <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/4030-rentier-capitalism\">Brett Christophers</a>, <a href=\"http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/28891/1/WRAP_Crouch_privatised_Keynesianism.pdf\">Colin Crouch</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cresc.ac.uk/publications/\">Centre for Research on Socio-cultural Change</a>: an economy in which those at the top don’t go in for investment in research or technology but speculation and asset-stripping, and where governments dare not enquire too closely where private money is coming from and on what terms. This is an economic model that prizes its past – elderly people and asset owners – more than its future. Westminster’s usual fantasy fixes about big data or building on the green belt look risibly small against this backdrop. As Woody Allen nearly said, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans – but to give Him a really good giggle, say your plans were drawn up by the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/liz-truss-regional-pay-boards/\">Taxpayers’ Alliance</a>.</p> <p>We hear lies all the time, of course, about Brexit or pandemic preparedness. But the thing about economic lies is that we can easily rumble them – by checking our own pockets to see if we’re better off. Government after government has promised that if we work hard, we’ll get on – and they’ve not held their end of the bargain. The Resolution Foundation’s latest report, <a href=\"https://economy2030.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Stagnation_nation_interim_report.pdf\">Stagnation Nation</a> (a telling title, that one), makes the remarkable observation that every worker aged 31 and under “has never worked in an economy with sustained average wage rises”. That is eight million people, or about a quarter of the labour force, who have never seen work provide a rising standard of living.</p> <p>Posing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/13/tories-debt?CMP=gu_com\">in front of posters with babies</a>, Cameron pretended his spending cuts were to relieve the young of the worry of debt. What he actually did, as some of us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/06/george-osborne-growth-young-people\">warned at the time</a>, was plunge an entire generation into permanent precarity.</p> <p>The answer to this isn’t declinism, but realism. The UK is a very rich country. We can afford for kids not to go hungry during school holidays and for our grandparents not to freeze in winter. But rather than the usual delusions about Britain winning “the global race” or the economic pie getting exponentially bigger, it is time to focus on making the slices fairer, taking more away from those at the very top and sharing it out. If politicians keep peddling falsehoods about their strong and stable governments delivering a boom, then they can’t blame voters if they call them liars – and opt to listen to rather more entertaining fibbers with more spectacular stories to tell. The kind of yarn-spinners with whom they wouldn’t mind having a pint. That, you may recall, is partly how we ended up with Farage and Johnson in the first place. And it is a sure way of bringing on their successors.</p> <ul> <li><p>Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/04/horrific-first-nations-missing-and-murdered-cases-to-be-focus-of-australia-wide-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"‘Horrific’ First Nations missing and murdered cases to be focus of Australia-wide inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/horrific-first-nations-missing-and-murdered-cases-to-be-focus-of-australia-wide-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/horrific-first-nations-missing-and-murdered-cases-to-be-focus-of-australia-wide-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"‘Horrific’ First Nations missing and murdered cases to be focus of Australia-wide inquiry","trailText":"A Senate inquiry will examine the ‘mounting’ rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women and children","byline":"Sarah Collard","body":"<p>A landmark parliamentary inquiry will investigate the “horrific, extensive and unacceptable” rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women and children in Australia.</p> \n<p>The WA Greens senator, Dorinda Cox, successfully moved a motion for the inquiry in November, saying the high rates of violence experienced by First Nations women and children were unacceptable, but progress on the inquiry stalled before the federal election.</p> \n<p>“During that time we’ve had horrific, extensive and unacceptable rates of violence against First Nations women and children in this country and the missing cases and reports of our women keep mounting,” Cox, a former police officer in Western Australia, said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1e3d18b7-2d10-46a8-ac76-4eb7de88756d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XavZ5dx1mU4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Greens senator for Victoria, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/australian-greens-senator-lidia-thorpe-calls-queen-coloniser-while-being-sworn-into-parliament\">Lidia Thorpe</a>, said on Thursday there was a disparity between how Australia regards violence against Indigenous women and children and non-Indigenous women and children.</p> \n<p>“When a white woman dies, or a white woman is murdered, it’s a front page [article].

Supply of this vaccine is available to states and territories through the national medical stockpile. It hasn’t been widely used, since smallpox has been eradicated.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/15/monkeypox-australia-virus-what-are-symptoms-should-we-be-worried-cases-transmission-what-is-it\">Monkeypox virus: what are the symptoms and should Australia be worried?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/there-s-shortage-monkeypox-vaccine-could-one-dose-instead-two-suffice\">more than 70 countries now affected by monkeypox outbreaks</a>, this newer vaccine is in short supply globally. </p> \n<h2>How do the vaccines<strong> </strong>work?</h2> \n<p>The older ACAM2000<strong> </strong>vaccine is made from a virus called vaccinia, which is a type of pox virus related to smallpox and monkeypox, but which does not cause either disease, and which is also much milder than both viruses.</p> \n<p>Administering the vaccine requires special training.</p> \n<p>The skin is repeatedly scratched with a needle dipped into the vaccine. The virus begins to grow at the injection site, causing a red, itchy sore spot, or a “pock” in the days afterwards. It then eventually blisters and scabs over, and may leave a small scar.</p> \n<p>The vaccine stimulates the immune system to develop antibodies that can then help the body recognise and then fight an infection if exposure to monkeypox occurs.</p> \n<p>There is a risk that the vaccinia virus can be transmitted from the wound site to their close contacts. Those who are severely immunocompromised, who are pregnant, or who have eczema are most at risk, and can suffer serious adverse events either from being vaccinated or exposed to someone who has been. The risk of transmission from a vaccinated person to other people can be reduced by covering the injection site and good hygiene. The site is only infectious until scabbed over.</p> \n<p>The newer vaccine, known as Jynneos in Australia, does not carry the same risk and can be used in immunocompromised people and is also safe for pregnant women, children, and those with skin conditions. It is administered more easily, given in two doses four weeks apart, though people already vaccinated against smallpox in the past may only need one dose. It has fewer side effects than ACAM2000, and doesn’t require the same aftercare precautions.</p> \n<p>On 28 July Kelly announced the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) had made recommendations around how this newer vaccine should be used so that health workers are ready to administer it once supply is available in Australia. Kelly did not say when he expects the vaccine to be widely available, and Atagi advice states only that “limited supplies … have been secured by the Commonwealth and some states and territories,” though it is unclear if it has arrived in Australia yet.</p> \n<h2>Not everyone needs vaccination</h2> \n<p>Most healthy people recover from monkeypox within a few weeks, experiencing symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. In some cases, monkeypox may begin with a rash or sores in the mouth and on the face, which may then spread to other parts of the body.</p> \n<p>Severe illness and death is a risk in rare cases, particularly in immunocompromised people.</p> \n<p>ACAM2000 does protect against monkeypox. But according to Atagi, Jynneos is the preferred vaccine for these vulnerable groups, and it is also the preferred vaccine for use in people exposed to the virus and at risk of developing disease. Vaccination after exposure can prevent disease developing, known as post-exposure prophylaxis.</p> \n<p>Atagi advice states that “For healthy non-pregnant adults, where Jynneos is not suitable or not available, ACAM2000 has an established profile and may be considered” for those exposed to the virus or at high risk of exposure.</p> \n<p>The good news is monkeypox does not spread easily between people. You need close contact with the lesions, body fluids, or respiratory droplets through extended face-to-face contact with an infected person to be at risk.</p> \n<p>With a low number of cases in Australia, contact tracing is straightforward and infection risk is lower, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/15/monkeypox-australia-virus-what-are-symptoms-should-we-be-worried-cases-transmission-what-is-it\">high-risk communities especially are on alert</a>. Until at least the end of November, monkeypox is a notifiable disease in Australia, which means health authorities must be told of every case.</p> \n<h2>Who should get the vaccine?</h2> \n<p>In Atagi advice updated late July, the key risk groups recommended for vaccination include anyone who is a high risk monkeypox close contact within the past 14 days. High risk groups include gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who have a high number of sexual contacts are at the highest risk of monkeypox infection.</p> \n<p>Those living with HIV, a recent history of multiple sexual partners, participating in group sex, or attending sex on premises venues may also be considered for vaccination, the advice states. Those taking HIV prevention medication due to having a number of sexual partners may also be recommended for vaccination.</p> \n<p>Atagi states that sex workers, particularly those whose clients are in high-risk categories, and anyone in risk category planning travel to a country experiencing a significant outbreak, should also have vaccination recommended to them between four-to-six weeks prior to departure.</p> \n<p>Healthcare workers who will be administering ACAM200 can be offered either vaccine if they have not previously received a smallpox vaccine. Healthcare workers who will only be administering the Jynneos vaccine and otherwise have no anticipated occupational exposure to monkeypox are not routinely recommended for smallpox vaccination.</p> \n<p>For those health workers who have already received a smallpox vaccine in the past, a booster dose is recommended if the previous dose of a smallpox vaccine was given more than ten years prior.</p> \n<p>Vaccination is also being offered on a case-by-case basis to high-risk close contacts of monkeypox cases, such as household contacts and health workers.</p> \n<p>“Vaccination within four days of first exposure to an infectious case will provide the highest likelihood of prevention of disease,” Atagi says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/28/us-monkey-pox-vaccine-access-slow-spread\">US ramping up monkey pox vaccine distribution to slow down spread</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>I received a smallpox vaccination as a child.

Nosing between nettles, it felt its way over a fallen twig before turning back at the bank’s edge. Mother was close behind, and the baby embraced her with its forepaws as she squeaked reassurance.</p> <p>Even more exciting, the latest video evidence reveals that there are two kits in this litter. They are believed to be the first born in the county for 400 years, and are the offspring of a pair of Eurasian beavers (<em>Castor fiber</em>), reintroduced from Scotland as part of a <a href=\"https://www.dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk/what-we-do/wildlife-conservation/dorset-beaver-project\" title=\"\">five-year project managed by the Dorset Wildlife Trust</a>. In February 2021, an adult male and female were released into a large enclosure in a remote, marshy valley filled with alder and willow.</p> <p>The kits spent their first weeks inside the lodge, a massive, domed heap of branches and soil resembling a giant woody nest. The interior is above ground, but accessible only through an underwater passage. Purple loosestrife sprouts crazily from one side, its magenta spears the only streaks of colour in the thick green of late summer.</p> <p>Beavers like to hide by submerging themselves completely in deep, still water and they build dams to create the conditions that they need to feel safest. This pair has made four so far, creating a large pool around the lodge, plus three smaller ponds and gulleys.</p> <p>The dams are a complicated weave of dead twigs and branches infilled with fresh-cut hazel and wads of hemlock water dropwort (<em>Oenanthe crocata</em>). Using their strong forearms and hand-like paws, the adults have reinforced the structure with boulders, hunks of turf and slabs of mud, working around living trees and incorporating fallen trunks. Now about 55 metres long, the main construction provides a refuge and routeway for many creatures. Toads and newts nestle into its damp crevices, and wood mice, weasels and voles run across the top.</p> <p>My visit was supervised by the project officer Steve Oliver. He witnessed the speed with which the beavers have reshaped the landscape: “This was just one small pond, all silted up. On only their third night here they started collecting dead wood to plug a narrow pinch point – then the water poured over the land, transforming everything.

Wage growth is high by recent standards, he says, but not high enough to create an inflationary spiral.</p> <p>The Bank’s decision will also be affected by what it thinks is happening to underlying inflation, as measured by consumer prices excluding fuel, food, tobacco and alcohol. Here, the trend has been encouraging, with core inflation falling for two months in a row from 6.2% in April to 5.8% in June.</p> <p>Of more concern will be the steady increase in service-sector inflation, up from 0.7% in June 2021 to 5.2% in June. That will be seen as a sign of price pressures being generated in the domestic economy, rather than being imported from abroad.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at the ratings agency S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says surveys of manufacturing and services businesses show the economy is heading for a recession and that the debate is about how long and deep it will be. He says the Bank should be aware that a 0.5% increase in interest rates and a signal that the base rate is heading to 3% will shove the economy into an even deeper recession.</p> <p>Williamson is concerned that many of the indicators showing the economy performing well could reverse quickly should interest rates rise quickly. He warns this “bullwhip effect” could mean that business closures, which have remained low during the pandemic, become widespread, while unemployment, which has fallen steadily over the past year to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/17/uk-pay-inflation-unemployment-city-bonuses\">48-year low</a>, begins to rise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business Today email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The housing market, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/uk-house-prices-cost-of-living-crisis-price-rise\">proved resilient</a> since the beginning of the pandemic, could also begin to weaken and prices could begin to fall, pushing some households into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/16/sell-my-house-negative-equity-relocate\">negative equity</a>.</p> <p>Tim Bannister of the online real-estate portal Rightmove says first-time buyers are facing average monthly mortgage payments 20% higher than at the start of the year, due to rising interest rates and asking prices. Meanwhile, existing homeowners, many of them nearing the end of a fixed-rate mortgage, are having to pay higher monthly bills.</p> <p>“With each jump in interest rates, homeowners are contributing approximately 1% extra of their gross salary on average towards a mortgage, and a 0.5% increase in the base rate would take average monthly mortgage payments towards 40% of their salary,” he says.</p> <p>Another sign of an impending slump can be found in the warehouses of retailers, manufacturers and construction companies. For much of the past year, businesses have stockpiled raw materials and goods that are in short supply to guarantee they can fulfil contracts and supply customers.</p> <p>However, figures from the US show a collapse in consumer demand has left companies with mountains of unsold clothes, household goods and furniture. Inventories were high to support sales a few months ago.

This is an incredible challenge for kindergarten teachers, particularly when we know that families send their children to school before they are ready because school is more affordable than childcare. And we know this is a problem because one in five children are starting school developmentally vulnerable.</p> <p>Children effectively attending for an additional year (the year they turn five) will only benefit if the service they are attending is providing quality early learning programs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/16/what-the-new-year-of-preschool-education-means-for-parents-and-children\">What the new year of preschool education means for parents and children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The workforce crisis poses a significant threat to the quality of early education. Enrolments in early childhood teacher education course are declining and many early teachers choose to leave early childhood to work in a school where they can earn up to $30,000 more a year.</p> <p>The sector already needs an extra 7,000 early childhood teachers by 2024 if services are to meet regulatory requirements. The proposal has the potential to increase demand but from where the quality early childhood teacher workforce will come remains unclear.</p> <p>We need to think carefully about what such a proposal will mean for children in families experiencing disadvantage. We know that the children who stand to benefit most from attending a quality early education service are also the least likely to attend, even if they are enrolled. Affordability remains a key barrier. </p> <p>The NSW initiatives to improve children’s access to early education are welcome. But as these polices are rolled out the state government will need to ensure that not only are more children attending early learning services, but that the quality of these services is of the standard children need and deserve.</p> <p>• Assoc Prof Marianne Fenech is program director for early education at the University of Sydney and chair of the Australian Early Childhood Teacher Education Network</p> <h2>‘Parents must have the opportunity to decide’</h2> <p>I have three children who are vastly different in terms of their learning styles, skills and interests. My eldest knew her alphabet at 18 months old and was reading short picture books at four, and four years on she’s flourishing as one of the top students in her grade despite being born one day short of the cut-off. Holding her back, I believe, would have been detrimental to her potential. By contrast, my son will start school unable to identify more than a handful of letters despite the extensive efforts of both his parents and the staff at his preschool.</p> <p>I believe parents must have the opportunity to decide for themselves (within reason) the path that is right for their child. Of course, this all depends on what the government’s plan will actually look like for families, because at present the details are far from clear. </p> <p>While I understand the merits of raising the starting school age so more children are on an even footing when they begin, the reality is that no matter how they begin, the educational experiences of our children will never be equal. The difference in funding between public schools and private schools, the mass tutoring uptake by some families and the fact that some teachers are burnt-out and some families – due to work commitments or language/cultural barriers – can’t help their kids with homework will entrench inevitable differences.</p> <p>If the government plans to fund this program in its entirety, then it’s a conversation I’m willing to have. But having a child starting school is liberating for parents who are juggling care and work duties, often with workplaces who are not as progressive as they could be in terms of flexible working arrangements. The cost of childcare, which hits families hard without the added burdens of inflation and rising interest rates, must be addressed if we are planning on keeping our kids away from school another year. I have always firmly believed that the best place for the child is their family or their “village”, but life is less and less like a village these days and the fact that it is mostly disadvantaged families who send their kids to school before they’re ready because it saves childcare costs and frees parents up to work tells us that are there more pressing matters the state ought to address to even out our children’s lives. A lack of equality has a ripple effect.</p> <p>• Sarah Ayoub is a journalist, academic and author of books for young adults and children</p> <h2>‘This could reduce the wide age ranges in the classroom’</h2> <p>NSW students have some of the highest rates of delayed entrants in the world. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885200619300110\">Our research</a> suggests 25% of students start school in the year after they are eligible and, for those parents who have a choice in the matter (who have children born between January and July), 44% are delayed. As a consequence, children range in ages from four and a half to six in the first year of school. Children starting school at younger ages have lower levels of school readiness than older children and more socioeconomically advantaged parents are more likely to choose to delay, thus widening gaps in school readiness by socioeconomic status.</p> <p>Will raising the school age reduce these gaps? For many parents, having older children may mean that they are more likely to send their child to school on time. If the NSW government also reduces the opportunity to delay school start (from between January and July to, say, January and April, as in Victoria), this could reduce the wide age ranges in the classroom.</p> <p>• Ben Edwards is associate professor of child and youth development at the Australian National University</p> <h2>‘Early childhood education in NSW works as an un-equaliser’</h2> <p>Moving the school starting age to the year a child turns six is a great improvement to the situation in NSW but only if the government will keep its early promise to provide universal free public early childhood education (kindergarten) to all five-year-olds.</p> <p>Lifting the school starting age is part of much larger effort to improve lives of children in NSW. Research examining the benefits of starting formal schooling earlier is not consistent.Early childhood education in NSW works as an “un-equaliser” because it gives children from affluent and disadvantaged families very different conditions. If the NSW government goes about these changes the right way, they may act as much-needed improvements in educational equity.</p> <p>I would suggest the following three things be important in putting these reforms into practice.</p> <p>First, early childhood education (including primary school) needs to be designed in terms of a child’s rights. Play, wellbeing and whole-child development should be the key principles.</p> <p>Second, every five-year-old should have the right to attend a high-quality public preschool. It should be the government’s responsibility to make sure this right is protected, and that well-educated teachers and educators are working in every school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/jun/27/performance-pay-for-nsw-teachers-will-make-the-crisis-worse\">Performance pay for NSW teachers will make the crisis worse | Jessica Holloway, Rafaan Daliri-Ngametua and Sarah Langman for the Conversation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, the first years of primary school should be redesigned so that they provide a seamless, play-based transition from early childhood education.

Animals can be infected by inhaling, ingesting or direct contact with another animal, such as touching noses over a fence.</p> \n<p>The virus can also spread on wool, hair, grass or straw and by the wind. Any mud or manure sticking to footwear, clothing, livestock equipment or vehicle tyres can also spread the disease.</p> \n<p>It most commonly spreads during the movement of animals, for example between farms or from farms to sale yards and processing facilities.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/14/sign-up-for-rural-network-guardian-australia-email-newsletter-about-regional-affairs?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-rural-network\" name=\"the-rural-network\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-rural-network\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-rural-network\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pigs are “amplifying hosts”, excreting very large quantities of virus from their breath. Animals can carry the virus for months or years after apparent recovery.</p> \n<p>Sheep can have mild symptoms but this also makes them an important source of infection if the disease is not picked up early.</p> \n<p>Animals can recover but there is no treatment or cure.</p> \n<h2>Can FMD spread to humans?</h2> \n<p>Human infections are very rare and do not result in serious disease. But we can carry the virus in our nose for up to 24 hours and infect animals.</p> \n<p>FMD should not be confused with hand, foot-and-mouth disease commonly seen in children. The two diseases are different and are caused by different organisms.</p> \n<h2>What is the history of foot-and-mouth disease in Australia?</h2> \n<p>There have been minor outbreaks of possible FMD in Australia in 1801, 1804, 1871 and 1872.</p> \n<p>But there have been outbreaks globally, including in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. Different strains of virus tend to dominate in different parts of the globe. The UK suffered a major outbreak in 2001 which cost the economy £8bn.</p> \n<h2>What happens if foot-and-mouth enters Australia?</h2> \n<p>According to the federal department of agriculture, the probability of “an internationally notifiable outbreak of FMD” occurring within the next five years in Australia has been increased from 9% to 11.6% (with a range of 3%-20.5%).</p> \n<p>The policy for foot-and-mouth disease response across the country, governed by the <a href=\"https://animalhealthaustralia.com.au/ausvetplan/\">Ausvetplan</a> disease manual, would mean infected properties would be quarantined within at least a 3km radius.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/03/foot-and-mouth-disease-could-devastate-australias-economy-heres-what-can-be-done\">Foot and mouth disease could devastate Australia’s economy.

Some 95% of Australian mutton (sheep meat) is sold to export as well as 65% of Australian lamb.</p> \n<p>“We would lose access to export markets straight away so the producers not impacted by a cull would need to sell domestically, which could see [downward] pressure on the price,” Dalgleish says.</p> \n<h2>How can travellers ensure they don’t spread the disease?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/travelling/to-australia/advice-to-travellers#footandmouth-disease\">Tourists and returning travellers</a> should make sure all clothing, footwear and equipment has been thoroughly cleaned, particularly of mud, soil and manure.

As of 4 August 2022 it has spread to 23 of Indonesia’s 37 provinces, including Bali, a hotspot for Australian tourists.</p> \n<p>The disease has mainly been detected in cattle and among the smallholder farms that form 90% of Indonesia’s cattle industry. Prof Peter Windsor, an expert in livestock health at the University of Sydney, describes smallholder farms as mostly “dairy farms in back yards”. According to a <a href=\"https://fapet.ugm.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/sites/1211/2018/03/AJAS-18-0233_Proof-file_2.Widi_.confirmed.pdf\">2018 study on the cattle industry</a> in Indonesia, there are 6.5 million farmers in rural areas and 16.6 million cattle.</p> \n<p>Ferdinandus Rondong, head of portfolio at Prisma, an organisation in Indonesia that supports smallholder farmers, said the rate of FMD infections had continued to drop since the beginning of July.</p> \n<p>But Windsor said: “They say about half a million animals infected but you can probably put another zero on the end of that because we know the levels of reporting are always low.”</p> \n<h2><strong>What is Indonesia doing to stem the spread of FMD?</strong></h2> \n<p>The Indonesian government launched a nationwide rollout of vaccinations in mid-June. It has also restricted the movement of livestock with the help of police and the army, launched a campaign to educate farmers on the risks of FMD, and a number of infected livestock have been slaughtered.</p> \n<p>As of 4 August just over 992,000 livestock have been vaccinated, 7,702 animals have been slaughtered and 4,847 have died.</p> \n<p>On 19 July, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s FMD taskforce, Prof Wiku Adisasmito, told an online press conference that vaccination efforts were being hampered by a lack of supply and people to administer vaccines, as well as difficulties getting to farmers and keeping the vaccine at the correct temperature.</p> \n<p>But in a recent briefing, Adisasmito said Indonesia is forging ahead with vaccinations and aims to get the outbreak under control by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>“We hope by the end of this year, we can control the situation by having the number of cases reported reduced from time to time,” he said. “We would also reassure the international community that Indonesia is capable of controlling the outbreak.”</p> \n<p>According to the Red Cross, the government has stated 30 million vaccines are needed. But so far only 3m vaccines have been secured, with an additional 1m expected to arrive in Indonesia from Australia soon. The Indonesian government is planning to produce vaccines locally, with production expected to start by the end of August.</p> \n<p>Rondong said controls restricting the movement of cattle between islands had been weak, with the spread likely exacerbated by Idul Adha, <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/indonesia/2022/06/30/govt-steps-up-fmd-containment-efforts-ahead-of-idul-adha.html\">a major Islamic holiday on 10 July </a>which involves the sacrifice of animals and sharing the meat with the poor.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is Australia doing?</strong></h2> \n<p>Enhanced biosecurity controls have been put in place at Indonesia’s borders with a particular focus on Bali, according to a spokesperson for Australia’s department of agriculture. The controls include disinfectant foot mats for departing passengers and awareness raising materials.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/foot-and-mouth-disease-australia-2022-what-is-fmd-why-so-bad-symptoms-signs-animals-cattle-sheep\">Foot-and-mouth disease Australia: what is FMD and what happens if it enters the country?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Both the Australian and New Zealand governments have ramped up biosecurity controls domestically, including strict screening of inbound mail and freight from Indonesia.</p> \n<p>The Australian government has committed A$5m (US$3.46m) to support Indonesia’s response, as well as mitigation measures in Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea where the disease has not yet been detected. The money will fund testing, personnel and logistics support for the distribution of vaccine.</p> \n<h2><strong>Are farmers being compensated?</strong></h2> \n<p>The government is preparing a compensation scheme for affected farmers, with Rp10,000,000 (about A$960) for each forced slaughter. But a spokesperson for the Red Cross said there were concerns this was not enough for farmers to recoup their loss, with cattle often as valuable as farmers’ houses.</p> \n<p>Windsor said that unlike the FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom, where livestock were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/03/foot-and-mouth-disease-could-devastate-australias-economy-heres-what-can-be-done\">culled to get the disease under control</a>, forced slaughter is difficult in south-east Asian countries given livestock are the “bank accounts for smallholder farmers”, and also a crucial source of nutrition for rural Indonesian children.</p> \n<p>In mid-July, Windsor visited two farms in Indonesia where animals had been infected with FMD. In one farm of 18 cows, milk production had dropped from an average of 250 litres a day to 15 litres.</p> \n<p>“It has a massive impact on productivity for the farms,” he said. “And they are very concerned for the animals suffering from the disease.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/04/eddie-betts-the-afl-great-who-overcame-so-much-with-no-hint-of-bitterness","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T02:13:44Z","webTitle":"Eddie Betts: the AFL great who overcame so much with no hint of bitterness | Jonathan Horn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/eddie-betts-the-afl-great-who-overcame-so-much-with-no-hint-of-bitterness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/04/eddie-betts-the-afl-great-who-overcame-so-much-with-no-hint-of-bitterness","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Betts: the AFL great who overcame so much with no hint of bitterness","trailText":"The former player’s autobiography details his experience of Adelaide’s 2018 camp and reveals a man who found his voice in the face of adversity","byline":"Jonathan Horn","body":"<p>Eddie Betts’ grandfather died on the floor of a Port Lincoln prison cell.

When he was eight years old, he was already being harassed by the Kalgoorlie police – “the <em>monarch” </em>is what local Indigenous people called them<em>. </em>He was arrested for stealing a spoon. “It was a reality for us,” he writes in his autobiography, which was released this week. “It was an expectation.” Family violence and alcohol abuse were rife. The intergenerational side effects of colonialism and the stolen generation shaped him. “We became experts on managing situations, reading people, and diffusing tension.”</p> <p>He was raised with strong female influences, and never went without. Family, culture and sport were everything. When he moved to Melbourne, he could barely read or write. He was aching for home, and for his community. His first AFL coach was Denis Pagan, a ferocious figure. His first opponent was Glenn Archer, one of the toughest footballers to play the game. His first goal of the year award netted him a Toyota Aurion. Shortly after, he was pulled over by two police officers, demanding to know whose car he was driving.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/03/adelaide-crows-apologise-to-afl-great-eddie-betts-for-camp-trauma\">Adelaide Crows apologise to AFL great Eddie Betts for camp trauma</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Few football images are more indelibly etched than that of Betts crammed in a forward pocket at the Adelaide Oval – his eyes dancing, his shorts in danger of sliding off, his opponents tottering drunkenly at his feet. Few footballers could inspire two sets of cheer squads to chant his name. Few footballers could kick a 50-metre reverse torpedo goal, on their wrong foot, from about six rows back, and explain it with a straight face – “I just make stuff up.”</p> <p>The main talking point from his book however, concerns the Adelaide Crows camp in 2018. Later that season, the two directors who had facilitated the camp conducted a press conference at the MCG. “We now consider the matter closed,” one of them said. But it was never going to go away. Reading Betts’s recollections of the mind training, one is struck by how utterly demented it was – how pointless, how infantile.</p> <p>It was the complete antithesis of what Richmond, West Coast and Collingwood were doing during that period. At Adelaide, they practised their facial expressions as they ran through the banner. They’d scream “Fuck you!” at one another, thrusting their groins and maintaining eye contact. And then there was the Power Stance – chest out, arms straight, fists clenched. They looked like idiots. It was straight from the sandpit. The Richmond players, who were lined up opposite, were laughing at them. They eschewed all the bullshit, kept their cool as the Crows jumped to an early lead, and gradually ground them to dust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53591f87730bca435f080937305dc6bf63b33e75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53591f87730bca435f080937305dc6bf63b33e75/0_0_3594_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Betts in full flight at Adelaide Oval in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Betts in full flight at Adelaide Oval in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Brake/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We can laugh at how ridiculous and self-defeating it was. The camp, however, was no laughing matter. Betts claims in the book that the stunts included the airing of confidential information from a private counselling session, and the co-opting of Aboriginal cultural rituals. At one point one of the men was screaming at Betts, telling him what a shit father he was because he’d been raised by his mother. Betts was left paranoid, angry, “weirdly secretive”, “snappy at the kids” and out of the Crows’ leadership group.</p> <p>The camp wore heavily on Eddie Betts. But he also found his voice. “Being Black,” he writes, “I have no choice but to be political in order to survive in Australia.” Every time there’s a racist slur, it’s Aboriginal footballers like Betts who do the heavy lifting, the consoling, the explaining, the forgiving. Every time there’s one of these incidents, we get a sense of their fury, their exhaustion. Every time, you suspect, it takes another piece of them.</p> <p>“Hopefully Eddie’s getting over that,” the Crows football director said on Triple M on Wednesday. There was an instant defensiveness there, a tonal readjustment that was totally predictable, really tedious, and very Australian. His CEO, who wasn’t at the club when the camp took place, at least had the decency to apologise.</p> <p>Eddie Betts may never get over “that”. But there’s not a skerrick of bitterness or resentment in him, or in his book. Aboriginal people have lit Olympic flames, captained Australian rugby teams, won world title fights and triumphed at Wimbledon.

According to Chinese state media, three of the six live-fire drills will overlap with sea Taiwan claims is its territory. Ahead of the exercises, which are due to begin on Thursday, Taiwan said 27 Chinese warplanes had entered its air defence zone.</p> \n<p>Taiwan has never been part of the People’s Republic of China and says it is already a sovereign nation with no need to declare independence. It wishes to maintain the safety of the status quo and does not want a conflict, but has said it will defend itself.</p> \n<p>Taiwan’s defence ministry called China’s planned exercises an aerial and maritime blockade of Taiwan.</p> \n<p>“This is a big deal given a blockade is a legal act of war,” said Indo-Pacific defence policy expert Blake Herzinger. “I think it needs to be signalled to Taiwan that this is not the time to inflame things further.”</p> \n<p>This week, Taiwan has also been hit by a series of cyber-attacks though it is not yet clear who was responsible.

In this case, they are designed to show the level of force China could unleash against Taiwan if Beijing decided to seize control of the island.</p> \n<p>Experts agree that neither the US nor China have the appetite for the tension to escalate to war. According to Justin Bassi, executive director for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, China’s military exercises will probably be calibrated to avoid escalation from the US.</p> \n<p>Herzinger said the US has been very careful to not express support for Taiwan’s independence given that is China’s “red line”.</p> \n<p>“In the US engagement with Taiwan, they’re always careful to ensure they find the right balance between supporting Taiwan, but without emboldening Taiwan to do something that would cause a larger conflict,” he said.</p> \n<p>Amanda Hsiao, a senior analyst for China at the Crisis Group, said while China’s military escalation is concerning, it is not an unexpected response.</p> \n<p>“Beijing is clearly trying to express it’s resolute objections to Pelosi’s visit,” she said “And that means that the military response that it chooses right now has to visibly escalate above military activities that it has previously engaged in around Taiwan, and that baseline is pretty high.</p> \n<p>“I think the intention of the military drills is more likely to posture and demonstrate military strength,” she said.</p> \n<p>China’s Global Times newspaper said on Wednesday the drills were aimed at showing that China’s military is “capable of blockading the entire island”.</p> \n<h2><strong>Has the situation been this tense before?</strong></h2> \n<p>There have been several crises in the Taiwan Strait, most recently in 1995. That incident was known as the Third Strait of Taiwan Crisis and followed the island’s announcement that it would hold its first democratic presidential elections. China flexed its military muscle with months of military drills, including firing missiles 35 miles from Taiwan’s ports.</p> \n<p>While there is a history of military displays in the Taiwan strait, Hsiao said it appears missile tests planned by China in response to Pelosi’s visit will be closer to the island this time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/duandang/status/1554502805582295040\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">China's military exercises around Taiwan in August 2022 and March 1996 (Third Taiwan Strait crisis).

Yet some experts say Xi’s response to Pelosi’s visit is likely to be as much about domestic issues in China as it is about asserting power. Mainland China is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/china-property-sales-could-plunge-by-one-third-analysts-say-as-crisis-deepens\">plagued by an unfolding property crisis</a> that has provoked protests, and economic slowdown resulting from its strict zero-Covid policy and continued lockdowns. </p> \n<p>“When it comes to Pelosi’s visit it may perhaps be an opportunity for Xi Jinping to sort of turn the lens away from domestic issues and focus outward as a method of distraction,” said Jennifer Hsu, a research fellow at Australia’s Lowy Institute.</p> \n<p>According to Jade Guan, an expert in China’s foreign policy at Deakin University, Xi’s actions to look strong on Taiwan and against the US are also likely influenced by the upcoming 20th National Congress, a meeting that occurs every five years to announce major leadership changes.</p> \n<p>“[Xi] projects himself as the protector of China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, of which Taiwan is a central part,” Guan said.</p> \n<p>“So Xi’s administration cannot afford to look weak before [National Congress].”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/04/saudi-sisters-found-dead-in-sydney-told-acquaintance-queer-women-live-in-fear-in-their-homeland","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T01:59:50Z","webTitle":"Saudi sisters found dead in Sydney told acquaintance queer women ‘live in fear’ in their homeland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/saudi-sisters-found-dead-in-sydney-told-acquaintance-queer-women-live-in-fear-in-their-homeland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/saudi-sisters-found-dead-in-sydney-told-acquaintance-queer-women-live-in-fear-in-their-homeland","fields":{"headline":"Saudi sisters found dead in Sydney told acquaintance queer women ‘live in fear’ in their homeland","trailText":"<strong>Exclusive:</strong> Guardian understands sisters attended girls-only queer event and police are investigating if one or both feared being persecuted for their sexuality","byline":"Joshua Mcdonald, Mostafa Rachwani and Ben Doherty","body":"<p>Two Saudi sisters found dead in their beds in Sydney attended a girls-only queer event in January where they told acquaintances gay women “live in fear” in Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands New South Wales police are investigating whether one or both of the sisters may have feared being persecuted for their sexuality in their homeland, which they fled together in 2017 for Australia, where they made claims for asylum.</p> \n<p>The bodies of Asra Abdullah Alsehli, 24, and Amaal Abdullah Alsehli, 23, were found in their beds in their apartment in Canterbury on 7 June.

The source of this debris is often from comets, which have long orbits around the sun.</p> <p>“Like my cat, comets shed bits,” says Professor Orsola De Marco of Macquarie University. “These bits remain pretty much in orbit – so imagine a very elongated orbit that’s full of little bits.”</p> <p>When the Earth crosses the path of a comet’s orbit, it encounters this debris. “It’s like when you are driving your car through a cloud of insects – you get them all in your windshield,” De Marco said.</p> <p>The debris burns up as it enters Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in dazzling displays across the sky.</p> <p>The Perseids are associated with the comet Swift–Tuttle. The Southern Delta Aquariids come from the comet 96P/Machholz, while the parent body of the Alpha Capricornids is the comet 169P/NEAT. Astronomers have not yet found where the Piscis Austrinids originate from.</p> <p>A meteor shower is named after the nearest constellation to the radiant, the point in the sky which the shower appears to come from. The radiant of the Southern Delta Aquariids, for example, is close to the star Delta Aquarii, in the constellation Aquarius.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>When and where is the best time to view the meteor showers?</h2> <p><strong>Perseid meteor shower: peaks 13 August</strong></p> <p>While the meteor showers are visible from everywhere on Earth, the Perseids are best viewed from the northern hemisphere.</p> <p>The dazzling Perseids meteor shower is expected to peak on 13 August. At its peak, there can be more than 100 meteors an hour.</p> <p>The radiant of this meteor shower is very close to the horizon, De Marco says. “You’re going to see [meteors] going upwards from the north horizon. They’re going to look like they are rising as opposed to falling.”</p> <p>In Australia, the best viewing will be towards the north at 5am on 13 August.

The three meteor showers are active until mid-August.</p> <p>The Southern Delta Aquariids peaked on 30 July . This shower has the quickest meteors of the three.

The 28-year-old, whose family fled Sudan’s civil war when he was four, has coped with the stress that comes with competing against the best in a gruelling event for the past decade.</p> <p>There have been moments of brilliance, with his fourth-placed finish in the Tokyo Olympics last year an illustration. More recently, a seventh in the world championships was deflating. On Tuesday, when he rolled an ankle ahead of his appearance in a heat of the 800m in Birmingham, Bol would have been forgiven for fearing the worst.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/commonwealth-games-day-six-roundup-australia\">Ariarne Titmus and Australia’s swimmers wrap up golden Commonwealth Games </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead he focused. He iced the ankle. Put the feet up. Iced the joint again. And again. It was a professional approach to a scare. He planned to fight on, no matter the pain. But it was not until Wednesday morning that he was convinced he would produce his best. Walking 800m on a dodgy ankle is painful, let alone running it. But Bol pulled it off with brilliance when clocking a time of 1:47.01 to qualify the fastest for Sunday’s final at Alexander Stadium.</p> <p>“I rolled my ankle yesterday and I was limping on the way back and today I’m perfectly fine, so it’s a massive thanks to the medical team at Athletics Australia,” he said. “I wasn’t playing basketball, I promise. I just rolled it on the curb at the track. That’s the first time ever. It was getting better by the night and then in the morning, I was like, ‘Bam, I’m ready to go’.”</p> <p>The ease with which he claimed the heat is testament to this. Bol trailed Kenyan Cornelius Tuwai, who has a faster personal best than the Western Australian, for the first 550m before dispatching with him to cruise to the line.</p> <p>“To be honest, I did feel at ease and I enjoyed that a lot,” he said. “It was awesome to come back from the world’s, because it was a disappointing final, so to come back here and be in amazing shape and just switch off like that at the end is amazing.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, five-time Paralympic gold medallist Evan O’Hanlon successfully defended the T37/38 100m title he claimed four years ago on the Gold Coast with a time of 11.23 seconds in the final.</p> <p>O’Hanlon, who has twice retired from the track during his lengthy and decorated career but returned to win bronze at the Tokyo Paralympics, said he hoped could further add to his medal collection at the Games in 2024. “I would like to keep running. I know if I was training at the same level, I was before London and Rio that I feel like I could win gold again in Paris,” he said.</p> <p>Rohan Browning was left disappointed after finishing sixth in the men’s 100m final with a time of 10.20 – 0.10s slower than the time he laid down in the heats, which would have been enough for him to take silver in the final.

That’s what it’s all about.</p> <p>“I thought about packing it in after worlds and just getting back home and into some training for next year and I am glad I decided to persist. I think one of the lessons I have learned is persistence is so much more important than patience. You have just got to keep trying things and keep at it.</p> <p>“Today there were a few things I could have done to be up there but I think I was bested today.

Meanwhile, creating the new National Science and Technology Council and the Office for Science and Technology Strategy – on top of existing bodies such as UK Research and Innovation – threatened to make bureaucracy even worse, he said.</p> <p>“The government’s plan to become a science superpower is great, but at the moment it feels like setting off on a marathon with your shoelaces tied together and no signposts telling you how to get to the finishing line,” Krebs said. “There is a danger the UK becomes a bureaucracy superpower rather than a science superpower.”</p> <p>The Cabinet Office said last year that cutting-edge science and technology was “essential” to the country’s prosperity in the digital age, and declared its ambition for the UK to become a “<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy\">science and tech superpower</a>” by 2030. The goal builds on a pledge to boost research and development funds to 2.4% of GDP by 2027. This requires <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04223/\">reversing a trend</a> that saw funding fall from 1.84% of GDP to 1.74% between 1985 and 2019.</p> <p>Lady Brown, the chair of the Lords committee, said while the government had “high ambitions” for science and technology, the inquiry found a “plethora of strategies” in different areas with little linking them together. Meanwhile, numerous official bodies had ill-defined or overlapping responsibilities, and it was often unclear who was accountable for what.</p> <p>More than a dozen strategies and initiatives linked to research and innovation were launched in the life sciences alone between 2017 and 2021, the inquiry heard, leading to what Krebs called a “confusing landscape” and suspicions that the government might be better at writing new strategies than delivering them.</p> <p>The report urges the government to be specific about what it wants to achieve and to publish a clear implementation plan with measurable goals. It calls for closer work with business to reach the 2.4% of GDP target and the urgent appointment of a new science minister at cabinet level.

agency Trisonic.</p> <p>“The commercial sector has deep pockets and invested heavily, there is better quality programming and more marketing than ever, spin-off stations of brands such as Absolute and Kiss have worked well and national talent that once would have stayed at the BBC is now being hosted increasingly on commercial radio.”</p> <p>In February, Global Radio, owner of stations ranging from Capital and Heart to Classic FM, once again flexed its financial muscle by <a

racehorses.</p> <p>Six years ago Rupert Murdoch moved to become a force in UK radio by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/30/rupert-murdochs-news-corp-buys-talksport-owner-in-220m-deal\">paying £220m for the Wireless Group</a>, home to brands including Virgin Radio and TalkSport, with star signings including Evans, Jeremy Kyle and Trisha Goddard.</p> <p>Murdoch’s News UK has since launched new services TalkRadio and TimesRadio, stablemate to the Times newspapers.</p> <p>The third major player is German-owned Bauer, which runs stations including Jazz FM, Magic, Kiss and Absolute.</p> <p>“Global Radio, Bauer and News UK, these super media groups have invigorated the commercial radio sector,” said Bareham.</p> <p>“They are all private companies, not hampered by being public, and can therefore invest for the long term. The commercial industry has been on the tail of the BBC in terms of listening hours for some years, it has been coming.”</p> <p>The commercial radio sector passed the BBC in terms of weekly reach – the number of listeners - back in the last quarter of 2015. The latest figures show that on average 32.9 million listeners tune into BBC radio each week, while 36.2 million listen to commercial stations.</p> <p>Worryingly for the BBC, commercial radio stations also continue to substantially outperform the public broadcaster among listeners aged under 45. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/04/almost-6m-uk-households-struggling-to-pay-telecoms-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T23:01:39Z","webTitle":"Almost 6m UK households ‘struggling to pay telecoms bills’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/almost-6m-uk-households-struggling-to-pay-telecoms-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/04/almost-6m-uk-households-struggling-to-pay-telecoms-bills","fields":{"headline":"Almost 6m UK households ‘struggling to pay telecoms bills’","trailText":"Which? says people are cutting food and clothes spending to pay for mobile, broadband and landline","byline":"Mark Sweney","body":"<p>Almost 6 million UK households are struggling to pay their mobile, landline and broadband bills, with the cost of living squeeze forcing many to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/24/retail-sales-fall-as-shoppers-in-great-britain-cut-back-on-food-spending\">cut back on essentials such as food and clothes</a>, cancel or change a service, or miss payments to stay connected.</p> <p>A report from the consumer group Which? estimates that 5.7 million households have experienced at least one “affordability issue” in April, as cash-strapped homes struggle to cope with soaring bills and other costs. </p> <p>Consumers are increasingly coming under pressure from the cost of living crisis – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/22/uk-inflation-rises-to-91-its-highest-rate-in-40-years#:~:text=British%20households%20are%20facing%20the,the%20soaring%20cost%20of%20food.\">inflation is at a 40-year high</a> and energy bills are forecast to soar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/energy-bills-great-britain-winter-discount\">£3,600 annually this winter </a>– more households are finding it harder to afford the essential telecoms services they previously took for granted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/01/one-in-seven-uk-loyalty-penalty-broadband-phone-citizens-advice\">One in seven consumers in UK paying ‘loyalty penalty’, says charity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Analysing data from the regulator Ofcom, Which? found that 3.5 million homes reduced spending on other essential items such as food and clothes in April to afford their telecoms bills.

And when they are bad, they are relegation-grade fodder. Since Ralph Hasenhüttl pitched up in late 2018, the problem is that you never know which version you’re going to get. Unfortunately, that’s about the most exciting bit about being a Southampton fan right now.</p> \n<p>After failing to replace Danny Ings at the start of last season, Southampton took 10 matches to win their first game, and finished the campaign with a worse goal difference (-24) than relegated Burnley, with only a prosperous period in February keeping the club above the drop zone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b976da56-5d8d-48c1-bef7-7562c07289de\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tKmf4Q7MWXM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Transfers have been wayward for a while – the idea of Saints having a player good enough to sell to Liverpool these days seems a little far-fetched. This summer’s transfer policy of paying more than £23m for Manchester City academy players seems a little risky until you remember the success of both Tino Livramento and Armando Broja (from Chelsea) last season. If Southampton do one thing well, it’s spot a good youngster. It’s the rest of the recruitment you have to worry about.</p> \n<p>Much depends on the fitness and form of captain James Ward-Prowse – top scorer (11 goals) and creator in chief (eight assists) last year – as well as whether they can find a goalscorer. Broja has gone back to Chelsea, Che Adams has had a mixed time while Adam Armstrong has failed to fill Danny Ings’ shoes after the latter left for Aston Villa a year ago.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/southampton/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>“After spending time with Hasenhüttl, I can say I really like him and he’s really smart.” So said the club’s new owner, Dragan Solak, upon taking over in January. Solak spoke about building a top-10 team, but the likelihood is Hasenhüttl will again be fighting relegation as this is a squad that needed an overhaul, not a tweak. Heavy defeats are not limited to the 9-0s: Southampton finished last season with two draws and 10 losses in 13 matches, with five of those defeats being by a margin of at least three goals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64f33a3368e2f6d5c7cf94ce61e49127b77ec296\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64f33a3368e2f6d5c7cf94ce61e49127b77ec296/14_171_3896_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roméo Lavia is a signing that has gone under the radar somewhat, but the Belgian teenager was highly-rated at Manchester City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roméo Lavia is a signing that has gone under the radar somewhat, but the Belgian teenager was highly-rated at Manchester City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Many balked at the initial £12m deal for Roméo Lavia, an 18-year-old who had made just two senior appearances for Manchester City. But this is a player highly-rated by Pep Guardiola. Lavia was the sole teenage member of City’s academy to be named on their 21-strong squad for last season’s Champions League group stage and the Premier League champions have included a £40m buy-back clause in the deal with Saints. A defensive midfielder, the Belgian will provide competition for Oriol Romeu but has a better passing range and is more mobile than the Spaniard. Expect to see plenty of the youngster.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>Southampton have only a few absences, but the biggest issue will be in defence. Jan Bednarek (and new goalkeeper Mateusz Lis) will be on duty for Poland while Mohammed Salisu has quietly been developing into one of the most progressive centre-backs in the Premier League and the uncapped Ghanaian has finally been convinced to turn out for the Black Stars after saying he wanted to focus on his club career last year. Ward-Prowse has a chance of getting an England call-up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-04:18:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"v\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-04:18:16/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>You could do a lot worse than skip town and head across the River Test into the New Forest. Or it’s a quick hop on the ferry to the Isle of Wight, which hosts festivals for music, classic cars and even garlic. The latter includes the famous Lamb National, in which sheep race around a circuit with toy jockeys on their backs.</p> \n<h2>Leading the shirt sales</h2> \n<p>Who else but “the best free-kick taker in the world”, according to Pep Guardiola: Ward-Prowse. The Portsmouth-born captain joined the Saints at the age of eight, and he has carried his side on his back for the last 12 months. The only issues with getting <em>his</em> name on the back of <em>your</em> shirt is a) how expensive all those letters are going to be b) if Ward-Prowse leaves before the transfer window shuts. Despite signing a new five-year deal last year, Tottenham and West Ham continue to be linked with him this summer.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>Not even the club can beat Theo Walcott’s 2.8m followers on Instagram, but one suspects this is more to do with an Arsenal hangover than any ‘content’ the 33-year-old is punting into the ether. The best thing about this corner of the internet is that people have (largely) stopped listening to the conspiracy nonsense that Matt Le Tissier has been spewing out on his various social channels.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed–overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed–the-fiver\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>If Netflix did a Southampton doc …</h2> \n<p>There is probably a very sensible documentary to be made on Southampton’s academy, with Gareth Bale, Walcott, Adam Lallana, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers all breaking into the first team in the not-so-distant past. However, I think most people would rather watch a feature-length ‘film’ of another academy graduate, Ward-Prowse, just taking free-kicks. Eighty-five minutes of the skipper whipping it top bins?

They found that people who had been vaccinated against HPV had a 57% lower risk of high-grade preinvasive disease (CIN2+) recurring than those who had not had the jab.</p> <p>The risk was reduced by even more – 74% – when the chances of CIN2+ recurring were assessed for HPV16 and HPV18, the two types of the virus that cause many cases of cervical cancer.</p> <p>However, the authors stressed that the evidence for those reductions was “inconclusive” and that large-scale randomised control trials were needed to confirm that vaccination conferred that benefit.</p> <p>“We are pleased to see emerging research into the value of using the HPV vaccine to prevent the recurrence of cervical cell changes, and look forward to seeing further large-scale studies into the effectiveness of this method,” said Eluned Hughes, head of information and engagement at Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust.</p> <p>While HPV jabs had cut cases of cervical cancer by 87% since 2008, women over 27, who could not get it, are still at increased risk of developing the disease.</p> <p>Alice Davies, a health information manager at Cancer Research UK, was cautious about the findings.</p> <p>“This study looked at whether the HPV vaccine can stop further cell changes happening after people have had treatment to remove abnormal cells caused by HPV infection. But it’s still too early to say if using the vaccine in this way is beneficial, and larger high-quality studies and trials are needed.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/03/echr-rejects-last-chance-appeal-from-parents-of-archie-battersbee","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T22:25:17Z","webTitle":"Archie Battersbee: parents say they will fight to move him to a hospice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/03/echr-rejects-last-chance-appeal-from-parents-of-archie-battersbee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/03/echr-rejects-last-chance-appeal-from-parents-of-archie-battersbee","fields":{"headline":"Archie Battersbee: parents say they will fight to move him to a hospice","trailText":"Parents of 12-year-old say they should be allowed to choose where their son takes ‘his last moments’","byline":"Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent and agency","body":"<p>The parents of 12-year-old Archie Battersbee have pledged to “fight” to get him moved to a hospice, insisting they should be allowed to choose where he takes “his last moments”.</p> <p>After the rejection by the European court of human rights of their last-ditch bid to postpone the withdrawal of Archie’s life support, the family now intends to file an application to the high court in London to transfer him out of the Royal London hospital.</p> <p>His mother, Hollie Dance, said she felt “absolutely deflated” after the decision on Wednesday evening by the Strasbourg court not to intervene in the case.</p> <p>A family spokesperson told the PA news agency that Barts Health NHS trust, which runs the hospital, said Archie’s life support will be withdrawn at 11am on Thursday unless a legal application regarding the hospice move is submitted by 9am. She confirmed the family intend to submit such an application, describing it as “completely barbaric and absolutely disgusting that we’re not even allowed to choose where Archie takes his last moments”.</p> <p>The child has been in a coma since he was found unconscious in April and is being kept alive by a combination of medical interventions, including ventilation and drug treatments.</p> <p>The trust has said Archie’s condition is too unstable for a transfer and that moving him by ambulance to a different setting “would most likely hasten the premature deterioration the family wish to avoid, even with full intensive care equipment and staff on the journey”.</p> <p>A high court order made in July requires that Archie remains at the Royal London hospital while his treatment is withdrawn.</p> <p>The family’s spokesperson said a hospice has agreed to take him, adding: “Hospices are well and truly designed for palliative and respite care. Archie is now obviously on palliative care so there is no reason whatsoever for him not to take his last moments at a hospice.”</p> <p>Dance said she wanted her son to have a “dignified passing at a hospice”, adding that is “unfair” they have to “fight” to get him out of the hospital. Becoming tearful as she gave her reaction to the human rights court’s decision, she said: “The one thing I will say is, I promised him I’d fight to the end and that’s exactly what I’ve done.”</p> <p>Dance and Archie’s father, Paul Battersbee, had applied to the Strasbourg court for “interim measures” – urgent action ordered by the court in exceptional cases where there is an imminent risk of irreparable harm.</p> <p>Such measures usually involve the applicant asking for suspension of an expulsion or an extradition while the case is considered, as in the case where the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/14/european-court-humam-right-makes-11th-hour-intervention-in-rwanda-asylum-seeker-plan\">first deportation flight to Rwanda was halted</a>.

Its plot is a blend of cliches, its set design somewhere between serviceable and cheap, its acting either solidly watchable or borderline parody. It rearranges deeply familiar tropes into easy listening. It depicts a community in the US with enough knowledge to feel grounded and respectful, but with enough frivolity and romance to cater to, naturally, the global audience. Because of or despite these things, it’s baseline enjoyable to watch, its entertainment value less in how it makes you think or feel and more in how easy it is to submit to floating along the emotional current.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/03/luck-review-pound-shop-pixar-is-a-short-straw-for-young-audiences\">Luck review – pound-shop Pixar is a short straw for young audiences</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Directed by Shanghai Noon’s Tom Dey and written by Shiwani Srivastava, it could be described as the Netflix series Indian Matchmaking crossed with Hulu’s Four Wedding and a Funeral remake, mixed with the Netflix hit Never Have I Ever (one of the first shows to feature the child of Indian immigrants as a quintessential American teenager, created by Mindy Kaling), and shot through with the classic romcom ploy of deceptive courtship. It is more than that sum, although composed of obvious parts.</p> <p>We open with thirty something Asha (Pallavi Sharda) falling asleep on her couch surrounded by a comic amount of noodle containers, rushing late to a meeting, spending the night at her office – she’s the stubborn workaholic, secretly lonely shrew to be tamed. Asha has one foot in the mainstream American careerist world – she worked as a banker and left to be in micro-finance, the details of which are as vaguely sketched as the advertising in Emily in Paris, Netflix’s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/emily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv\">ambience TV</a> par excellence – and one foot in the traditional Indian American world of her parents. Panicked that her daughter will be single for her younger sister Priya’s (Arianna Afsar) wedding to Nick (Sean Kleier), a white man trying embarrassingly hard to ingratiate himself to Indian Hindu traditions, Asha’s mother, Suneeta (Veena Sood), poses as Asha online and sets up a date.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqqTL91J1lo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xqqTL91J1lo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ravi, played endearingly by Suraj Sharma (Life of Pi and, more recently, Hulu’s How I Met Your Father) is, on paper, everything a parent could want: devoted son, childhood spelling bee champ, attended MIT at 16, works for a vague startup. His profile has also been orchestrated by his parents (Manoj Sood and Sonia Dhillon Tully), owners of a struggling restaurant, but he’s interested in Asha (she’s gorgeous). She says it’s never going to happen, on principle of defying burdensome parental expectations (ie happiness requires a husband). But as in Netflix’s To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before or 10 Things I Hate About You or so many romcoms in between, there’s a fake dating plan – Asha and Ravi agree to pretend to date for 14 weddings to keep the gossipy aunties and their parents’ scheming temporarily at bay.</p> <p>There are various deceptions and reveals – Ravi’s on-paper resume doesn’t quite align with his IRL one, Asha has her own reasons but is not being emotionally honest – all headed in a clear happily ever after direction, all ultimately harmless. Still, it is fun to watch Ravi and Asha fall in love; Sharma can carry a whole scene with his eyes – deep pools of kindness – while Sharda thrums with the nervous energy of balancing too many competing interests. The two have a naturalistic chemistry that makes the various deceptions seem trivial and the chasteness of their romance (sex is barely implied) seem odd and anachronistic.</p> <p>True to Netflix romcoms, Wedding Season strikes a visual balance between serviceable and chintzy. Dey’s directing is basically anonymous within the Netflix house style (though there is a Bollywood dance credits sequence). Scenes at Asha’s placeless office, in which her debonair boss, James (Damian Thompson), and co-worker Tina (Ruth Goodwin) pitch investors for a London HQ, resemble Emily in Paris lite. The set-up of the 14 weddings offers the costume designer, Courtney Mitchell, plenty of space to deck out the cast in an array of beautiful outfits.</p> <p>The emphasis on the splendor of the weddings underscores that, beyond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/27/never-have-i-ever-netflix-mindy-kaling\">Never Have I Ever</a> or the second season of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/06/bridgerton-south-asian-representation-is-wonderfully-anachronistic\">Bridgerton</a>, there are still very few American productions with majority South Asian leads. I’m a white American; I can’t say what makes for an accurate depiction of a diasporic wedding, but I can say that Wedding Season is mostly pleasant to watch; it engages with the sharp elitism of the parents and the fraught compartmentalizations of their first-gen children without getting too bogged down in stereotypes or seriousness. Which is the mandate of the genre – there will always be room for a good, breezy romcom, and the set-up of an Indian wedding is ripe for one. As churn-able Netflix content goes, Wedding Season is on the better end of the spectrum.</p> <ul> <li><p>Wedding Season is available on Netflix on 4 August</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/03/eilish-mccolgans-epic-10000m-triumph-lights-up-commonwealth-games","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T21:30:49Z","webTitle":"Eilish McColgan’s epic 10,000m triumph lights up Commonwealth Games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/03/eilish-mccolgans-epic-10000m-triumph-lights-up-commonwealth-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/03/eilish-mccolgans-epic-10000m-triumph-lights-up-commonwealth-games","fields":{"headline":"Eilish McColgan’s epic 10,000m triumph lights up Commonwealth Games","trailText":"Eilish McColgan was inspired by surely the loudest roar heard since the London 2012 Olympics as she took a thrilling gold medal in the 10,000m","byline":"Sean Ingle at the Alexander Stadium","body":"<p>Not since Super Saturday has a British athletics stadium rocked and roared the way it did as Eilish McColgan rounded the final bend of the women’s 10,000m, ready to pounce for the first major title of her career.</p> <p>At that stage the 31-year-old was unsure whether she had the legs or the lungs to kick past the Kenyan Irene Cheptai.

And Johnson-Thompson’s winning score of 6,377 was also modest by her high standards. But after so much tears and turbulence this victory, her first in the heptathlon since October 2019, tasted particularly sweet.</p> <p>Most athletes struggle to come back from one career-threatening injury. Johnson has had two over the past two years. A three-inch scar on her left achilles tendon, and another on a torn right calf muscle she sustained at the Tokyo Olympics, have healed but they have also left their mark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a197d58e57067d15a069b6ec2c04e45035337d6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a197d58e57067d15a069b6ec2c04e45035337d6a/0_0_3275_2183/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katarina Johnson-Thompson finished with a comparatively low winning score.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson finished with a comparatively low winning score.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It feels incredibly especially this one, a home champs.

She then extended it with a long jump of a 6.33m best on her third and final attempt. However she was not out of the woods, with O’Connor having a far better javelin. But this was where Johnson-Thompson summoned up a champion’s heart, throwing 44.33m on a final attempt to surpass her personal best by 30cm.</p> <p>That left Johnson-Thompson with big enough lead to know gold was secure and she made it so by finishing the 800m in 2:13.93.

It was the start of a glorious career that has brought her five major titles, including a world championship gold medal in 2019, but also some recent setbacks.</p> <p>This performance answered some questions, but also raised others. Earlier this summer Johnson-Thompson had not completed a heptathlon for three years. Now she has finished three in nine weeks. That, undoubtedly, is a huge positive. But amid the celebrations the fact that her three scores – 6,174 points in Götzis, 6,222 in Eugene, and now 6,377 here – are among the lowest of her career should not be ignored, either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>To put it into context, Nafi Thiam won the world championships in Eugene a fortnight ago with a score of 6,974 points, while the bronze was secured with 6,755.

This game, for example, started a few minutes late because of the amount of coloured smoke generated by the pre-match fireworks, which briefly settled like a thick, pastel-coloured fog across the ground. When the players eventually came out it seemed the fog had not so much cleared as simply shifted from the field into the heads of the visiting side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/03/jake-lintott-hundred-southern-brave-england\">Late bloomer Jake Lintott starts Hundred with eye on England call-up | Simon Burnton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The innings started badly, with Joe Clarke out to the fourth ball without a run on the board, chipping meekly to Marcus Stoinis at cover, and never recovered. They eventually became so frantic that at one point Ben Duckett and Josh Cobb made such a hapless attempt to run a single that it ended with the bails off at both ends, both batters on the ground, Chris Jordan appealing to both umpires, a rare double video review and Cobb heading back to the bench. The fact that the first six of this year’s tournament, and by a margin the outstanding shot of Fire’s innings, was hit in the 19th of 20 five-ball overs by Noor Ahmed, their 17-year-old No 9, tells its own story, and Fire eventually limped to a total of 107 for seven.</p> <p>If the fourth ball of the first innings had set the tone for the remainder, a similarly telling moment came from the fifth ball of Brave’s reply. David Payne bowled it and Vince pulled straight to Ryan Higgins at deep square leg. Higgins took a few steps forward, crouched, got his hands in position, and let the ball fall through them, bounce through his legs, and roll away for four.

You learn from this and you go again next week. If you lose three wickets in the powerplay you don’t win too many games.

Scott, 25, is Scotland’s most decorated Commonwealth athlete of all time with 12 medals overall.</p> <p>Having trailed in third place after the opening butterfly lap, Scott tore through the field on the backstroke lap to establish a half-second lead after 100m. Despite Scott not letting up, Dean spent the final freestyle lap furiously chasing Scott down. He very nearly did but Scott held on to win with a Games record time of 1:56.88, just 0.13 ahead of Dean.</p> <p>“Rivalries or competition in general gets the best out of us. I say that for myself and I can say that for Deano, we love a race,” said Scott in a joint interview with Dean to the BBC. “Whether it’s with each other or anything from Olympic Games, World Champs or Commonwealth Games, we love the atmosphere, we love finals. We love getting in amongst it and we love racing each other as well because it gets the best out of each other.”</p> <p>This has been no deficient debut Commonwealth Games for Dean, whose second place finish yielded his sixth silver medal of the event.

He continued his sprinting dominance over all rivals by winning his third consecutive gold medal in the 50m freestyle. It is his second gold medal in Birmingham, having also won the 50m butterfly title.</p> <p>Now 27 years old, Proud is enjoying one of the best seasons of his career after also winning 50m freestyle gold at the World Championships in June.

But in a telling sign that the inquiry is close to wrapping up without an indictment, investigators recently returned the electronic devices to Mr. Giuliani, the people said. Mr. Giuliani <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/politics/rudy-giuliani-phone-unlock/index.html\">also met with prosecutors</a> and agents in February and answered their questions, a signal that his lawyers were confident he would not be charged.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is unlikely to be the last time Giuliani hears from prosecutors, both at the federal or state level.

Although the White House is limited in what it could do to improve access to abortion and reproductive rights without congressional action, advocates have urged federal agencies to make it easier to access abortion pills in states where they remain legal, and explicitly direct hospitals receiving federal funds for low-income healthcare programs to provide abortion drugs in life-threatening emergencies.</p> <p>In July, Biden signed an executive order directing HHS to “take action” to protect access to medication for abortion and update guidance to ensure that emergency care is not affected by abortion restrictions. It also directed the attorney general and the White House counsel to convene private lawyers and public interest organizations to encourage “robust legal representation of patients, providers and third parties lawfully seeking or offering reproductive healthcare services throughout the country”.

China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner.</p> <p>Taipei has remained defiant in its rhetoric. Tsai said on Wednesday that Taiwan “will not back down” in the face of heightened military threats, and would “do whatever it takes to maintain Taiwan’s peace and stability”. Beijing said its drills were “necessary and just”.</p> <p>Beijing’s latest drills are being closely followed by Taiwan, the US and other regional powers, said Nouwens.</p> <p>“The US will be looking for the PLA’s [People’s Liberation Army’s] use of conventional missiles in their inventory – eg, will China conduct anti-ship ballistic missile tests or use air-launched and ship-launched variants of ASBMs?</p> <p>“They will also be paying attention to the types of exercises – eg, whether, how often and how far the PLA cross over the median line, which they did today … crossing well over the median line.</p> <p>“Finally, they’ll also be seeking to get a better sense of the PLA’s coordination between air and maritime forces, particularly given the various scenarios that they’ve highlighted they will be exercising for.”</p> <p>Across the region, there is a growing sense of uncertainty, with the exercises having also upset regional neighbours. Japanese analysts said the northern drills were also a clear warning to their government about islands over which Tokyo and Beijing both claim ownership.</p> <p>“Those plans show that the Sakishima Islands, including Yonaguni, Ishigaki, and Miyako, could be affected by People’s Liberation Army operations as they assume the PLA is operating to the east of Taiwan,” Tetsuo Kotani, a professor of global studies at Meikai University, told the Japan Times.</p> <p>China’s ruling Communist party government, which regards Taiwan as its territory despite it having never ruled the island, has repeatedly warned of retaliation for the visit.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, China’s vice-foreign minister, Xie Feng, “urgently summoned” the US ambassador, Nicholas Burns, to lodge stern representations.

She is already the only British woman to win an Olympic weightlifting medal, snatching an unforgettable silver in Tokyo last year.</p> <p>Campbell is a world championships bronze medallist and two-time European champion.

In a show of spectacular dominance, she became the Commonwealth Games gold medallist for the first time in the women’s 87+kg division. Campbell produced a faultless performance under immense pressure, moving through her six lifts with skill and power, producing personal bests across the board.</p> <p>“Some would say it was a perfect Games,” she said. “To walk out the crowd in the opening ceremony was immense for a start. To lead out the home nation in a home Games is a very, very special privilege. The reason why we come here was to perform on the stage. To get that perfect performance on the stage? Yeah, you could call that a perfect Games.”</p> <p>As Campbell strode into the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham with her arms outstretched, her hair braided in red and white buns, the tightly packed crowd roared her name. Her biggest competition was the defending champion Feagaiga Stowers, who at 17 years old in 2018 had outperformed Campbell to win gold for Samoa in the previous Games on the Gold Coast of Australia.</p> <p>After the rest of the field competed for the minor positions in the snatch competition, the duel began. Campbell tore off her headphones, which had been blaring out bashment and soca, then she walked into the arena for her opening snatch lift.

At 121kg, Campbell punctuated her successful attempt by sticking her tongue out to the crowd with the weight above her head. Stowers, however, initially faltered at 121kg before lifting it in her final attempt. Campbell marched on, shattering her personal best with a lift of 124kg, pumping both of her fists and yelling.</p> <p>They returned later for the clean and jerk, with Stowers first labouring through a difficult opening lift of 147kg and then failing both of her subsequent attempts at 154kg. While Stowers struggled, Campbell soared. She cleared 152kg with ease, which was enough for her victory after Stowers’s failed lifts.</p> <p>But she kept on going. She easily completed 157kg. Then she signalled for 162kg, one kilo above her silver‑medal lift in Tokyo, her personal best. She began her routine: after pressing down her palms to calm herself and rolling her shoulders backwards, she gripped the bar, drove her legs and extended her arms, driving home a personal best for an overall Commonwealth Games record of 286kg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/03/mabia-aktar-raising-the-bar-for-female-empowerment-in-bangladesh\">Mabia Aktar raising the bar for female empowerment in Bangladesh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over these past few years, as her success has endured, life has changed immensely for Campbell.

The gains are plain to see and they have enabled her to envision even loftier successes.</p> <p>“It means that I can move closer to the gym now, I’ve got a real plan in place, a real team around me now,” she said. “Pushing forward towards Paris because we’ve got eyes on another medal in Paris. We want to do everything we can to make sure we’re there in the best shape possible. It’s not gonna be an easy ride.”</p> <p>Before the competition, Precious McKenzie, the legendary former weightlifter, was ushered on to the stage where he was saluted by the audience.

At noon on Thursday, the Bank of England will most likely increase interest rates for the sixth time in a row. Analysts are generally expecting a rise of a half of a percentage point– the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/Bank-Rate.asp\" title=\"\">biggest single hike</a> since before the Bank was made independent, when monetary policy was ultimately the responsibility of a chancellor called Ken Clarke.</p> <p>Yet this week’s rate rise is not intended to cool an overheating economy – far from it. Both the IMF and the OECD forecast that the UK will endure the weakest growth of any rich country next year, while the well-respected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/inflation-will-soar-to-astronomical-levels-over-next-year-thinktank-warns\" title=\"\">National Institute of Economic and Social Research</a> (Niesr) believes that the country will enter a recession this summer and stay there until well into next year. So why, then, is the Bank pushing up interest rates?</p> <p>To listen to its governor, Andrew Bailey, this is about signalling his commitment to keeping inflation at 2% – as he is mandated to do by the government. “Let me be quite clear: there are no ifs or buts in our commitment to the 2% inflation target,” he said at <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2022/july/andrew-bailey-speech-at-mansion-house-financial-and-professional-services-dinner\" title=\"\">the Mansion House dinner last month</a>. Yet pushing up interest rates in the UK will achieve precisely zero in bringing down the price of wheat or oil on global markets. It is the shortage of commodities around the world that is raising prices. That is why the Niesr expects inflation to soar to “astronomical” levels next year.</p> <p>If wages aren’t rising to keep pace, then what we currently label inflation is really a form of rationing – rationing by price, so that the wealthiest can afford to keep their houses warm this winter and their cars filled with petrol, while those with less money have to make some stark choices. Freezing or starving? New uniforms for the kids, or toys for Christmas? All higher rates do in this scenario is add to the economic pain by making mortgages and credit card bills another worry for families already stressed about paying for energy and food.</p> <p>This mess is not Mr Bailey’s creation. He might more fairly be viewed as the unluckiest Bank governor since it was cut loose in 1997. Mervyn King enjoyed what he dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/03/politics.money\" title=\"\">a “Nice” decade</a> (10 years of non-inflationary constant expansion); his successor, Mark Carney, was an astute politician basking in the support of George Osborne. Mr Bailey has faced a once-in-a-century pandemic, a global commodity shortage and constant sniping from senior Conservatives. Some think he should have raised rates far sooner and far higher – which would most likely have turned a recession into a depression. The frontrunner to be the next prime minister, Liz Truss, wants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jul/19/if-liz-truss-big-idea-remodel-monetary-policy-expect-markets-take-fright\" title=\"\">to rewrite the governor’s job description</a> so that he is even tougher on inflation.</p> <p>Where Ms Truss has a point is that, since 2010, the Tory government has relied on the Bank to keep interest rates as generously low as possible so that successive chancellors could be zealously tight on spending. The result of this regime has been to leave the Bank with precious little room for manoeuvre and to encourage a surge in the prices of houses, artwork and other assets. It was a dangerous economic policy that did nothing to channel money to where it is most needed (such as council housing, public services and the incomes of the lowest paid). It should be reversed – but not in this haphazard fashion, which will hurt businesses and harm households.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/03/antony-gormley-phallic-statue-imperial-college","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T18:00:50Z","webTitle":"Antony Gormley’s ‘phallic’ statue may damage our reputation, say students","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/03/antony-gormley-phallic-statue-imperial-college","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/03/antony-gormley-phallic-statue-imperial-college","fields":{"headline":"Antony Gormley’s ‘phallic’ statue may damage our reputation, say students","trailText":"Imperial College Union motion says students should have been consulted on work, due to ‘obvious’ erect penis interpretation","byline":"Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent","body":"<p>University students at Imperial College London are battling to prevent the installation of new sculpture by Antony Gormley over concerns that the work is “phallic”.</p> <p>Alert, a six-metre-high stack of cantilevered steel blocks meant to resemble a squatting human figure, is scheduled to be installed in the university’s newly built Dangoor Plaza in South Kensington this summer.</p> <p>According to Gormley, the sculpture represents a figure “balancing on the balls of the feet while squatting on its haunches”.</p> <p>But a motion released by the Imperial College Union says the sculpture may “hurt the image and reputation of the college” because of its “obvious” interpretation as a person baring their erect penis.</p> <p>Under this interpretation, the motion adds, the phallus extends “approximately three metres horizontally”, about half the total height of the artwork.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdc1c84123f5562a8c24c1ca957ec9c0c761d45f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdc1c84123f5562a8c24c1ca957ec9c0c761d45f/0_0_2030_1143/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram of sculpture showing two interpretations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diagram showing two interpretations of the Alert sculpture </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imperial College Union</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“While the artist’s intended form may ‘[evoke our] community of scientific research’ the phallic interpretation does not.

among the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. It took until 2017, and only at the second time of asking, for Muirfield to decide that admitting female members was appropriate. The R&amp;A had removed Muirfield from its pool of Open venues due to the male-only stance.</p> <p>The Open has not returned to East Lothian but the Women’s Open takes centre stage at Muirfield this week. The R&amp;A presides over this major, which has been elevated to the point where $7.3m (£6m) will be distributed on Sunday. The bigger picture relates to the landmark staging of such a significant women’s competition at a course once infamous for its gender policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/tiger-woods-liv-golf-offer-greg-norman\">Tiger Woods spurned offer in $800m range to join LIV Golf, Greg Norman says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Martin Slumbers, the R&amp;A’s chief executive, replied with “absolutely not” when asked whether this event had to be held at Muirfield before a men’s Open to make a broader point. “They are two very independent decisions,” Slumbers said. “The R&amp;A had no responsibility to this championship until 2016, and, in fact, we only got full control of it two years ago.</p> <p>“We thought: ‘How do we present it in a way that we think is world class and then move it in a way that the rest of the world thinks it’s world class, including the talent who are playing?’ Big-time sport needs big-time crowds. But big-time sport also needs big-time venues. We were absolutely focused on how do we get the best venues that we can get that mean the most to golf and stage the championship there.</p> <p>“When you look at the history of our game over here, there is no more important golf course other than perhaps the Old Course in St Andrews if you want to achieve that purpose. I think you only have to walk around and listen to some of the athletes playing; this is something special. So this was all about platform.

There are stories upon stories, many of which are presumably apocryphal but add to the legend of the club. There was, for example, the man who casually remarked on a particularly gusty day when ordering a drink in the clubhouse. “Bartender,” said a member sitting at the counter, “there is a gentleman here who wishes to discuss the weather.” In another oft-spoken-about instance, local constabulary pulled over a Muirfield member who had indulged in multiple gin and tonics over lunch. After said individual passed a breathalyser test, he came rampaging back into the clubhouse demanding to know who was watering down the club’s spirits.</p> <p>Tom Watson, in the company of Ben Crenshaw, was kicked off the course after attempting to play just two holes with hickory clubs. “What are you doing?” barked Paddy Hamner, the club secretary. “The course is closed. You’re not allowed here. Leave immediately.” Watson had won the 1980 Open there just hours earlier. And yet, for all the background nonsense, this is arguably the finest golf course in the world. It is certainly in the conversation. HCEG officials of old could also say with a degree of justification that they took the brunt of the criticism for a misogyny problem that reverberated across the sport.</p> <p>The Royal &amp; Ancient Club of St Andrews waited until 2014 to admit women. Even now, it is assumed there are just a handful of female members at Augusta National. The famed Pine Valley in New Jersey announced a first batch of women among its number in 2021. Only last May did Portmarnock end a 127-year male-only membership position.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/31/the-crowd-goes-wild-as-sports-clubs-bring-nature-off-the-bench-aoe\">UK sports clubs boost biodiversity by letting nature go wild on their grounds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s so important that the women are here this week,” said England’s Georgia Hall. “It makes such a mark on women’s golf. AIG [the tournament sponsors] and the R&amp;A have done a fantastic job working together to get the championship here.</p> <p>“It just keeps elevating this tournament to what is needed. Walton Heath next year and St Andrews coming up soon plus Pebble Beach for the US Open next year. I think the women’s game is definitely in the best position it ever has been and I’m very happy to be in the middle of my career.”</p> <p>Hall, 26 and a winner of this event four years ago, will have legitimate aspirations of a second Women’s Open title.

But in diplomacy the best option is often keeping things as they are, even if that means tolerating inconsistency and uncertainty. Such is the situation in the Taiwan strait, where artful imprecision prevents war.</p> <p>The visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi has upset the balance. The speaker of the House of Representatives is the most senior US politician to set foot on the island since 1997. As an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-speaker-pledges-us-solidarity-tsai-in-wen-china-military-drills\" title=\"\">assertion of solidarity</a> in the face of China’s territorial ambitions across the strait, Ms Pelosi’s trip looks like a breach of Washington’s “strategic ambiguity” on Taiwan’s status: it is not formally recognised as an independent state, but treated (and armed for self-defence) as a sovereign country.</p> <p>Some of President Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/23/biden-taiwan-china-strategic-ambiguity-us-foreign-policy\" title=\"\">past statements</a> have also strained ambiguity on the question of how far the US might go to defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion. But Ms Pelosi’s trip has triggered a full-blown crisis. Beijing has denounced what it sees as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/xi-jinping-tells-joe-biden-not-to-play-with-fire-over-taiwan-in-two-hour-call\" title=\"\">aggressive provocation</a> and is responding in kind with live-fire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-speaker-pledges-us-solidarity-tsai-in-wen-china-military-drills\" title=\"\">military exercises</a> in the waters surrounding Taiwan.</p> <p>That probably doesn’t presage an all-out assault, but Taiwan is justifiably anxious when the sabre rattles so close to its shores. It would not take much by way of misunderstanding and overzealous reaction for events to spiral out of control. The uncomfortable reality for outside observers is that China’s calculations around Taiwan are opaque. The country’s long economic expansion has abruptly slowed; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\" title=\"\">President Xi Jinping</a>’s authority is still vast, but not insuperable. It is unclear whether those conditions make it more or less likely he would gamble on a military adventure. Vladimir Putin’s wild land grab in Ukraine has shaken the confidence of western analysts in their own forecasts. Most thought Mr Putin would be restrained by a rational evaluation of national interests.</p> <p>The comparison is of limited use. Russia is a regional bully raging against decline. China is a global superpower. The stakes involved in a Pacific war of aggression against a US ally are incalculably high, even if western nations would balk at direct military engagement with the People’s Liberation Army.</p> <p>The White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/21/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-trip-not-good-idea-right-now-joe-biden\" title=\"\">would have preferred</a> Ms Pelosi not to cause a diplomatic disturbance but, once scheduled, the visit had to go ahead. Cancellation would have meant conceding that Beijing wields a global veto over who can visit Taiwan. The relationship has long been characterised by these calibrations. The cause of keeping the peace is served by the unglamorous business of diplomatic nuance and calculated uncertainty. (It is a lesson that the candidates in the Tory leadership should study instead of competing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/sunak-ruse-aims-to-outmanoeuvre-truss-over-china\" title=\"\">sound more hawkish</a> for the gratification of Conservative party members.)</p> <p>There are many stages of escalation between the present face-off and all-out war. Beijing can harry Taiwan with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/19/microsoft-exchange-hack-us-biden-administration-china\" title=\"\">cyber-sabotage</a>. Military exercises can be prolonged into something resembling an economic blockade. Where there is capacity for ratcheting up tension, there is also space for de-escalation. Previous crises in the Taiwan strait have been managed back into uneasy equilibrium. That is the best-case scenario now and one that is available if cool heads and an unfashionable taste for the status quo can prevail.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/03/marks-spencer-bans-sale-disposable-barbecues-uk-stores","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T17:58:56Z","webTitle":"M&S stops selling disposable barbecues in UK stores over fire risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/marks-spencer-bans-sale-disposable-barbecues-uk-stores","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/03/marks-spencer-bans-sale-disposable-barbecues-uk-stores","fields":{"headline":"M&S stops selling disposable barbecues in UK stores over fire risk","trailText":"Retailer removes items from its shops to ‘protect open spaces and reduce the risk of fires’","byline":"Joe Middleton","body":"<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has removed disposable barbecues from sale across all its UK stores to “protect open spaces and reduce the risk of fires”.</p> <p>Announcing the move on Wednesday, the retailer pointed out that it had already stopped selling the portable grills near national parks and in the capital but was now going a step further.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marksandspencer/status/1554873275469160451\">tweeted</a>: “Given the unusually hot and dry conditions, we’ve taken the precautionary step of removing them from sale across the UK.”</p> <p>It comes after Co-op decided to stop selling disposable barbecues in 130 shops situated in or within a one-mile radius of national parks, in June last year.

It has also created a major internal and international crisis for the group.</p> <p>Nearly a year after seizing control of Afghanistan they are still seeking diplomatic recognition for their government, which they hope will curb an economic crisis by allowing for the lifting of sanctions and the release of frozen funds. An aggressive response to Zawahiri’s death would not further that cause.</p> <p>But al-Qaida and its leadership are revered by many in the group’s ranks, who are also likely to see a drone strike in the heart of the capital as an assault on their sovereignty.</p> <p>A firefight in the heart of Kabul on Tuesday with Islamic State militants was a reminder that the group is under pressure inside Afghanistan from even more extremist groups, who are aiming to pick off disaffected Taliban fighters.</p> <p>“For Taliban who want to have a good relationship with the west I think this is a very tricky political situation,” said Bette Dam, analyst and author of a biography of the Taliban’s founding leader, Mullah Omar.</p> <p>“They need to comfort their fighters, by being harsh to the US … At the same time, they want to be political in order not to lose the US.”</p> <p>So after Zawahiri’s death the Taliban leadership has gathered to debate whether they should respond to the strike, and if so what approach to take, Reuters reported, citing senior figures in the movement.</p> <p>Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban’s designated delegate to the UN who is based in Doha, effectively acknowledged the group had not yet decided how to respond when he told journalists asking for comment on the strike: “I am awaiting details and reaction from Kabul. So far I have not received.”</p> <p>Kabul-based spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued only a short statement accusing America of violating the Doha agreement, which paved the way for its troop withdrawal. Some officials have said the house was empty but none have directly denied Zawahiri’s death.</p> <p>The Taliban had promised the US in Qatar that they would not offer haven to militant groups that may threaten America and its allies, and for nearly a year after seizing Afghanistan insisted they had stuck by that commitment.</p> <p>Just two days before the strike, the Taliban’s interior minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, told an <a href=\"https://www.news18.com/news/world/exclusive-afghanistan-needs-indias-help-desperately-to-secure-peaceful-environment-taliban-interior-minister-haqqani-5670295.html\">Indian news outlet</a> that al-Qaida was “already dead” and “has no presence in Afghanistan”.</p> <p>At the time, Zawahiri was still alive, in a house thought to be rented by one of Haqqani’s aides, in an enclave controlled by the minister’s own faction of the Taliban.</p> <p>It was an open secret among many circles in Kabul that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-kabul-neighbourhood-al-qaida-leader-dead-sherpur\">the area – a stone’s throw from the diplomatic enclave and ministry buildings</a> – was filled with “Arabs”, a barely veiled reference to foreign al-Qaida fighters, though the presence of their leader was likely a closely guarded secret.</p> <p>He may have been kept there under a form of house arrest. The Taliban previously summoned Osama bin Laden to their then-capital of Kandahar in the mid-1990s, in an attempt to curb his activities or improve oversight.</p> <p>It proved spectacularly unsuccessful and Zawahiri too seems to have operated effectively from his Kabul base, sending out messages and videos.</p> <p>Like his former guest, Haqqani has a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head for his role in terror attacks, and is reportedly still so concerned about his own security that he regularly switches homes even in Kabul. So it is unclear why he thought the al-Qaida leader was safer staying in one place.</p> <p>The US had long been clear that they would target Zawahiri, a key architect of the September 11 attacks on America, wherever they found him.</p> <p>But the Taliban, having defeated America on the battlefield, apparently thought they could also hide one of the most wanted men in the world from its spies.</p> <p>“The location of the strike is only about a five-minute walk from the German embassy, which itself is scarred from terrorism (a major Taliban attack in 2017), and the Taliban have been in talks with the Germans to try and bring back diplomats and German development aid,” said Graeme Smith, senior consultant with International Crisis Group, focused on Afghanistan.</p> <p>“So this highlights the really audacious hosting the Taliban were trying to do, trying to host representatives of the international system, while also hosting radicals bent on tearing down that system.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ten-million-people-have-left-ukraine-since-russian-invasion-un-says-as-first-grain-exports-arrive-in-turkey","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T17:57:20Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Scholz insists turbine at centre of Russian gas row works; 10m Ukraine border crossings since invasion – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ten-million-people-have-left-ukraine-since-russian-invasion-un-says-as-first-grain-exports-arrive-in-turkey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ten-million-people-have-left-ukraine-since-russian-invasion-un-says-as-first-grain-exports-arrive-in-turkey","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Scholz insists turbine at centre of Russian gas row works; 10m Ukraine border crossings since invasion – as it happened","trailText":"German chancellor says no reason to hold up return of turbine behind energy standoff; UN says number of border crossings from Ukraine passes 10m mark","byline":"Nicola Slawson (now); Martin Belam and Kate Lyons (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62eab5448f0892e28b4ab413\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T17:57:20.997Z\">6.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">End of day summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s a roundup of the key developments from today:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The first shipment of grain to leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. </strong>The Sierra Leone-registered ship, Razoni, set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the United Nations.

They suggested it was carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group, working closely with Vladimir Putin’s FSB spy agency.</p> <p>The dead Ukrainians were members of the Azov battalion, who defended the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol until their capture in May. They were being held at a prison in Olenivka, close to the frontline and about 10 miles south of occupied Donetsk.</p> <p>An adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said multiple clues pointed to Moscow’s guilt.

He was one of the driving forces behind the construction of two Baltic Sea pipelines to carry gas to Europe, one of which was mothballed following the invasion of Ukraine, the other, Nord Stream 1, is only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/19/germany-worries-about-gas-rationing-as-supply-from-russia-halted\">currently delivering 20%</a> of the level of gas expected.</p> <p>Schröder is facing an investigation by the Social Democrats of which he has been a member since 1963, over his Kremlin links and his refusal to distance himself from Putin, and could yet be ejected from the party.</p> <p>In a five-hour long interview with the magazine Stern and the broadcaster RTL he gave no direct insight into the mindset of the Russian leader, but said following his discussions with him he thought the conflict with Russia was “resolvable” but required more negotiations – which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> and France should lead – and a greater display of sensitivity by the west towards Russia’s “real fears of being hemmed in” by hostile countries, which “feed off historical events” and were “unfortunately also valid”.</p> <p>Looking to the future, Schröder recommended an Austria-style neutrality status for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, and a Swiss-style arrangement of cantons for what he referred to as the “more complicated” Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He said that both sides needed to show a willingness to compromise.</p> <p>But he would apparently not be drawn into talking about the atrocities which have been carried out by Russian troops since the start of the most recent stage in the conflict, including the massacre in Bucha, the deaths of thousands of civilians across the country, the occupation of eastern and southern regions, the forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainians and allegations the Kremlin is trying to eradicate the population.</p> <p>Regarding the row over why only a fifth – or 30m cubic metres a day – of the expected amount of gas is currently flowing through the Nord Stream pipeline, Schröder said the blame lay at the door of the German company Siemens, which he blamed for failing to deliver a recently serviced turbine to Russia.</p> <p>But according to the German government and to Siemens, it is Moscow that is to blame for its refusal to take delivery of the turbine, which was recently transported from Canada to Germany after a special dispensation was given allowing sanctions against Russia to be temporarily suspended.</p> <p>Read more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/ex-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroder-under-fire-for-meeting-putin\">Ex-German chancellor Gerhard Schröder under fire for meeting Putin </a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T05:11:55.743Z\">at 6.11am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62ea94ae8f0892e28b4ab221\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T15:31:18.210Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"888ff9efd8edf6cca775556635165eea27fbfae5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/888ff9efd8edf6cca775556635165eea27fbfae5/0_40_2300_1381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A couple reacts after the Russian shelling in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2022.

The ship has been inspected by members of the Joint Coordination Centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosporus Strait “shortly”</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its latest invasion of the country on 24 February. </strong>Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across Europe. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In its latest operation briefing, Russia’s ministry of defence has claimed that its strike on <strong>Radekhov</strong> in the Lviv region “destroyed a storage base with foreign-made weapons and ammunition delivered to the Kyiv regime from Poland”. Earlier today, Lviv’s governor acknowledged the strike, and said “one building was damaged. Fortunately, no one was hurt.”</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The UK’s ministry of defence says there is likely to be an increase in civilians attempting to flee Kherson and the surrounding area as hostilities continue and food shortages worsen, putting pressure on transport routes. </strong>They have also said that a Ukrainian strike against a Russian ammunition train in Kherson oblast, southern Ukraine, means it is “highly unlikely” the rail link between Kherson and Crimea is operational.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Mykola Tochytskyi</strong>, deputy minister of foreign affairs, has repeated Ukraine’s request for the skies over nuclear installations to be closed to prevent a potential accident and their misuse. He said “For the first time in history, civil nuclear facilities have been turned into military targets and springboards for the Russian army in breach of the non-proliferation provisions on peaceful use of nuclear energy. The world witnesses how nuclear terrorism, sponsored by the nuclear-weapon state, is arising in reality. The robust joint actions are needed to prevent nuclear disaster at global scale. We ask to close the sky over the nuclear power plants in Ukraine.”</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The US embassy in Kyiv has criticised what it says is a decision by <strong>Roskomnadzor</strong>, the Russian government’s media agency, to block a US government website – share.america.gov.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Russian foreign minister <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong> has said the US has not offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> to resume talks on the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The Ukrainian president, <strong>Volodymr Zelenskiy</strong>, has spoken to the Australian National University, thanking Australia for its support against the Russian invasion.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Gerhard Schroeder, a former German chancellor and friend of Vladimir Putin, said the Russian president wanted a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine and last month’s agreement on grain shipments might offer a way forward. </strong>“The good news is that the Kremlin wants a negotiated solution,” Schroeder told Stern weekly and broadcasters RTL/ntv, adding he had met Putin in Moscow last week. “A first success is the grain deal, perhaps that can be slowly expanded to a ceasefire.”</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland’s first minister, has been accused of glorifying war after she retweeted a Ukrainian tweet listing Russia’s war dead – described in an embedded graphic as “eliminated personnel”, before she quickly deleted it.

Her father, Frank, was a public high school principal engaged in school and community life, calling bingo to raise funds for the school bus and annual play. Her mother, Pamela, left school at 15 but ended up becoming a teacher, too: “That was the Whitlam years – they paid for her to go back to school.”</p> <p>McClements and her partner, the actor Jacek Koman, sent their two children – Clementine, now 21 and travelling overseas, and Quincy, 15 – to an inner-Melbourne public school. “I have been so happy with the people that have taught my kids in the public system,” she says. “They are really dedicated.” </p> <p>Betzien was almost entirely educated in Queensland public schools, apart from part of one year in a private school in Rockhampton. Her father, Paul, worked his way up to becoming a public high school principal, completing his teaching degree “under the whole <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/07/when-gough-whitlam-moved-into-my-cabramatta-street-my-life-was-transformed\">Whitlam initiative</a> of getting teachers scholarships and being sent to remote places to pay back that scholarship”. Her mother, Helen, put herself through university as a mature-age student and became a high school drama teacher.</p> <p>The playwright says she values her son’s teachers so much, “especially after the pandemic and homeschooling, we realised how incredible they are. It’s a small miracle they manage to teach little people how to read in a year.” The school is “brilliant”, she says, but she agrees with what one teacher in another school told her, about the Australian system’s “obsession” with testing: “You don’t fatten the pig by measuring it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31bedfbf28480586a4de5b8e22b835b39ccd2524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31bedfbf28480586a4de5b8e22b835b39ccd2524/0_101_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teachers and supporters rally in Sydney \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teachers and supporters rally in Sydney after the state government’s offer of a 3% pay rise in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“My six-year-old got his report card back yesterday and I was really surprised to see that there was grading of different areas, from A to D,” Betzien says. “Obviously, I want to know areas where he should improve and areas that he’s doing well at, but I think that grading builds up a narrative in a little person’s mind about whether or not they’re good at school, and it’s really hard to shift those narratives once they’re set. I think it’s absurd. The Scandinavian countries don’t even start to assess until much, much later in schooling. Why are we doing this?”</p> <p>Australia has blindly followed the UK and US models of educational inequality, she believes; she cites the education expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/07/pasi-sahlberg-finland-teach-australian-schools-education\">Pasi Sahlberg</a> from Finland, where there are no private schools. In Australia today, such a system feels impossible: “The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/18/independent-private-schools-hire-labor-aligned-lobbyists-to-fight-for-school-funding\">lobbyist groups</a> have such influence on politicians that they’re afraid to actually revolutionise our system.”</p> <p>In her research, Betzien found that inequality had caused some schools to become “toxic”, a legacy of the “commodification” of education she says began in the 1980s. She mentions the New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet’s suggestion of introducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/jun/27/performance-pay-for-nsw-teachers-will-make-the-crisis-worse\">performance pay</a> for teachers. “That’s proven globally not to work,” she says. “It’s pitting teachers against teachers, and you can’t measure good teaching, you can’t quantify it.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/11/we-cant-lose-any-more-how-the-teacher-shortage-grew-into-a-national-crisis\">‘We can’t lose any more’: how the teacher shortage grew into a national crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NSW and Victorian governments have announced that both states will add a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/16/victoria-and-nsw-to-announce-overhaul-of-preschool-education\">pre-prep year</a> into schooling, but Betzien questions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/11/we-cant-lose-any-more-how-the-teacher-shortage-grew-into-a-national-crisis\">where the extra teachers will come from</a>. As the mother of a two-year-old as well, she says, “that was quite funny to me, as a parent paying crippling daycare fees – I think, ‘Oh, great, a free year of play-based learning.’ I worry that that’s a smokescreen. If it’s genuine play-based learning, that’s fine. But if it’s about just getting kids prepped for school even earlier, at the age of four, then I worry enormously about that. I don’t want my child sitting down at a desk and learning formally at four.”</p> <p>But with the change in federal government, Betzien sees some “refreshing” hope on the horizon, particularly in the form of Jason Clare, the new education minister, who attended a public school in Cabramatta in Sydney’s south-west.</p> <p>“He’s the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonClareMP/status/1531923610818203649?s=20&amp;t=cbc_p_tw7oY68ANOmsFp_g\">first of his family</a> to finish high school, let alone go to university, and when he recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonclaremp/status/1532837051305181184?lang=en\">returned to his old school</a>, he greeted his old teacher and there were tears,” Betzien says. “I really hope that that lived experience is going to translate into empathy for what teachers are enduring and the state of our system. Hopefully he’ll push to revolutionise our system – because that’s what it needs.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Chalkface plays <a href=\"https://statetheatrecompany.com.au/shows/chalkface/\">State Theatre Company of South Australia</a> 5-20 August; <a href=\"https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/whats-on/productions/2022/chalkface\">Sydney Theatre Company</a> 15 September to 29 October; <a href=\"https://riversideparramatta.com.au/show/chalkface/\">Riverside Parramatta</a> 3-5 November; and <a href=\"https://canberratheatrecentre.com.au/show/chalkface/\">Canberra Theatre Centre</a> 9-12 November</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/04/in-archie-roach-we-have-a-quintessential-example-of-how-powerful-a-voice-can-be","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T17:30:35Z","webTitle":"In Archie Roach we have a quintessential example of how powerful a voice can be | Larissa Behrendt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/in-archie-roach-we-have-a-quintessential-example-of-how-powerful-a-voice-can-be","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/in-archie-roach-we-have-a-quintessential-example-of-how-powerful-a-voice-can-be","fields":{"headline":"In Archie Roach we have a quintessential example of how powerful a voice can be","trailText":"As we make progress on an Indigenous voice to parliament, the modern-day storyteller is a bold reminder of what speaking our stories could achieve","byline":"Larissa Behrendt","body":"<p>When Archie Roach released Charcoal Lane, the broader Australian community carried a large secret.</p> \n<p>Archie’s first single, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/13/archie-roachs-took-the-children-away-how-one-heartbreaking-song-galvanised-a-nation\">Took the Children Away</a>, released in September 1990 off the now iconic album Charcoal Lane, came at a time when too many Australians still claimed to know nothing of the stolen generations.

It was also a call to the broader Australian community to finally acknowledge what had happened.</p> \n<p>The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s Bringing them Home report was tabled in parliament in 1997. Its strength lay in the extensive first-hand accounts contained throughout the report, including from the families of those who were taken away. These haunting, powerful testimonies assisted in showing the depth of devastation caused by the policy and the systemic abuse in all its forms of the children who were taken.</p> \n<p>Commissioned by the Keating government’s attorney general Michael Lavarch after extensive lobbying by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island advocates, most of them survivors of the policy, the Bringing them Home report was received by the Howard government who, in keeping with its broader agenda of rolling back Aboriginal rights (“the pendulum had swung too far,” John Howard had <a href=\"https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-10469\">said on native title</a>), sought to undermine the importance of the report.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff5ae80a-c0c7-4298-9f95-5176e62af6df\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1bdsM-mh40?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This was done through a formal response that sought to once again remove the voices of the stolen generations’ survivors and their families by saying it was only one in 10 children who were taken away (a contested figure given the poor record-keeping) – an attempt to shift attention away from the stories back to the cold statistics. Other criticisms from the official government report included that the policy was done with the best of intentions, that it was incorrect to use the term “cultural genocide” and that child removal was a thing of the past.</p> \n<p>All of these propositions have strong, evidence-based counter-arguments.

point about the state of political discourse saying there was “too much of an obsession with identity politics and single issues like climate change”.</p> \n<p>Expressing scepticism about the causes of climate change, its impacts or the motives behind calls for action, has become a part of the political identity of many conservatives, particularly in the US and Australia.</p> \n<p>Howard was trying to pin the “identity politics” label on progressives.</p> \n<p>But by continuing to express scepticism on climate change only seconds later shows how critics of “identity politics” like Howard can still engage in it.</p> \n<h2>The IPCC’s hidden agenda?</h2> \n<p>Howard’s public stance on climate change has flip-flopped over the years.</p> \n<p>In <a

the issue which, given the overwhelming evidence gathered over many decades, is a bit like saying you’re agnostic about gravity.</p> \n<p>During that 2013 speech, Howard quoted Prof Ottmar Edenhofer, a lead author of a UN climate assessment at the time.</p> \n<p>“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy,” Howard quoted Edenhofer as saying. “This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy any more.”</p> \n<p>Revealing his “real agenda”, Howard said Edenhofer had gone on to say: “One must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy.”</p> \n<p>This quote has been used over and over by climate science contrarians for years as evidence that the UN’s climate convention represents a hidden socialist agenda to redistribute wealth.</p> \n<p>Just last week, Maurice Newman – a business adviser to another former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott – used the exact same quotes to make the exact same point in an <a href=\"https://www.spectator.com.au/2022/06/perhaps-in-the-next-life/\">article in the Spectator</a>.</p> \n<p>“At least the leftist Potsdam Institute’s Prof Ottmar Edenhofer has the courage to say out loud what is becoming more obvious by the day,” wrote Newman, not mentioning that the quotes are 12 years old.</p> \n<p>The source is an English translation of an interview Edenhofer gave to Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung in 2010.</p> \n<p>Edenhofer told Temperature Check the quotes were taken “completely out of context” and had been spread by opponents of climate action “again and again”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\"

It’s definitely not the climate.”</p> \n<p>He said three-quarters of Dutch nature reserves were affected by nitrogen pollution and the country’s intensive agriculture industry – one that keeps 115 million pigs, cows, chickens and goats in a country with only 17 million people.</p> \n<p>The nitrogen standards applied to all countries in Europe, but the country’s highest court had declared three years ago the government’s policies were invalid.</p> \n<p>Van Tilburg said: “As a result of this, it’s not allowed any more to issue permits for activities and projects that cause nitrogen emissions.

Only 2.6GL has been delivered so far, eight years into the 10-year plan.</p> <p>“It seems to be pretty rotten way to operate,” said Richard Beasley, senior counsel to the Murray-Darling Basin royal commission and author of Dead in the Water.</p> <p>“It’s an unfair way for cooperative federalism to work – that somewhere along the way the other states said ‘fuck South Australia’ and ‘fuck the 450’.”</p> <p>The 450GL is embedded in the Water Act, and from there it is included in the basin plan, Beasley said. It was the critical factor in convincing SA to sign up to the plan.</p> <p>“So it’s all enshrined in the law,” he said. “It’s for the Coorong, the Lower Lakes and the mouth of the Murray. And rivers die from the mouth.</p> <p>“The Coorong may be in SA, which is not SA’s fault, but it’s the most important wetland in Australia. We will go into drought again and the Coorong is the last refuge for a lot of wildlife.”</p> <p>Not only is it the nation’s most vital wetland, Beasley says, it’s listed under the Ramsar convention (also known as the convention on wetlands), meaning Australia has international obligations to protect it.</p> <p>Plibersek, who will meet with state and territory water ministers in the coming weeks, said she was already working towards meeting the target. Asked if water buybacks were the only way to get there, she said “nothing’s off the table at this stage”.</p> <p>“We are very clear about what our objectives are, but we are open-minded.”</p> <p>This week’s Water for the Special Environment Account (WESA) report said the water would not be delivered “under the current settings”. Plibersek said projects already underway would continue, but that the Liberal and National parties had stymied the process with “brown tape” that limited the projects that would be approved.</p> <p>“They tied up the water for the environment special account … with irrational rules [in a] deliberate effort to sabotage the plan,” she said.</p> <p>While the 450GL is enshrined in law, a separate deal struck later between state and federal water ministers added the proviso that it would only be delivered if there were no adverse socioeconomic consequences. That is often interpreted to mean a project to save water can’t go ahead if it means a single job will be lost.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Buybacks were capped and effectively stopped under the Coalition government, which argued that they damaged communities.</p> <p>Perin Davey, a Nationals senator and the opposition water spokesperson, said her position reflected the feelings of communities throughout the Basin.</p> <p>“Voluntary buybacks reward an individual for their water, but the water is taken out of consumptive use,” she said.</p> <p>“It impacts the communities, it squeezes the water networks.”</p> <p>The opposition might be open to “strategic buybacks”, she said, if someone who wanted to sell water was assessed and it was determined there would be no wider effects, but any decision would depend on the details of specific legislation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/labor-says-it-wont-put-head-in-the-sand-as-it-releases-shocking-environment-report\">State of the environment: shocking report shows how Australia’s land and wildlife are being destroyed </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prof Quentin Grafton from the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy said the deal that no projects would go ahead if there were any unintended consequences was “just an agreement”.</p> <p>“Think about all the jobs that were lost because we didn’t have sufficient flows,” he said. “There have been thousands of jobs already lost.”</p> <p>Buybacks were the answer, Grafton said.</p> <p>Grafton said “literally hundreds” of academic papers had documented the decline and degradation of the basin – from blue-green algae outbreaks, to mass fish kills, to towns running out of water – and that extraction had to be sustainable not just in times of floods, but in dry periods.</p> <p>“The key object of the Water Act was to ensure environmentally sustainable levels of extraction.

The mythologies that we passed down from generation to generation weren’t just about positive events, great triumphs and heroes … there was an entire genre of tragedy.”</p> \n<p>However, fictionalising and rehashing crimes will always be a traumatic experience for some, especially the loved ones of victims or survivors.</p> \n<p>“We have a need to understand and confront the full gamut of human emotion and human behaviours. So I do think that there is a legitimate argument that art should be able to explore this,” Dean says. “But it has to be done sensitively and needs to be done in good faith.

If that happens, Keir Starmer’s government will have silenced warning voices in the membership and imported the seeds of its own destruction. <br><strong>Dr Peter Mangan</strong><br><em>Beckenham, London</em></p> <p>• Back in the day (the late 1960s), I had to wait until I was 21 to cast my first vote, and it was for Labour. Since then I have been a Labour member and local activist, and have worked for an old-school Labour MP. He had started his working life in the north-west as a teenager sweeping industrial waste in a chemical factory. All his working life he fought for the rights of the poor and vulnerable in society, and eventually carried his life’s work and vision for Labour to the House of Lords.</p> <p>For nearly 50 years, I’ve lived in a solid Tory constituency in Surrey. I’ve mainly voted Labour, but, with Tony Blair’s failure to bring in proportional representation, I’ve often cast a tactical vote for the Liberal Democrats. I became so disappointed with Keir Starmer’s muddled and fence-sitting policies, together with his lacklustre opposition to Boris Johnson, that once again I’m no longer a Labour party member and I find myself politically homeless. There are many of us across society who are disillusioned members of what was once the great Labour family. <br><strong>Jacqueline Mackenzie </strong><br><em>Epsom, Surrey</em></p> <p>• Neal Lawson (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/post-corbyn-vision-labour-keir-starmer-leadership?amp;amp;fs=e&amp;amp;amp;s=cl\" title=\"\">What happened to the post-Corbyn vision for Labour? Keir Starmer offers nothing, 28 July</a>) suggests that the party is trying to follow the New Labour playbook. If so, it is not doing it very well. By this point, two years before the 1997 election, New Labour already had some eye-catching policies – the minimum wage, signing the EU social chapter, the windfall tax on privatised utilities, and devolution.</p> <p>Tony Blair understood the importance of Labour having clear, distinctive policies. The problem with Labour under Keir Starmer is that it is even less radical than Blair’s party, and certainly a long way from amassing a 179-seat majority. <br><strong>John Bourn</strong><br><em>Gateshead, Tyne and Wear</em></p> <p>• Polly Toynbee may well be correct in arguing that Keir Starmer’s caution will carry Labour to victory.

The Young Vic was originally an offshoot of Laurence Olivier’s National Theatre company based at the Old Vic.</p> <p>Donald was born in Birmingham, one of three children of Nita (nee Abbot) and Thomas Sartain. He went to King Edward’s school in Edgbaston, then Birmingham University, followed by national service in the RAF. Excited by the exceptional work he saw at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/05/barry-jackson\">Barry Jackson</a>’s Birmingham repertory theatre, he answered an ad in the Stage newspaper for an assistant stage manager with Tonbridge weekly repertory company in 1955.</p> <p>He then joined another pioneer of community theatre, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/23/guardianobituaries.arts\">Joan Littlewood</a>, at Theatre Workshop, which he found quite difficult. It was not a happy time for him, but he later realised what a valuable training it had been.</p> <p>In 1956, with the actor Bernard Gallagher and director Austin Rosser, he formed the Renaissance theatre company at the Lyme Regis Marine theatre. Two years later, he reopened the crumbling Her Majesty’s in Barrow, Cumbria, where he declared what would be his career-long credo: of offering “good plays of every kind, early presentation of new controversial plays, first productions, good comedy and the best of the English dramatic heritage”. </p> <p>He was headhunted by the Dundee Rep in 1964. Dundee was already becoming well known, with such actors as Michael York and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/29/jill-gascoine-obituary\">Jill Gascoine</a> in the company and many actors, directors and designers eager to see what was going on. One was Dunlop – and he invited Donald to join him at the Young Vic. </p> <p>The Young Vic opened with Scapino<em>,</em> an adaptation of Molière designed by Carl Toms. Initially it employed young actors from the National, such as Jeremy Irons, as well as sharing a box office, but gradually success enabled the theatre to be independent.

Despite coming up through the play-offs in May, they currently look the best equipped to stay up of the three promoted sides but their fans are almost certainly under no illusions that anything better than a 17<sup>th</sup> place finish come season’s end would be an absolute triumph upon their long-awaited and welcome return to the top flight.</p> <p>Forest are due to face Newcastle on Saturday at St James’ Park, a simmering cauldron full of raucous natives who are genuinely enthused by the prospect of a new campaign for the first time in 15 years. For the majority of Forest’s players and their manager, Steve Cooper, it is likely to be a top-flight baptism of fire but in loanee Dean Henderson they have a player who is, by his own account, one of the best goalkeepers in the world, even if assorted figures at his parent club are too blind to see it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-16-nottingham-forest\">Premier League 2022-23 preview No 16: Nottingham Forest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an airing of grievances with Talksport reminiscent of Father Ted Crilly’s embittered acceptance speech at the Golden Cleric Awards, the 25-year-old described the manner in which he was treated by Manchester United last season as “criminal”. Speaking to Faye Carruthers, he explained how he had been promised the position of first-choice keeper by Ole Gunnar Solskjær, only for the Norwegian to change his mind and plump for David de Gea when Henderson … er, got knacked before the Euros and then fell ill with Covid.</p> <p>“The conversation I had coming out of the Euros squad was: ‘You’re coming back here to be the No 1’,” he said. “I got Covid-19, came back, so I should have still been the No 1 but then nobody followed through with what they had told me. To sit there for 12 months, it is criminal really, at my age. I was fuming. I told the hierarchy that I need to be playing football and to let me go, and I was almost gone before the manager [Erik ten Hag] came through the door. I have not spoken to him since.”</p> <p>While Henderson may well have been promised the No 1 spot at Manchester United, the sensational form of De Gea, one of very few United players not to thoroughly disgrace themselves last season and the man voted the club’s Best of a Bad Bunch in the end of season awards, render his comments a tad moot. On his non-relationship with Ten Hag, Henderson said – without batting an eyelid – that “I didn’t really want the manager to come in and be able to see me in training because I knew that he’d probably want to keep me”.</p> <p>With that kind of bulletproof self-confidence, Ten Hag’s loss is likely to be Cooper and Forest’s gain, even if Henderson turns out to be only half the signing he thinks he is. With war historian and his fellow new Forest recruit Wayne Hennessey waiting – or possibly waving – in the wings, he can’t afford to mess up.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“Dear Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss, we have made incredible strides in the women’s game, but this generation of school girls deserve more.

schools after the Department for Education (DfE) refused to say it would change the guidance.</p> <p>The open letter to the two Tory leadership candidates has been signed by the squad who won the historic victory in the Women’s Euro 2022 on Sunday.</p> <p>In the letter, the players say many of them had experienced being stopped from playing football in their teenage years.</p> <p>“Throughout the Euros, we as a team spoke about our legacy and goal to inspire a nation. Many will think this has already been achieved but we see this as only the beginning,” they wrote.</p> <p>“We are looking to the future. We want to create real change in this country and we are asking you, if you were to become prime minister on 5 September, to help us achieve that change.”</p> <p>A report by England Football, part of the Football Association (FA), showed that just 44% of secondary schools provide equal football lessons in PE for both boys and girls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/08/how-to-get-your-kids-into-sport-for-life\">How to get your kids into sport for life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The reality is we are inspiring young girls to play football only for many to end up going to school and not being able to play,” the letter signed by the 23 players said.</p> <p>“This is something we all experienced growing up. We were often stopped from playing. So we made our own teams, we travelled across the country and, despite the odds, we just kept playing football.”</p> <p>The letter asks Sunak and Truss to commit to ensuring all girls have two hours a week of PE lessons and invest in and support female PE teachers as well as resources for girls’ football sessions.</p> <p>“This generation of school girls deserves more. They deserve to play football at lunchtime, they deserve to play football in PE lessons and they deserve to believe they can one day play for England.”</p> <p>Labour MP Bridget Phillipson has written to the education secretary demanding an “equal access guarantee” in school PE lessons. The current DfE guidance is that schools should provide “comparable sporting activities”, which she said is outdated and limits girls’ access to sport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"&lt;iframe id=&quot;morning-briefing&quot; name=&quot;morning-briefing&quot; src=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; seamless=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe&quot; height=&quot;52px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; data-component=&quot;email-embed--morning-briefing&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The DfE has refused to commit to ensuring that girls have access to football in schools.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sunak said: “Rishi passionately believes in the importance of sport for children’s development and would love to see all schools provide two hours of PE a week … he has committed to launch a review of women’s football immediately if he is made prime minister to make sure that all women and girls have the opportunity to take part in the beautiful game.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Truss said: “Liz wants equal access to all sports for boys and girls, and supports campaigns such as the <a href=\"https://www.thefa.com/news/2021/oct/11/letgirlsplay-20211011\">FA’s Let Girls Play campaign</a>.

They suggested it was carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group, working closely with Vladimir Putin’s FSB spy agency.</p> <p>The dead Ukrainians were members of the Azov battalion, who defended the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol until their capture in May. They were being held at a prison in Olenivka, close to the frontline and about 10 miles south of occupied Donetsk.</p> <p>An adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said multiple clues pointed to Moscow’s guilt. They said graves were dug next to the barracks shortly before the attack, and a Russian information campaign was launched describing the fighters as terrorists.</p> <p>The prisoners were moved to the building the day before Friday’s explosion. The Russians rebased their artillery near the prison complex in an unsuccessful attempt to draw return Ukrainian fire. “This was a provocation and mass killing by the Russian side. It was organised by Putin’s regime,” claimed the official, who declined to be named.</p> <p>Putin may have personally authorised the attack, they speculated, adding: “Russia is not a democratic state. The dictator is personally responsible for everything, whether it’s the shooting down of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\">MH17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/eu-leaders-condemn-killing-of-unarmed-civilians-in-bucha-and-kyiv\">Bucha</a> or Olenivka. For some time we have not seen Mr Putin. When is he going to recognise the atrocities he has committed?”</p> <p>Russia’s defence ministry says Ukrainians destroyed the building using a Himars long-range missile made and supplied by the US. Footage broadcast on Russian television on Friday showed charred bodies, dismembered limbs and tangled metal from bunkbeds, as well as a hole in the prison’s roof.</p> <p>The Biden administration says there are no indications that Ukraine attacked the site. Satellite photos released by Maxar Technologies reveal that surrounding buildings were wholly undamaged. Russian guards escaped without injury.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6d9e5fbde460d1611c9fe6c6e9a11c1b7abfd2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6d9e5fbde460d1611c9fe6c6e9a11c1b7abfd2e/0_258_6405_3843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A satellite image from Maxar Technologies of the Olenivka prison complex after the blast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satellite image from Maxar Technologies of the Olenivka prison complex after the blast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based thinktank, said the evidence strongly suggested Russia caused the blast, using either a “precision strike or an internally planted incendiary or explosive”. It said there were no shell craters in the vicinity.</p> <p>The Kyiv official said the Russian Himars claim was “stupid” and made no sense, pointing out that the Azov fighters were regarded by Ukrainians as national heroes. “This was a terrorist act approved at the highest level. It wasn’t a tactical decision,” they said.</p> <p>Zelenskiy has called for an independent investigation into what happened. So far the Kremlin has refused to give access to the site to the Red Cross and UN, which helped negotiate the surrender of the Azovstal defenders and secured guarantees from Moscow that they would be properly treated.</p> <p>Ukraine has not been able to confirm the number of casualties, put by the Russian defence ministry at 53 dead and 75 injured. Names remain confidential.

The other, Nord Stream 1, is only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/19/germany-worries-about-gas-rationing-as-supply-from-russia-halted\">delivering 20%</a> of the level of gas expected.</p> <p>Schröder is facing an investigation by the Social Democrats, of which he has been a member since 1963, over his Kremlin links and his refusal to distance himself from Putin, and could yet be ejected from the party.</p> <p>In a five-hour long interview with the magazine Stern and the broadcaster RTL he gave no direct insight into the mindset of the Russian leader. However, he said after his discussions with Putin he thought the conflict with Russia was “resolvable” but required more negotiations – which Germany and France should lead – and a greater display of sensitivity by the west towards Russia’s “real fears of being hemmed in” by hostile countries, which “feed off historical events” and were “unfortunately also valid”.</p> <p>Looking to the future, Schröder recommended an Austria-style neutrality status for Ukraine, and a Swiss-style arrangement of cantons for what he referred to as the “more complicated” Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He said that both sides needed to show a willingness to compromise.</p> <p>But he would apparently not be drawn into talking about the atrocities which have been carried out by Russian troops since the start of the most recent stage in the conflict, including the massacre in Bucha, the deaths of thousands of civilians across the country, the occupation of eastern and southern regions, the forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainians and allegations the Kremlin is trying to eradicate the population.</p> <p>Regarding the row over why only a fifth – or 30m cubic metres a day – of the expected amount of gas is currently flowing through the Nord Stream pipeline, Schröder said the blame lay at the door of the German company Siemens, which he blamed for failing to deliver a recently serviced turbine to Russia.</p> <p>But according to the German government and to Siemens, it is Moscow that is to blame for its refusal to take delivery of the turbine, which was recently transported from Canada to Germany after a special dispensation was given allowing sanctions against Russia to be temporarily suspended.</p> <p>“We would be seeing 60m cubic metres, so double the amount that is currently flowing, were the turbine (Nr 2) available. That is down to Siemens as far as I understand it,” he said. The same explanation as to why the turbine remains stuck in Siemens Energy’s Mühlheim an der Ruhr factory has been given by Putin himself.</p> <p>On Wednesday the site was visited by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who hoped to use the occasion to, as he put it, “call Russia’s bluff”, emphasising that the turbine’s stasis was down to Moscow.</p> <p>Schröder earned scorn on social media and in government circles for his insistence in the interview that the simple solution to Germany’s energy needs – as it faces a winter of inadequate gas supplies – would be to activate Nord Stream 2, the construction of which was completed before it was scrapped by the German government in protest at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The simplest solution would be to start up the operation of Nord Stream 2,” Schröder said. “It is completed. If it really gets tight regarding gas, we have this pipeline, and with both pipelines together there would be no supply problem for German industry or for German households.”</p> <p>The German government has no plans to activate the pipeline.</p> <p>Asked why he had refused to distance himself from Putin, Schröder responded: “I would ask how would it help anyone if I were to personally distance myself from Vladimir Putin? … Maybe I can even be of some use. So why should I apologise?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/03/democrats-abortion-rights-victory-kansas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T15:35:56Z","webTitle":"‘This is huge’: Democrats hail abortion rights victory in Kansas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/democrats-abortion-rights-victory-kansas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/democrats-abortion-rights-victory-kansas","fields":{"headline":"‘This is huge’: Democrats hail abortion rights victory in Kansas","trailText":"Democrats celebrated the Kansas vote as a testament to the desire for abortion rights nationwide, even in Republican-held states","byline":"Gloria Oladipo","body":"<p>Democrats including Joe Biden hailed the outcome of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/kansas-abortion-vote-state-constitution\">abortion rights ballot question in Kansas</a>, after a majority voted to protect the right in the state constitution.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/kansas-abortion-rights-referendum-reaction\">‘We could feel it’: Kansans celebrate upset abortion rights victory</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a statement, the president <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/02/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-defeat-of-kansas-ballot-measure-threatening-womens-right-to-abortion/\">said</a>: “Voters in Kansas turned out in record numbers to reject extreme efforts to amend the state constitution to take away a woman’s right to choose and open the door for a statewide ban.</p> \n<p>“This vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own healthcare decisions.”</p> \n<p>The Kansas vote was the first time abortion rights had been on the ballot since the conservative-dominated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court\">supreme court overturned Roe v Wade</a>, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed the right, in June.</p> \n<p>A yes vote would have allowed the conservative Kansas legislature to restrict abortion or ban it completely.</p> \n<p>Other senior Democrats celebrated the Kansas vote as a testament to the desire for abortion rights nationwide, even in Republican-held states.</p> \n<p>The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1554661481769205760\">tweeted</a>: “This is huge: abortion rights were on the ballot for the first time since Roe, and the people of Kansas voted to preserve access.

No one has been convicted of his murder.</p> <p>The Morgan family reacted with anger and disappointment at the announcement by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), having spent 35 years fighting what they see as a cover-up and failure to confront corruption.</p> <p>Last year an independent review ordered by the government <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20220331104035/https://www.danielmorganpanel.independent.gov.uk/the-report/\">personally censured Dick for obstructing its work.</a></p> <p>On Wednesday, the IOPC announced that after 14 months it believed no new criminal or disciplinary charges could be bought over the case, which is one of the biggest scandals to blight British policing.</p> <p>On Dick, the commissioner of the Met until February this year, the IOPC accepted she may have broken the rules, but the watchdog said it still could not take any action because the alleged breaches were not serious enough, and would have to amount to gross misconduct.</p> <p>The IOPC said: “We assessed that she may have breached police standards of professional behaviour by not providing full and exceptional disclosure to the [panel] sooner, although not to the extent that would justify disciplinary proceedings. On this basis we have no grounds to exercise our power of initiative.</p> <p>“We found that she acted with a genuine belief to protect the information but may have got the balance wrong and should have given greater priority to her duty to provide full and exceptional disclosure to the panel.”</p> <p>Dick maintained her defiance, and said: “I disagree with their analysis that my actions ‘may give an indication of a breach of standards of professional behaviour’ and that ‘I may have got the balance wrong’.”</p> <p>The Morgan family accused the police watchdog of sharing the same “sickness” as the Met, adding: “What we find here is a rather shabby exercise by the IOPC to avoid the implications of the police corruption and criminality which the panel’s report compelled them to acknowledge.</p> <p>“In the same vein, we see the IOPC forced to find that ex-commissioner Cressida Dick ‘may have breached police standards of professional behaviour’ in the obstructive stance she chose to adopt towards the work of the panel, but they then go to look for reasons not to use their powers to act on that finding.</p> <p>“In doing so, the IOPC shows that it suffers the very sickness within its own ranks that it purports to diagnose within the Met.”</p> <p>Morgan, 37, was found murdered on 10 March 1987 in the car park of the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham.</p> <p>With his business partner, Jonathan Rees, Morgan ran an agency called Southern Investigations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/10/daniel-morgan-how-private-eyes-haunts-britains-powerful-30-years-on\">It would go on to carry out extensive work for the News of the World.</a></p> <p>The panel said the Met was “institutionally corrupt” and placed protecting its reputation over the truth, all charges the force under Dick denied.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<br><br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five investigations by the Met into Morgan’s murder have failed to yield a conviction. Concerns about police wrongdoing, and links between corrupt officers and sections of the tabloid media, led the government to order the Leveson inquiry in 2013 after The Guardian’s revelations about phone hacking.</p> <p>Dick, an assistant commissioner when the Morgan panel started its inquiry, was supposed to make good on the Met promise to fully cooperate with the panel, which was given no statutory powers to investigate and was thus reliant on those they were investigating agreeing to hand over evidence.</p> <p>The panel accused the force of placing concerns about its reputation above properly confronting corruption. It said the Met misled the public and Morgan’s grieving family, exacerbating their pain.</p> <p>The panel criticised police delays in giving access to a database with relevant documents, called “Holmes”, and Dick is named as one of those responsible. “The panel has never received any reasonable explanation for the refusal over seven years by [then] assistant commissioner Dick and her successors to provide access to the Holmes accounts to the Daniel Morgan independent panel,” they said.</p> <p>Sal Naseem, the regional director for London at the IOPC, said: “We are acutely aware that not one single officer was ever successfully prosecuted or received significant disciplinary action as a result of corruption directly connected to the murder investigations.</p> <p>“The wrongs that occurred can never be put right, but it may have served as some small comfort to Mr Morgan’s family and loved ones if the officers involved had been held to account and suffered the consequences of their actions at the time.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/13/family-of-murdered-daniel-morgan-to-sue-met-for-damages?CMP=fb_gu&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR1DyrNRCxFoQ2A2Sc536Khs-HO8kbQaC-OzPszCNH-CsDRW4atbOpYjnCs\">The Morgan family are suing the Met for damages.</a></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/03/taiwan-nancy-pelosi-visit-ukraine-us","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T15:33:28Z","webTitle":"In Taiwan, as in Ukraine, the west is flirting with disaster | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/taiwan-nancy-pelosi-visit-ukraine-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/taiwan-nancy-pelosi-visit-ukraine-us","fields":{"headline":"In Taiwan, as in Ukraine, the west is flirting with disaster","trailText":"It’s one thing to declare yourself ‘rather dead than red’, quite another to inflict that decision on the rest of us, says Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins","byline":"Simon Jenkins","body":"<p>Arguments in the foothills of war are always the same. Those for war shout loudest and beat their chests, eager for tanks to rumble and jets to roar. Those against are dismissed as wimps, appeasers and defeatists. When the trumpets sound and the drums beat, reason runs for cover.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-in-taiwan-calls-for-calm-in-asia-as-us-china-tensions-rise-north-korea-south-korea\">visit to Taiwan</a> of the US congressional speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has been so blatantly provocative it seems little more than a midterm election stunt. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/pelosi-oped-defends-taiwan-visit\">declares</a> it “essential that America and her allies make clear that we never give in to autocrats”. China’s gross overreaction is a classic example of precipitate escalation. Yet when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/biden-taiwan-china-us-defence\">Joe Biden asserted</a> that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, the president’s office instantly backtracked, reasserting a policy of “strategic ambiguity”. It remains the case that no one quite believes the US will go to war over Taiwan – so far.</p> \n<p>A similar ambiguity infuses the west’s attitude towards Russia over Ukraine. The US and Britain reiterate that Russia “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/russia-johnson-munich-security-conference-putin-ukraine\">must fail and be seen to fail</a>”. But can Russia really be relied on to tolerate ever greater destruction of its armaments without escalation? The west seems set on holding Ukraine to a drawn game, hoping to postpone some horrific penalty shootout. All Russia can do is perpetrate ever more atrocities to keep its team in play. Suppose it escalates something else?</p> \n<p>These are the same uncertainties that overwhelmed European diplomacy in 1914. Rulers dithered while generals strutted and rattled sabres. Flags flew and newspapers filled with tallies of weaponry. Negotiations slithered into ultimatums. As the frontline pleaded for help, woe betide anyone who preached compromise.</p> \n<p>During the two east-west nuclear crises of the cold war, in 1962 over Cuba and 1983 over a false missile alarm, disaster was averted by informal lines of communication between Washington and Moscow. They worked. Those lines reportedly do not exist today. The eastern bloc is led by two autocrats, internally secure but paranoid about their borders.</p> \n<p>The west is blighted by weakened and failing leaders, striving to boost their ratings by promoting conflicts abroad. What is new is the conversion of the old western imperialism into a new order of western “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-op-ed/\">interests and values</a>”, ready to be prayed in aid of any intervention.</p> \n<p>Such an order has become arbitrary and knows no boundaries. Despite Pelosi’s claim, the west “gives in” at its own convenience, intervening or failing to do so. Hence wayward policies towards Iran, Syria, Libya, Rwanda, Myanmar, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and others. Britain abandoned Hong Kong to China and donated Afghanistan to the Taliban, the futility of the latter intervention shown last week in the drone killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/us-strike-afghanistan-kills-al-qaida-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri\">al-Qaida’s leader in Kabul</a>. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4cd02ee2-8770-47bb-947e-d4e0a4a3b2bb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j3wrCuULF4c?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Never in my lifetime has the Ministry of Defence had to defend my country against a remotely plausible overseas threat, least of all from Russia or China. Instead, in the cause of “interests and values” it has killed untold thousands of foreigners in my name and to virtually no gain.</p> \n<p>Now, with the looming threat of a serious east-west confrontation, the least we should expect of Britain’s probable next prime minister, Liz Truss, is that she drops her cliches and articulates clearly what she sees as Britain’s objectives, if any, in Ukraine and Taiwan.</p> \n<p>Neither country is a formal ally of Britain or critical to its defence. Horror at Russian aggression justified military aid to Kyiv, but that was a humanitarian rather than strategic response. Probably the greatest aid we can be to Ukraine is to assist in the eventual return of its exiled labour force and help in rebuilding its shattered cities. Taiwan likewise merits sympathy in its historic struggle with China, but its status poses no military threat to Britain. Its population has long been content with an ambiguous relationship with China as it knows it is at its long-term mercy.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/30/china-royal-navy-south-china-sea-warning-beijing\">dispatch</a> of the aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth to the South China Sea last year was a senseless act of vanity.</p> \n<p>Russia and China are both experiencing border disputes of the sort that occur in most corners of the world. Outsiders rarely assist their resolution. The days when western powers could ordain the spheres of interest of states such as China and Russia are rightly over, as was acknowledged during the cold war. Since that conflict ended, the west’s global interventions have become parodies of imperial outreach, notably across the Muslim world. With few exceptions, neither China nor Russia has shown a comparable desire to possess the world. They have merely desired, however callously, to repossess ancestral neighbours.</p> \n<p>The fates of Ukraine and Taiwan merit every diplomatic support but they cannot be allowed to lurch downhill towards global war or nuclear catastrophe. This may reduce the effect – always overstated – of nuclear deterrence, and make them vulnerable to blackmail. But it is one thing to declare yourself “rather dead than red”, quite another to inflict that decision on others.</p> \n<p>It may be that one day a global war, like global heating, delivers the world a catastrophe it may have to confront. For the time being liberal democracy surely owes it to humanity to avert rather than provoke that risk. Both sides are now flirting with disaster. The west should be ready to back off – and not call it defeat.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p></li> \n <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s an odd question, but “reaction videos” – watching people experience emotions as they watch other people doing things – have become a respectable genre of entertainment. It becomes a bit dizzying when you think about it: will we soon have reaction videos of people watching reaction videos? That nesting of images within themselves is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_abyme\">“mise en abyme</a>” in French: placing in the abyss, which provokes a suitably existential shiver.</p> <p>That is not to say I don’t enjoy the simple pleasure of watching kids discover and appreciate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/28/do-you-remember-the-first-time-the-joys-of-youtube-reaction-videos-phil-collins-in-the-air-tonight\">old white man music</a>, Italian chefs condemn Jamie Oliver’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNDbvUPQLA\">crimes against carbonara</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53me-ICi_f8\">Malaysian comedians objecting violently to the BBC’s fried rice</a>. I also appreciate the sterling work of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tegareacts\">Tegareacts</a>, a TikTok sensation. (Can you say TikTok without “sensation”? It has become like “flaunting” and “curves”, I think.) Tega sublimates the most banal videos of cleaning hacks, recipes and the kind of obscure household products you get on shopping channels with pithy commentary. She approves them with her catchphrase “continue”, or occasionally condemns with a firm “discontinue this activity”. My favourite is some lethal-looking <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tegareacts/video/7114781725837905194\">mountain biking</a>, of which she, delightfully, says, “the mass is not mass-ing, the gravity is not gravity-ing”, neatly summarising my objections to extreme sport.</p> <p>Watching watchers started on Japanese television in the 1970s, and the New York Times dates the contemporary version to 2007; the time a decent proportion of us began using social media to look to people other than those around us to reflect our thoughts and feelings. Gogglebox took “watching people watching people on TV” mainstream in 2013, introducing a demographic who might never look at YouTube or TikTok to the concept.</p> <p>Now it feels as if we are going deeper. Why? I’m inclined to blame Covid, which confined much of our emotional life – new babies, birthdays, funerals, even deathbed goodbyes – to a screen, and deprived us of the simple joy of people-watching. Covid sport – and particularly the closed-doors Tokyo Olympics – allowed us to enjoy the wholesome sight of families wildly celebrating the success of faraway athletes: use the volume button wisely if you watch the video of the Tunisian swimmer Ahmed Hafnaoui’s family <a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/tunisian-olympic-gold-medal-swimmer-family-reaction\">watching him win gold</a>.</p> <p>I’m never inclined to worry about what the internet has done to our brains, probably because mine has already been destroyed by angry seagull videos, Twitter fights and my usual 45 open browser windows. But online reaction is becoming a codified and formulaic genre, so much so that one set of reaction-content creators even <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35459805\">tried to trademark the concept</a>. Emotions are exaggerated, nuance is blunted, and expressions and gestures can be reduced to a <a href=\"https://www.myfavoritetoys.com/autism_faces.html\">Thomas the Tank Engine</a> taxonomy: happy, sad, angry, thigh-slap with hilarity, tear your headphones off and walk away in astonishment. The feeling that we are performing, rather than feeling, emotion is a recognisable but deeply uncomfortable one: the abyss is calling.</p> <p>I think there are gentler ways to explain our desire to watch other people feel stuff. One is that we are all tentative, insecure creatures; now more than ever, after nearly three years in which other people have felt distant and been consistently presented as not just strange, but risky. We don’t understand others, but we do look to them for the reassurance that we are the same in some essential way. How they feel about pineapple on pizza, Bohemian Rhapsody or Simone Biles nailing a gravity-defying bit of acrobatics gives us comfort and confirms our own responses are normal.</p> <p>Another theory is that watching reactions is a seeking-out of connection. There is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865077/\">some evidence </a>that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2013/aug/23/mirror-neurons\">mirror neurons</a> in our brains, which activate when we do something and also when we see someone else do the same thing, may operate in the same way with emotions: when we see someone experience pain or disgust or joy, we “feel” it, sort of. That would make watching people react an exercise in empathy.</p> <p>Whatever the mechanism, it shows that we care what others feel. I’m reminded that when my grandparents first got a TV in the 1960s, my grandfather angled his chair away from the screen, so he could watch my grandmother watching it. He would rather, he said, watch her than anything else.

Chinese officials warned the House speaker, unsubtly, that “those who play with fire will perish by it.”</p> <p>“Have you seen California? That’s not the threat it once was, China,” Colbert joked.</p> <p>China warned its military “won’t sit by idly” if Pelosi visited Taiwan, and warned “no matter for what reason Pelosi goes to Taiwan, it will be a stupid, dangerous and unnecessary gamble.”</p> <p>“That’s ominous,” said Colbert. “Also a perfect slogan for White Castle.”</p> <p>Furthermore, the Chinese military conducted live-fire drills in the South China Sea and scrambled jets as Pelosi’s plane landed in Taiwan. “All of this for an 82-year-old woman with bones made of peanut brittle,” Colbert mused. “Tensions are so bad the defense department has upgraded its readiness to Defcon Mee-maw.”</p> <p>Pelosi arrived in Taiwan safely, as the Chinese government reiterated that US politicians who “play with fire” on Taiwanese independence will “come to no good end”.</p> <p>“That threat started out very scary and ended up being very vague,” said Colbert. “We’ll have more on this story if humanity continues to exist.”</p> <p>Colbert also touched on the US drone strike in Kabul that killed Zawahiri. “We haven’t had a win like this since we got Bin Laden 11 years ago,” Colbert exclaimed. “So play some LMFAO on my slightly different iPhone and throw Girl With the Dragon Tattoo on the Blu-ray, because I’m partying like it’s 2011!

None of his family members were hurt, and there were no civilian casualties.”</p> <p>“OK, that’s cool, but shouldn’t that be the goal of all military operations?” Colbert responded. “That’s like a doctor saying ‘the surgery was a total success, Mr Johnson.

But the real point is that retraining the way the brain and body communicate with each other appears to bring real relief to chronic sufferers.</p> <p><strong>How does it work? </strong>The theory is that the brain’s map of the body gets “smudged”, meaning sufferers’ pain systems becomes hypersensitive. Physiotherapists put people with long-term lower back pain through a 12-week “sensorimotor” retraining programme to address that.</p> <p><strong>A what now? </strong>They started out using exercises such as showing participants pictures and asking them to identify if the people in them were turning left or right. Magically, that activates the same neural pathways as actual movement. Later, they moved on to exercises such as lunges and squats.</p> <p><strong>And that worked? </strong>It did! Those on the sensorimotor programme reported a decrease in pain on average from 5.6 to 3.1 on a scale of zero to 10. “People were happier, they reported their backs felt better and their quality of life was better. It also looks like these effects were sustained over the long term,” said Prof James McAuley of the University of New South Wales.</p> <p><strong>How robust is this research?</strong> It was a small trial – 276 participants – but a randomised controlled one, so a control group got “sham” treatments, such as lasers.</p> <p><strong>Lasers!

These would in effect have watered down the pay packets offered to officials seeking new contracts outside London and the south-east, given the relatively lower cost of living away from the capital.</p> <p>Sunak’s supporters immediately seized on the policy as an example of “levelling down” – with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/08/houchenism-the-brand-of-can-do-tory-threatening-the-left-and-right-old-guard\">Tory mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Houchen</a>, saying millions of nurses, police officers and armed forces would effectively face a pay cut. While Truss’s campaign claimed the criticism was a “wilful misrepresentation”, they U-turned less than 24 hours later and said the proposal would not be “taken forward”.</p> <p>But it is not the only policy touted by the two candidates to be prime minister that might not stand up to greater scrutiny.</p> <h2><strong>Liz Truss’s pledges</strong></h2> <h2>Tax cuts</h2> <p>Tax has been a key dividing line in the contest, with Truss promising to cancel the 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions earmarked to pay for the increase in NHS and social care, which came into force in April. She has also pledged to cancel a sharp corporation tax rise slated for next year.</p> <p>She has suggested the plans will help tackle the cost of living crisis – but the Resolution Foundation has pointed out that only 15% of the benefits of the NICs cut will go to the poorest half of the population, who will be hit hardest by energy price rises.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d989d9ab917f6edc7aa718d3968064386b7ee439\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d989d9ab917f6edc7aa718d3968064386b7ee439/0_234_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss has her picture taken with supporters at an event in Ludlow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss has her picture taken with supporters at an event in Ludlow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, it has been suggested repeatedly that unfunded tax cuts could boost inflation, forcing the Bank of England to push up interest rates – perhaps not to 7%, as her economic guru Patrick Minford suggested, but by more than they would otherwise, the Resolution Foundation suggesting perhaps to 1 percentage point.</p> <h2>Cutting crime by 20%</h2> <p>Truss has pledged to oversee a reduction in key crimes by 20% before the end of the parliament and that data on homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime will be published force by force. Those statistics are already collected by the government and the announcement did not offer any new resources or say how such a dramatic reduction could be achieved.</p> <p>Sir Peter Fahy, the ex-chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said targets had been shown to create perverse incentives where officers concentrated on easier wins to boost stats and not complex cases or the most vulnerable.</p> <p>The Truss plans are similar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/11/police-in-england-and-wales-face-targets-in-return-for-20000-new-officers\">measures discussed by senior Home Office officials and police chiefs</a> in late 2020 and 2021, but which were not enacted.</p> <h2><strong>Rishi Sunak’s pledges</strong></h2> <h2>Cut taxes by 20% by the end of the next parliament</h2> <p>Team Truss called this a U-turn by Sunak who had previously warned against promising immediate tax cuts, but it is a less obvious one than his pledge to cut VAT on energy bills, which he refused to do as chancellor. The most obvious gap in this policy is the feasibility of making promises about what tax cuts can or can’t be made in as far away as 2029, without any idea of the fiscal situation.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that while it is a substantial cut, it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Sunak as chancellor, which was “comfortably more than twice as large”. Sunak’s new policy would still leave the total tax take, as a proportion of national income, at its highest level since around the early 1950s.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/31/rishi-sunak-pledges-20-tax-cut-by-end-of-decade-in-last-gasp-pitch-to-members\">Sunak’s offer</a> is made because the Treasury has “headroom” before it breaches fiscal rules on borrowing.

The approach appears to be aimed at incentivising patients not to skip appointments lightly; but it was criticised by doctors’ leaders and healthcare policy experts.</p> <p>The NHS Confederation warned that the costs of administering the scheme were likely to outweigh the money raised, and suggested it was more important to deal with the reasons people are unable to attend, with home visits and evening appointments, for example.</p> <p>The BMA said it would break the principle that primary care is free at the point of use, while failing to tackle the real problems the NHS faces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Prevent</h2> <p>Sunak said people who vilify the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/former-counter-terrorism-police-chief-attacks-rishi-sunaks-prevent-plans\">should be treated as extremists</a> and referred to the government’s deradicalisation programme, Prevent.

While Sunak’s campaign stressed that criticism of the government or its policies would not be included, concerns were raised that it would risk “straying into thought crimes” and further damage Prevent’s reputation.</p> <p>His announcement also made no mention of far-right extremism, which parliament’s intelligence and security committee found in its report last month was on an “upward trajectory” and that MI5 had absorbed responsibility for tackling it without the necessary resources.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/03/the-harder-they-come-review-jimmy-cliff-falls-hard-in-visceral-revenge-western","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T15:00:30Z","webTitle":"The Harder They Come review – Jimmy Cliff falls hard in visceral revenge western","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/03/the-harder-they-come-review-jimmy-cliff-falls-hard-in-visceral-revenge-western","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/03/the-harder-they-come-review-jimmy-cliff-falls-hard-in-visceral-revenge-western","fields":{"headline":"The Harder They Come review – Jimmy Cliff falls hard in visceral revenge western","trailText":"Fifty years on, this crime drama of a headstrong singer shooting for his chance of success is as raw and energetic as its reggae soundtrack","byline":"Peter Bradshaw","body":"<p>Perry Henzell’s visceral 1972 Jamaican crime drama exists between the two moods of its two most famous tracks: the aspirational lesson of You Can Get It If You Really Want and the disillusioned downfall-premonition of the title song. The desperado here really wants it, really gets it, comes hard and falls hard. It’s a movie with Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde in its DNA, as well as Sergio Corbucci’s spaghetti western Django, which in one scene is shown getting a rowdy screening at a Kingston cinema.</p> <p>Singer Jimmy Cliff plays Ivan, a gawky country boy who comes to the Jamaican capital Kingston yearning to be a famous reggae star, having lived with his grandmother who has just died; he is virtually penniless after handing over to his mother the paltry amount remaining from his grandmother’s estate, having assured her that this surprisingly small sum is due to her having wanted a “big funeral”. Swaggeringly laidback Ivan gets a job in a repair shop on land owned by the local church and soon takes a shine to Elsa (Janet Bartley), the demure young orphan parishioner being kept, or rather groomed, as a virginal “ward” by a hectoring, controlling preacher (Basil Keane) who is creepily planning to marry her.</p> <p>Ivan and Elsa start their secret affair as Ivan begins his twin careers in music and crime, only to be strangled in both by monopolistic capitalism. He records a catchy single, The Harder They Come, for local recording studio boss Hilton (Bob Charlton), who forces him to accept a flat buyout fee of $20 and blocks him from selling his single directly to radio stations and clubs. When pop stardom fails to materialise, Ivan gets into the ganja distribution business in a small way, retailing pre-rolled spliffs, only to find that the colossally lucrative US export action is sewn up by top mobster Jose (Carl Bradshaw) who collects protection money on behalf of crooked cop Jones (Winston Stona).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gxm19eULVw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3Gxm19eULVw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ivan is humiliated and traumatised by corporal punishment handed down by the courts for a first offence, eight strokes of the tamarind switch – a horribly explicit scene. He then goes on a violent cop-killing rampage to promote his single, which duly becomes a massive hit and he sends photos of himself in cowboy-gunslinger poses to the papers. As the army closes in, Ivan has a new plan, to escape by boat to Cuba, where they will appreciate his radical outlaw vocation: “Revolutionary to Ras …”</p> <p>The reggae soundtrack throbs and crunches and shudders in concert with the raw energy of Henzell’s storytelling and Cliff’s performance, but this doesn’t preclude a shrewdly self-aware debate about representation. At one point Hilton demands to know from Jones if they are banning Ivan’s single. His reply is: “Yes, if it glorifies crime.” Hilton responds: “Banning it from the hit parade? That’s when you make the guy into a big deal.” Of course, it is in Hilton’s interests for Ivan to be a big deal, although unlike the American papers who published what Bonnie and Clyde sent them, the Jamaican press is far more obedient.</p> <p>When pious Christian Elsa tells her big-talking boyfriend that he is a “dreamer”, Ivan snaps back: “Who’s a bigger dreamer than you? Always talking about milk and honey in the sky. Well, no milk and honey in the sky! No, not for you, not for me. It’s right down here, and I want mine now, tonight!” Ivan may not be an existential hero, but he knows he is going to die in the very near future, and this conviction accelerates his celebrity and his fanatical devotion to the swiftly dwindling present moment of defiant self-awareness: he daubs graffiti all over town proclaiming that he is there. His fall is indeed hard (though no harder than those of his police officer victims whose deaths are heartlessly all but ignored).

Or does it?</p> <p>Scientists have developed a way to restore function in pig organs an hour after their hearts have stopped beating, raising fresh questions about the nature of death and pointing to ways to improve organ transplantation rates.</p> <p>For decades, scientists had assumed that a flatlining heart, and the deficit of oxygen and nutrients that it brings, triggers a cascade of events leading to irreparable cell death and damage to vital organs.</p> <p>But in 2019, Prof Nenad Sestan at Yale University and his colleagues announced a technique to restore some degree of function to cells in pig brains up to six hours after death, by pumping a form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/17/scientists-reboot-pig-brain-hours-after-animals-died-yale-university-researchers?fbclid=IwAR3gtLT7qSXNlpfyTNrvgsfwf3p63g_XGA_q41nV9TUgpmADagUC052j518\">synthetic blood</a> called cryoprotective perfusate through their blood vessels.</p> <p>As well as delivering oxygen and nutrients, it contained drugs and other substances to protect cells against injury and prevent blood clots. Even though the pigs’ brains showed no signs of consciousness, the study provided proof of principal that the irreparable cell damage caused by death, might not be so irreparable.</p> <p>Now, the same team has achieved a similar feat in other organs. Their updated device, OrganEx, restored circulation and improved the function of cells in the hearts, brains, livers and kidneys of pigs that had died from heart attacks an hour earlier. It also activated programmes involved in cellular repair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The research, published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05016-1\">Nature</a>, highlights a previously unappreciated capacity of the body to partially recover after disrupted blood flow, the researchers said.</p> <p>“These cells are functioning hours after they should not be. What [this] tells us is that the demise of cells can be halted and their functionality restored in multiple vital organs, even one hour after death,” said Sestan.</p> <p>“These results open the door for future transplantation studies and possible treatments for ischemic damage [where blood flow to vital organs is disrupted].”</p> <p>Currently, the best way to restore oxygen and nutrient delivery to deprived organs and tissues is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), where blood is pumped through a machine that removes carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-filled blood back into the body.</p> <p>However, when Sestan’s team examined organs from pigs that had undergone ECMO treatment an hour after their hearts stopped beating, they discovered that many of the smaller vessels supplying oxygen to these tissues had collapsed. Organs that had undergone OrganEx treatment appeared to be less damaged, and there were even signs of repair in the kidneys.</p> <p>“This is a truly remarkable and incredibly significant study. It demonstrates that after death, cells in mammalian organs (including humans) such as the brain do not die for many hours – well into the postmortem period,” said Dr Sam Parnia, associate professor of critical care medicine at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.</p> <p>“By developing this system of organ preservation, in the near future doctors will be able to provide novel treatments to preserve the organs postmortem. This will enable access to many more organs for transplantation, which will lead to thousands of lives saved every year.”</p> <p>Further into the future, it might even be possible to support organ function in people who have died, for example as a result of drowning, heart attacks or massive bleeding after a car accident, and bring them back to life hours later, once doctors have repaired the damage, he added.</p> <p>Sestan’s team cautioned that further animal experiments would be necessary, before tests in human organs could be initiated. Even then, it would likely be many years before a deceased person was ever hooked up to the device.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/03/roy-hackett-civil-rights-hero-britain-bristol-bus-boycott","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:51:27Z","webTitle":"Roy Hackett was a civil rights hero – everyone in Britain should know his name | Olivette Otele","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/roy-hackett-civil-rights-hero-britain-bristol-bus-boycott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/roy-hackett-civil-rights-hero-britain-bristol-bus-boycott","fields":{"headline":"Roy Hackett was a civil rights hero – everyone in Britain should know his name","trailText":"The activist who led the groundbreaking 1960s Bristol bus boycott embodied the spirit of radical resilience and hope, says Olivette Otele of Soas University of London","byline":"Olivette Otele","body":"<p>A Black pioneer has joined his ancestors: one of Britain’s most celebrated civil right activists, Roy Hackett, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/bristol-bus-boycott-campaigner-roy-hackett-dies-at-93\">has passed away</a>. The whole country should know his name and be taught the extraordinary story of one of the most powerful organised resistance movements against racial discrimination in 20th-century Britain. It is a story of community determination, collaboration and hope. </p> <p>I met Hackett when I was a PhD student working on the links between the city of Bristol and the transatlantic slave trade. He emphatically congratulated me on tackling a subject that was bound to make many feel uncomfortable but that could also lead to a form of healing. He believed that it was important for younger generations of people of African, Caribbean and Asian descent to actively participate in the writing of the history of the city and of the UK. Following in the footsteps of US pioneers such as <a href=\"https://www.digitalforsyth.org/photos/9039\">Charlie Brady Hauser</a> (who was the father of the first Black female lord-lieutenant of Bristol, <a href=\"https://www.lordltbristol.org.uk/\">Peaches Golding</a>) and Rosa Parks, Hackett knew that you could not fight against what is now known as institutionalised racism without careful planning.</p> <p>Britain, and Bristol in particular, was a very difficult place for people of African and Asian descent in the 1950s and 1960s. It was common for members of those communities to be denied access to hostels, boarding houses, pubs and so on. Physical violence from racist gangs was also a threat. Many from those communities had been invited to help build the mother country, and yet they faced dehumanising discrimination.</p> <p>While other cities had started to hire people from African-Caribbean and Asian communities in various roles, the Bristol Omnibus Company, supported by the council, openly refused to do so. So, in the early 1960s, Hackett, Guy Bailey and many other activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/06/roy-hackett-the-civil-rights-hero-who-stood-in-front-of-a-bus-and-changed-britain-for-ever\">got together</a> and canvassed the support of Bristol’s wider Black community in St Paul’s, where most of them lived. In 1963, Hackett, Audley Evans, Owen Henry, Prince Brown and Paul Stephenson set up the <a href=\"https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/civil-rights-movement/the-bristol-bus-boycott-of-1963/\">West Indian Development Council</a>: its aim was to raise awareness about employment discrimination and conduct series of targeted actions. In the same year, they launched a city-wide boycott of the Omnibus Company’s buses. Trinidad and Tobago’s high commissioner, Learie Constantine, and British politicians such as Tony Benn supported it. As the fight made local and national news, more and more people wanted to get involved. After months of boycott, <a href=\"https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/civil-rights-movement/the-bristol-bus-boycott-of-1963/\">the company announced</a> there would be no more discrimination in employing bus crews.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/bristol-bus-boycott-campaigner-roy-hackett-dies-at-93\">Bristol bus boycott campaigner Roy Hackett dies at 93</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hackett (who was also instrumental in setting up St Paul’s Carnival in Bristol) and his companions did not achieve their goals and end that form of segregation by simply wishing it to happen. They organised sit-ins, pickets, galvanised crowds and publicised their stories. It was done in the spirit of non-violence that inspired Dr Martin Luther King Jr’s journey. They constantly sought the support of people from all backgrounds. A fierce leader, Roy Hackett embodied the spirit of radical resilience and hope.

At a Republican debate, he questioned the validity of Griswold, the pertinent 1965 supreme court ruling. For good measure, DePerno previously spearheaded efforts to undo Biden’s 150,000-vote win in Michigan.</p> <p>Tuesday’s contests were also about the 45th president exacting revenge and promoting the “big lie” – that he was defrauded of victory.</p> <p>To be sure, not all Republicans were buying what the former guy was selling. But he had greater success than Kansas’s pro-lifers. Trumpism remains very much alive.</p> <p>In the state of Washington, incumbents Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse stand on the verge of rebuffing primary bids by Trump-endorsed challengers. Both Representatives Herrera Beutler and Newhouse voted to impeach the ex-reality show host over his role in the January 6 insurrection.</p> <p>On the other hand, Michigan’s Representative Peter Meijer, who voted for Trump’s impeachment, lost to John Gibbs, a Trump-backed challenger. Gibbs had received <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/us/politics/democrats-john-gibbs-peter-meijer.html\">a boost from congressional Democrats</a>, as part of an audacious strategic move to empower Republicans they think will lose in the general elections. Meijer, a supermarket chain scion, lost by four points.</p> <p>With the rightwing Gibbs as the Republican nominee, the Democrats may actually pick up a House seat. Had Meijer emerged with the Republican nod, he would have been favored. All this raises the question of whether Democratic talk about putting the country ahead of party is partisan blather.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Trump claimed the head of Republican Rusty Bowers, the outgoing speaker of the Arizona senate. He had opposed efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and appeared before the January 6 select committee.</p> <p>Days after Bowers testified, Trump declared: “Bowers must be defeated, and highly respected David Farnsworth is the man to do it.”</p> <p>Farnsworth believes that Satan stole the 2020 election. Really.</p> <p>“This is a real conspiracy headed up by the devil himself,” he explained at a debate.</p> <p>Along with Farnsworth, Mark Finchem, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/08/02/us/elections-arizona-primary-michigan/mark-finchem-beau-lane-arizona-election?smid=url-share\">diehard election denier and conspiracy theorist</a>, notched the Arizona Republican nomination for secretary of state. He too had Trump’s blessing.</p> <p>As for the state’s Republican primary for governor, Kari Lake holds a two-point lead with more than 80% of precincts reporting. Like Finchem and Farnsworth, Lake garnered a Trump endorsement and rejects Biden’s legitimacy as president. Whether she actually wins the primary and can prevail against Democrat Katie Hobbs, the current secretary of state, remains to be seen.</p> <p>With Kansas’s resounding no vote, Democrats have good reason to make abortion a major issue for the midterms. Of course, as Republicans learned on Tuesday, it is all too easy to go off the deep-end.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lloyd Green is a regular contributor and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/03/uk-inflation-could-reach-15-by-start-of-2023-experts-say","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:46:11Z","webTitle":"UK inflation could reach 15% by start of 2023, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/uk-inflation-could-reach-15-by-start-of-2023-experts-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/03/uk-inflation-could-reach-15-by-start-of-2023-experts-say","fields":{"headline":"UK inflation could reach 15% by start of 2023, experts say","trailText":"Resolution Foundation says Bank of England likely to forecast higher and later peak, on eve of interest rates decision","byline":"Larry Elliott","body":"<p>The UK’s annual inflation could go as high as 15% by the start of 2023, experts have forecast, as further sharp increases in energy prices push up the cost of living.</p> <p>On the eve of the latest decision on interest rates by the Bank of England, the <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/in-the-dread-of-winter/\">Resolution Foundation</a> thinktank said price pressures were likely to be stronger and last longer than the Bank had previously forecast.</p> <p>The Bank’s monetary policy committee – which said in June that it expected inflation to peak at just over <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2022/june-2022\">11% in October </a>– is poised to raise official borrowing costs on Thursday for a sixth successive month despite signs that the economy is weakening.</p> <p>The latest monthly health check of the service sector from S&amp;P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply found activity among private firms operating in the service sector has fallen to its lowest level since the winter lockdown of early 2021.</p> <p>Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Reduced levels of discretionary consumer spending and efforts by businesses to contain expenses due to escalating inflation have combined to squeeze demand across the service economy.</p> <p>“The near-term outlook also looks subdued, as new order growth held close to June’s 16-month low and business optimism was the second weakest since May 2020.”</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation pointed to some good news on inflation, as some commodity prices fell, including oil, but this was being more than offset by the rising cost of gas.

For example, skin cells from a leukaemia patient could potentially be transformed into bone marrow stem cells to treat their condition.</p> <p>“Remarkably, we show that embryonic stem cells generate whole synthetic embryos, meaning this includes the placenta and yolk sac surrounding the embryo,” said Prof Jacob Hanna, who led the effort. “We are truly excited about this work and its implications.” The work is <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00981-3?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&amp;utm_campaign=492bf84a1c-MR_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-492bf84a1c-149563237\">published in Cell</a>.</p> <p>Last year, the same team described how they had built a mechanical womb that enabled natural mouse embryos to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03416-3\">grow outside the uterus</a> for several days. In the latest work, the same device was used to nurture mouse stem cells for more than a week, nearly half the gestation time for a mouse.</p> <p>Some of the cells were pre-treated with chemicals, which switched on genetic programmes to develop into placenta or yolk sac, while others developed without intervention into organs and other tissues.</p> <p>While most of the stem cells failed to form embryo-like structures, about 0.5% combined into little balls that grew distinct tissues and organs. When compared with natural mouse embryos, the synthetic embryos were 95% the same in terms of their internal structure and the genetic profiles of the cells. As far as the scientists could tell, the organs that formed were functional.</p> <p>Hanna said synthetic embryos were not “real” embryos and did not have the potential to develop into live animals, or at least they hadn’t when they had been transplanted into the wombs of female mice.

This is providing an ethical and technical alternative to the use of embryos,” Hanna said.</p> <p>Dr James Briscoe, a principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who was not involved in the research, said it was important to discuss how best to regulate the work before human synthetic embryos were developed.</p> <p>“Synthetic human embryos are not an immediate prospect. We know less about human embryos than mouse embryos and the inefficiency of the mouse synthetic embryos suggests that translating the findings to human requires further development,” Briscoe said.</p> <p>But, he added: “Now is a good time to consider the best legal and ethical framework to regulate research and use of human synthetic embryos and to update the current regulations.”</p> <p>Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/01/synthetic-mouse-embryos-created-from-stem-cells-without-sperm-eggs-uterus/?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&amp;utm_campaign=492bf84a1c-MR_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-492bf84a1c-149563237\">StatNews</a>, Prof Paul Tesar, a geneticist at Case Western Reserve University, said the more scientists pushed stem cell-derived embryos further and further along the path of development, the more the synthetic and natural embryos begin to merge.</p> <p>“There will always be a grey area,” he said. “But as scientists and as a society we need to come together to decide where the line is and define what is ethically acceptable.”</p> <p>The creation of “synthetic” human embryos is outside of the legal framework of the UK’s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, but it would be unlawful to use them to establish a pregnancy in a woman, because they are not classed as “permitted embryos”. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/03/mabia-aktar-raising-the-bar-for-female-empowerment-in-bangladesh","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:40:38Z","webTitle":"Mabia Aktar raising the bar for female empowerment in Bangladesh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/03/mabia-aktar-raising-the-bar-for-female-empowerment-in-bangladesh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/03/mabia-aktar-raising-the-bar-for-female-empowerment-in-bangladesh","fields":{"headline":"Mabia Aktar raising the bar for female empowerment in Bangladesh","trailText":"The weightlifter Mabia Aktar has overcome financial hardship in Bangladesh to compete at the Commonwealth Games and raise the bar for female empowerment","byline":"Jessica Murray","body":"<p>It was from the most unlikely of beginnings that the 22-year-old Mabia Aktar became a sporting star and symbol of female empowerment in her home country of Bangladesh for her success in weightlifting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/track-stars-will-regret-missing-commonwealth-games-say-organisers\">Track stars will regret missing Commonwealth Games, say organisers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Growing up in rural Khilgaon, her family faced financial hardship. Aktar was forced to stop going to school and struggled to eat the nutrition she needed to be able to train. Now she is a double gold medallist in the South Asian games, and this week she competed in her first Commonwealth Games as her country’s flagbearer.</p> <p>Aktar exceeded expectations by coming eighth in the 64kg category, matching her national record with a total of 181kg. Before her success, female participation in weightlifting in majority-Muslim Bangladesh was largely unheard of and she often faced criticism and discrimination for taking part.</p> <p>“I’m trying to perform in a way so that others females can come forward and join weightlifting or other sports. I want to see others coming up and sharing the same platform as me,” she said.</p> <p>“I don’t feel gender is much of an issue for me any more, I get equal support from the authorities. It’s just about delivering the best results possible.”</p> <p>In recent years she has been able to rely on the support of Bangladesh’s government. The country has been led by female prime ministers for most of the past 30 years, and under the current leader Sheikh Hasina its annual gross domestic product has tripled since 2009.</p> <p>During that time the opportunities for women to participate in sport has increased rapidly. Bangladesh women’s cricket team is now ranked one of the best in the world, and are Asia Cup champions. Of the 31 athletes who attended the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham this week, 11 were women.</p> <p>“The Bangladesh government is facilitating women in sport and making us feel empowered,” Aktar said. “This extra interest in women coming forward means we’re now working hand-in-hand with the gents.”</p> <p>Born in Madaripur, Aktar was introduced to weightlifting through her uncle at a young age. With all the challenges she faced in being able to train, she attributes her success to the support of her family. She hopes that the support for female sport by the Bangladeshi government means other female athletes will not have to overcome the same hurdles she faced. </p> <p>“I want to see more girls will come forward to do weightlifting, and one day I want to see athletes from Bangladesh get a chance to compete at the Olympics and win some medals,” she said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/03/cocaine-and-opiates-drive-record-high-drug-deaths-in-england-and-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:39:13Z","webTitle":"Opiates drive drug deaths to record level in England and Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/03/cocaine-and-opiates-drive-record-high-drug-deaths-in-england-and-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/03/cocaine-and-opiates-drive-record-high-drug-deaths-in-england-and-wales","fields":{"headline":"Opiates drive drug deaths to record level in England and Wales","trailText":"Death rate rises for ninth year in a row as cocaine-related deaths increase sevenfold since 2011","byline":"Tobi Thomas","body":"<p>Drug-related deaths have reached a record level across England and Wales as a growing number of people die after using opiates and cocaine, official figures show.</p> <p>In 2021, 4,859 people were recorded as having died from drug poisoning, the equivalent of 84.4 deaths per million people, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.</p> <p>This is 6.2% higher than the rate for 2020, the ninth consecutive annual rise and the highest number since records began in 1993.</p> <p>The figures cover drug dependence, fatal accidents, suicides and complications involving controlled and non-controlled drugs, as well as prescription and over-the-counter medication.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-03-11:05:17/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-03-11:05:17/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Nearly two-thirds of drug poisoning deaths (3,060) in 2021 were related to drug misuse, accounting for 53.2 deaths per million people.</p> <p>Men accounted for more than two-thirds of deaths (3,275) from poisoning, a gender disparity that is consistent with previous years.</p> <p>Those born in the 1970s had a higher rate of drug misuse deaths, with the highest rate found in people aged between 45 and 49.</p> <p>The ONS said the overall rising trend over the past decade had been driven primarily by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/11/risk-of-death-from-drugs-up-55-per-cent-since-2010-after-cuts-to-services\">deaths involving opiates</a>, but also by those involving other substances such as cocaine.</p> <p>More than 45% of all drug poisoning deaths (2,219) involved an opiate, but the steepest rise was related to cocaine use.

It’s a toxic relationship.”</p> <p>Another visual effects artist, who wished to remain anonymous, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/a-vfx-artist-on-what-its-like-working-for-marvel.html\">told New York magazine’s Vulture website</a>: “When I worked on one movie, it was almost six months of overtime every day. I was working seven days a week, averaging 64 hours a week on a good week. Marvel genuinely works you really hard. I’ve had co-workers sit next to me, break down and start crying. I’ve had people having anxiety attacks on the phone.”</p> <p>The unnamed artist described Marvel as so successful, dominant and prolific that visual effects houses scramble to undercut each other in the hope of landing the next commission. But they then tend to be understaffed, trying do more with less. And Marvel is perfectionist to a fault, ordering changes late in the process, far in excess of a typical client.</p> <p>Such testimony comes as little surprise to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joepavlo?lang=en\">Joe Pavlo</a>, an Emmy award-winning visual effects artist based in London. He worked on Guardians of the Galaxy – “it was a mess,” he recalls to the Guardian, “it was crazy,” – and points to the structural reasons why VFX artists, typically working for third-party vendors without collective bargaining rights, get the rough end of the stick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de866abf5ece0903291a1cacfe4032404cc5b4d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de866abf5ece0903291a1cacfe4032404cc5b4d7/0_88_3543_2128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardians Of The Galaxy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardians of the Galaxy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the National Film and Television School</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The visual effects industry is filled with terrific people with lots of goodwill who really care but, at the end of the day, there’s nothing in place when their backs are up against the wall and Disney is making crazy demands,” Pavlo says by phone.</p> <p>“All the goodwill in the world just evaporates when everything gets changed and they decide they’re replacing that character with a different actor or changing the entire environment – they’re now in a pizza restaurant instead of a cornfield. It can be that extreme at the very last minute.”</p> <p>Pavlo, who is from the US but has lived in London since 1984, continues: “It can be characterised as bullying but filtered through multiple layers of management and supervisor and hierarchy.</p> <p>“It’s not like the executive from Disney is grabbing someone and swearing at them or something like that. It’s more like an atmosphere where everybody feels like this is the most desperately important thing and, if we don’t do it, we’re all fucked.</p> <p>“The average artist doesn’t even have any contact with the clients. It’s really just the people at the producer and the supervisor level and then they pass it on to their crew. So you could say, oh, the supervisor’s a real bully, but actually it’s a knock-on effect and then the people who are the team leaders, once they can’t handle it, end up being bullies.</p> <p>“Bullying is a huge problem in our industry because everybody’s so desperate sometimes. It seems like there’s such a high level of stress and pressure on these jobs to complete on time, to change everything at the drop of a hat.”</p> <p>Many artists fear that making a stand about pay and conditions could see them blacklisted. Bringing visual effects workers together under the umbrella of a trade union could be one solution.</p> <p>Pavlo, chair of the animation and visual effects branch at the <a href=\"https://bectu.org.uk/\">Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union</a> (Bectu), adds: “Disney-Marvel is very famous for wanting multiple versions running parallel so that they can decide what they want. A strong union would be able to reel that in a bit.</p> <p>“If you imagine you get the art department to design a set, you wouldn’t get them to tear down the set and rebuild a completely different set 35 times. Because it’s digital, people don’t see it as the same thing but it is: it involves work and creativity and long hours. It doesn’t create itself.”</p> <p>Notably, union organising drives are under way at corporate giants such as Amazon and Starbucks, offering a possible blueprint. Pavlo adds: “If they can do it, all the bosses and clever people in the visual effects industry can figure out how to do it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9f55162b81deb9b1c74cc20ba7f6d14d538a4e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9f55162b81deb9b1c74cc20ba7f6d14d538a4e4/0_3_4690_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Marvel Studios president, Kevin Feige, speaks during the Marvel panel at Comic-Con.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Marvel Studios president, Kevin Feige, speaks during the Marvel panel at Comic-Con.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the Atlantic, there is agreement from <a href=\"https://animationguild.org/meet-tag-organizer-ben-speight/\">Ben Speight</a>, an organiser at the Animation Guild, which represents animation artists, writers and technicians and is part of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.

The Belgian pigeon federation described the outcome as a catastrophe and blamed organisers for allowing the birds to become airborne despite forecasts of bad weather.</p> <p>Pascal Bodengien, the president of the federation, told the public broadcaster VRT: “It’s an emotional drama, a financial drama – it’s quite simply very sad.”</p> <p>He suggested some of the Belgian birds had flown to Germany by accident, adding: “Some of them will come back in the next few days but the majority are definitively lost.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-zip/giv-6562DfNtbz0flzDV/\" data-alt=\"Map of pigeon race that went wrong\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-zip/giv-6562DfNtbz0flzDV/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Didier Tison, a federation spokesperson, said the widely reported figure of 20,000 missing birds was “completely false”. He added that there were about 3,000 to 4,000 lost birds from Belgium, an “exceptional” number, but he was not able to confirm the tally for other countries.</p> <p>Belgium pioneered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/23/pigeon-fanciers-lobby-for-change-to-brexit-rules-on-cross-channel-races\">sport of pigeon racing</a>, where birds released hundreds of miles from home compete to make the speediest return. Racing pigeons wear tracking devices, making it possible to work out which was the fastest bird.</p> <p>It is thought pigeons navigate using the Earth’s magnetic field lines and their sense of smell.</p> <p>However, this finely tuned sense of navigation was thrown into confusion last Friday when, 18 miles (30km) from the start of the race, they flew into a storm that is thought to have left them disoriented and tired.</p> <p>The losses are painful for dedicated pigeon fanciers. Amateurs can spend two to three years raising a bird and thousands of euros on sought-after breeders that will provide the next generation of champions.</p> <p>Luc Henry, a pigeon fancier from Paifve in eastern Belgium, had entered 87 birds into the competition, but only 36 had returned when he spoke to francophone public broadcaster RTBF in an interview broadcast on Tuesday. He said the “pigeons didn’t have a chance” in a race that was “completely distorted”.</p> <p>Ulrich Lemmens, from Balen in Flanders, who had only 15 of the 57 pigeons he entered into the race return, described his losses as truly painful. “In my 13 years as a pigeon fancier, this is the first time this has happened. Three years of work have gone up in smoke. My goal is Barcelona [a prestigious pigeon race] in 2024. But now I can forget it,” he said.</p> <p>Despite the sport’s working-class origins, it is increasingly attracting big money. In 2020, a Chinese buyer <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54953594\">paid a record €1.6m</a> (£1.3m) for a champion racing pigeon from Belgium.</p> <p>Belgium has about 18,000 people who keep pigeons and it is a global centre for the sport. As a result, Belgian groups organise many international competitions, including the disastrous contest in the south of France.</p> <p>After an emergency meeting on Monday, the Belgian pigeon federation called for the resignation of leading officials at the race organisers, Liège Independent.</p> <p>Tison said the Liège pigeon society had broken the rules of the sport and that the mattter would be raised at a meeting with the minister responsible for animal welfare in the regional government of Wallonia on Thursday.</p> <p>The director of Liège Independent, Francine Lageot, issued a formal apology on Belgian TV, saying it was “true that the competition did not go well for different reasons”.</p> <p>But in a statement, Liège Independent hit back at “unfortunate” allegations about its organisation of the race.</p> <p>While admitting one breach of the rules, the organisers said the release of the birds had been agreed with French, Dutch and German officials, and that the Belgian national sports president had been informed.</p> <p>Liège Independent added that the “climatic conditions” in the coming days would have made the competition even more difficult, because of increasing temperatures and violent headwinds.</p> <p>It said: “At 7.20am [last Friday] the pigeons were released in the presence of 40 people.</p> <p>“They took straight away a good direction towards the north. We express enormous sadness at not having achieved the expected result and the proper return of our birds.

White people … Who were the first to put a man on the moon? White people.”</p> <p>Julia Ebner, a senior fellow of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) who researches far-right activism, said similar study guides or reading lists flourished during lockdowns, often distributed through digital channels such as the Telegram messaging app.</p> <p>Ebner, who has gone undercover among extremist groups in the UK, says there is a “far-right ecosystem” operating with the goal of attracting young people and radicalising them to support, or carry out, extreme acts.</p> <p>“They are basically providing materials for school pupils or children to educate themselves on being racist and in antisemitic conspiracy theories,” said Ebner.</p> <p>The groups appeal to young people by promoting gaming tournaments, including hugely popular multiplayer online games such as Call of Duty or Fortnite, as a way of making contact.</p> <p>The younger generation of rightwing extremists deride their predecessors as “dads” for their reliance on rules and hierarchies, says Jacob Davey, an ISD researcher who co-authored an analysis of far-right activity on Discord, a messaging platform originally designed to complement online gaming.</p> <p>These extremists prefer to copy the strategies used by mainstream social media influencers, establishing communities of fans or subscribers and adopting memes and aggressive online trolling. “They’re not going down to the backroom of the shady pub in south London, they are much more likely to be logging on to a Discord server or Telegram chat channel,” said Davey.</p> <p>The analysis found that Discord sometimes “acts as a hub for extreme rightwing socialising and community building”, with an average age of 15 among users on servers associated with far-right activists.</p> <p>The research showed how games served as a means of finding common ground with potential recruits for activities such as trolling “raids” – where groups disrupt online discussions or forums, often by heckling or being abusive, in an effort to subvert the subject or aims and drive away legitimate users and debate.</p> <p>“This semi-organised cyberbullying could be a vector which brings young people into contact with extremist communities,” the report said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/revealed-uk-children-ensnared-far-right-ecosystem-online\">Revealed: UK children being ensnared by ‘far-right ecosystem’ online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Paul Jackson, a professor studying the history of radicalism and extremism at the University of Northampton, said that compared with earlier far-right organisations, “the reality now is something much more messy”.</p> <p>“Young people find messages online that push and promote a moral acceptance that violence is justifiable or acceptable somehow. So people become radicalised, they self-radicalise, it’s a complex picture,” said Jackson.</p> <p>The most enthusiastic participants are invited into private channels on Telegram or chatrooms, where the content is what Ebner calls “traditional far-right” racism and antisemitism.</p> <p>“Often radicalisation happens through this sort of socialisation process, and then ideological indoctrination or radicalisation is a byproduct of becoming part of an appealing subculture, where people use their own insider references and jokes and memes,” she said.</p> <p>“That’s what makes the exploitation of youth culture and pop culture elements so dangerous, especially for children or young people who have been bored or even lonely in the recent lockdowns. I do think that what we are seeing, the radicalisation among young people in extremist groups, is often stemming from that phenomenon.</p> <p>“They have become very savvy in exploiting the youth culture elements and creating very appealing, exclusive online communities, where young people have a sense they can be someone special and in this group they can be entertained. It’s an antidote to boredom but also to loneliness.”</p> <p>Jackson said private channels allow the sharing of “whole collections of online documents that give [young people] a world view and ways to act on it in potentially violent ways. That doesn’t definitely mean that they’ll act in those ways but the ease of access is very notable.”</p> <p>Recent arrests and court appearances in the UK show that police have become more active in charging young people who have allegedly downloaded extremist material, especially documents detailing past extremist attacks such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christchurch-shooting\">2019 mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand</a>, or give instructions in creating explosive devices or weapons.</p> <p>One ideological development that concerns Jackson is the growth of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in\">“accelerationism”</a>: encouraging attacks designed to provoke racial conflict and accelerate the breakdown of existing societal structures. “Over the last 10 years or so, we’ve seen that specific culture pose very significant threats of violence against entirely innocent people,” Jackson said.</p> <p>One adviser to the Home Office, who declined to be identified, warned that young people were still making active decisions to become involved with far-right groups rather than stumbling across the most extreme content.</p> <p>“It’s not the large social networks, for all their faults. They [major technology platforms] have chased the worst stuff off most mainstream networks. The really extreme stuff … is difficult to find on Twitter and Facebook and all the rest of it,” the adviser said.</p> <p>“You’ve got to know where to start looking for that stuff, you’ve got to know the right accounts. They’re not being tricked into being rightwing extremists. And there isn’t some mastermind at the centre pulling the wool over everybody’s eyes.”</p> <p>A wide range of experts who spoke to the Guardian, from Prevent coordinators to counterterrorism officers and school leaders, agreed that the number of young people involved with the extreme right in Britain remained tiny. Home Office figures show that, in each of the last two years, fewer than 200 people aged 20 or younger were adopted into Channel, Prevent’s far-right deradicalisation programme.</p> <p>But Ebner points out that a small number of radicalised people can cause significant damage or violence, as shown by the shootings in Christchurch and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/buffalo-shooting-supermarket-new-york\">in Buffalo, New York</a>.</p> <p>“There might also be bigger problems for the future of our democracy and our political system, if an increasing number of young people endorse ideas like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/08/a-deadly-ideology-how-the-great-replacement-theory-went-mainstream\">‘great replacement’</a>, the belief of whites being taken over by non-whites,” Ebner said. “And I do think that’s a major problem.”</p> <p>The Home Office adviser said young people charged and sentenced for far-right terrorist-related activity could continue to pose a threat after release, often following relatively short sentences. “Unless they’ve got family connections or help, those kids are cut off now. And there’s no way for them to come back. There’s no way for them to atone for what they’ve done or reconnect with society in any meaningful way.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Patriotic Alternative was contacted for comment.

This is his story, as told to </em><em>Sally Weale</em></p> <p>I grew up in a small village on the outskirts of Rotherham. It’s quite a diverse area now, but when I was at school it was predominantly white. I went to the local secondary and it was like five years in the slammer. It was pure torture. I was bullied 24/7.</p> <p>It was just horrible. I started developing anger management issues pretty early on, and then I made some friends in the year above me. They were openly racist, but they protected me at school. They would make Islamophobic comments. I was a big fan of wrestling, and they were wrestling fans, so we’d go from talking about wrestling to talking about Islam. They would pick on the Pakistani guy who ran the local shop. I was on the sidelines watching. I was just a naive little kid.</p> <p>When they left school, it left a void and that’s when I started to look at far-right content online. After school I’d lock myself in my bedroom and get on the internet. I was looking for videos all the time and it’s such a big rabbit hole. With the algorithms, one far-right video leads on to another and another, and the next thing I know I’ve spent hours online.</p> <p>I was a big Minecraft player at the time. It was my last year at school and there was a really bad bullying incident one day and I thought: “Right, I’m going to make these bullies pay for it.” I made the decision that I was going to try to attack and kill some of the bullies.</p> <p>So I built a replica of my school in Minecraft, and I practised going around to the classes where I knew some of the bullies were that I wanted to hurt. On the day I decided to do it, I took a knife out of the bread basket at home. I put it in my bag and I thought: “Some time in maths I’m going to launch my attack.”</p> <p>I remember my heart was pounding. I was starting to sweat. That day one of the bullies was giving me a really hard time, but I remember looking at my bag and thinking: “Don’t do it, it’s not worth it.” And luckily for everyone involved, I chose not to. I put the knife back where it belonged and just carried on.</p> <p>It was all around the time the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/26/rotherham-abuse-report-blatant-failures-of-care-system-condemned\">Jay report [into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham]</a> came out and Britain First did a demo in Rotherham. I became fascinated by it. The online stuff was in its infancy then. The far right were looking at this new tool and seeing how they could use it.</p> <p>I’d been seeing far-right videos online for years. I turned 18 and I felt like it was time to join up. Then in January 2016 I joined Britain First. I think I was missing friendship. I felt lost. I felt like I needed to go there to get some protection from the bullies. I didn’t realise it at the time, but I was struggling with depression.</p> <p>I started going to demonstrations. My first was in Dewsbury. We got flags and banners and we were walking in a big formation into town and it just felt so powerful. It felt like we were unstoppable. The speeches were pure Islamophobia. At first I was nervous, but then it always felt like that layer of protection was there because they have their own security guys.</p> <p>We’d go into a town or city with a large Muslim population – Dewsbury, Leicester, London – and we’d have no idea what the plan was, and we pretty much always got a hostile reaction. I got addicted to that adrenaline rush. I’d always get psyched up. You’d be in the car or on the train, and you’d feel butterflies in your stomach and you couldn’t wait for it.</p> <p>And then we went to a big demonstration in Birmingham. I think it was one of the highest turnouts at a Britain First rally. Everybody got drunk in the morning, it was absolute chaos. People were fighting with the police, trying to get through to an anti-fascist counterdemonstration across the road. I was controlling the Facebook camera feed and I said in the commentary: “The police are attacking us” – and that wasn’t true. I remember thinking afterwards: that’s wrong. What I did was pure propaganda, it was nowhere near the truth.</p> <p>It didn’t really feel the same after that. I quit and it felt like I’d lost a family member. I went back online and started looking for another group to join. I attended a few meetings – For Britain and Generation Identity – but I eventually said “no thanks”.</p> <p>Since then I’ve struggled a lot. During lockdown I was working from home and I had a really bad episode where I was self-harming. I was working in a call centre and if customers gave me abuse, I’d be openly crying on the phone. And then my parents got me counselling. So I started talking openly about being bullied in school and being in the far right, and that’s when the penny dropped. I’d been misled.</p> <p>Since then I’ve had my whole outlook on life turned. I’m a socialist now. I went from screaming at Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott to being their supporters. I’ve got a proper, secure job and I’m just about to move into a new place. I’m hoping eventually to become a Labour councillor. My parents were always Labour.</p> <p>It feels like an alternative life that I’ve lived, like I’m looking over into a parallel universe. I felt shame at first. I regret hurting the people I hurt, but I’ve got a new lease of life. I just want to use my story, so if any kids in school are going down the wrong path, I want to convince them to get off that path.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think parents need to watch what their kids are doing online.

Looking back on it, I think it would have been fairly obvious that I was in a dark place. They need to be looking out for pupils who are becoming reclusive, not talking to anyone.</p> <p>I have been threatened after leaving the far right. But at the end of the day somebody needs to come out and say these things. If I didn’t say anything and I could see the far right flourishing and going from strength to strength, I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself. We need to stand up to these people.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/03/revealed-uk-children-ensnared-far-right-ecosystem-online","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:00:28Z","webTitle":"Revealed: UK children being ensnared by ‘far-right ecosystem’ online","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/revealed-uk-children-ensnared-far-right-ecosystem-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/03/revealed-uk-children-ensnared-far-right-ecosystem-online","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: UK children being ensnared by ‘far-right ecosystem’ online","trailText":"Age profile of far-right referrals and arrests is getting younger, experts warn, though numbers remain small","byline":"Richard Adams and Sally Weale","body":"<p>An insidious “far-right ecosystem” is targeting children in an attempt to radicalise them online, with experts warning that progressively younger school pupils are becoming ensnared in extremist ideologies, a Guardian investigation has found.</p> <p>Teachers, police officers, academics and community leaders said there was evidence that long periods of unsupervised online access, compounded during Covid lockdowns, were resulting in children and young people across the UK encountering far-right groups in greater numbers than before.</p> <p>Gaming forums, private chatrooms and slickly produced online leaflets or “study guides” are among the platforms and tactics used to introduce young teenagers to racist, white supremacist, neo-Nazi and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/17/incel-movement-extremism-internet-community-misogyny\">involuntary celibate (“incel”)</a> ideas.</p> <p>“We are detecting cases of very young people ending up on the very far end of the extremist spectrum where they have planned or have even carried out attacks,” warned Julia Ebner, a senior fellow of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD).</p> <p>Det Supt Vicky Washington, who retired recently as national coordinator for the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/prevent-strategy\">Prevent counter-terrorism programme</a>, said social and physical isolation during the pandemic had created a perfect storm for far-right radicalisation.</p> <p>“There’s no one path, there’s no one sort of child who’s particularly vulnerable but I would say online, in a variety of ways, it’s something we are seeing more and more of,” Washington said.</p> <p>Experts are alarmed that while the absolute number is very small, the age profile of those referred and arrested in connection with far-right extremism is getting progressively younger. There have been convictions for children as young as 13 – and in one case concerns about a nine-year-old becoming involved in extremism. </p> <p>In January, a schoolboy from Darlington became the UK’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/19/14-year-old-boy-one-of-youngest-in-uk-to-be-convicted-of-terror-charges\">youngest person to be convicted of terrorism offences</a>. He was 13 when arrested as part of an investigation into rightwing terrorism and was charged with possessing information useful to a terrorist, namely manuals for making explosives. Before that conviction, the youngest UK terror offender was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/08/britains-youngest-convicted-terrorist-avoids-jail\">16-year-old from Cornwall</a> who downloaded terrorist manuals, also when aged 13.</p> <p>According to Home Office figures, terrorism-related arrests for all ideologies have risen, with the largest increase in the under-18 age group, up from 21 to 29, the highest number since records began in 2001. Under-18s now make up 15% of all terrorism-related arrests.</p> <p>Last year, Prevent adopted record levels of children and young people into its Channel anti-radicalisation programme for rightwing extremism, despite a huge fall in referrals during the pandemic. While the number of referrals dropped by a third, the number of under-15s adopted at Channel – the youngest group – was unchanged at 70.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/study-guides-trolling-raids-how-uk-far-right-groups-target-children-online\">From ‘study guides’ to trolling raids: how UK far-right groups target children online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The concerns come as counter-terrorism officials brace for the publication of a review of the government’s Prevent anti-radicalisation strategy by Sir William Shawcross.

We saw a large increase in our work over the last year.”</p> <p>Although the numbers of young people radicalised by the far right remained small, Wilkinson warned: “I was on duty outside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/gallery/2009/oct/13/brighton-bomb-margaret-thatcher\">Grand hotel [in Brighton] on 12 October 1984, when the IRA bomb went off</a>.

Matt Jukes, Britain’s most senior counterterror officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/17/far-right-mimicking-video-games-to-lure-middle-class-children-to-terrorism\">said 19 out of 20 children</a> aged under 18 who were arrested last year for terrorism offences were linked to an extreme rightwing ideology.</p> <p>Exit Hate, a national charity that supports families affected by far-right extremism, said it was asked to help a nine-year-old boy who was thought to have been recruited by his older brother. Parents were often unaware, or in some cases unconcerned, with many dismissing it as “just online, it’s not real”, said Wilkinson. </p> <p>In one case, a boy aged 15 from Bootle <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-61247774\">became radicalised after being befriended by far-right extremists</a> in virtual hangouts connected to the online game Fortnite. He made connections with online personalities, described in court as “professional trolls”, who invited him into private online forums, giving rise to what the judge called “some of the most appalling behaviour by a young person I have seen”.

Now they have the potential to turn very nasty indeed – with significant consequences for the global economy.</p> <p>At the moment, things look containable. Financial markets have responded relatively calmly to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-speaker-pledges-us-solidarity-tsai-in-wen-china-military-drills\">Nancy Pelosi’s visit</a> and the military exercises that Beijing has ordered in response. The assumption is that China will put on a show of strength and leave it at that.</p> <p>However, its president, Xi Jinping, also has economic and financial weapons at his disposal and may choose to use them. At the milder end of the spectrum, China could make it more difficult for US companies to access its market. It will be in no hurry, for example, to allow Boeing to resume sales of its 737 Max planes.</p> <p>This would accelerate the decoupling of the world’s two biggest economies – a trend that began when Donald Trump was in the White House and has continued under Joe Biden. Hostility towards Beijing is one of the few things Republicans and Democrats agree on.</p> <p>There is the risk, though, that China could go further and exploit Taiwan’s dependence on imported fuel by imposing a blockade on the island. As Mark Williams, the chief Asia analyst for Capital Economics, notes, this would soon cripple Taiwan’s industry and cause “huge global economic disruption”.</p> <p>That is because the island manufactures roughly half the world’s semiconductors, used in everything from mobile phones to cars and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/21/global-shortage-in-computer-chips-reaches-crisis-point\"> already running short</a>. Restricting the export of chips would lead to supply bottlenecks, higher inflation and weaker growth. Inevitably, there would also be pressure on the US not only to impose economic sanctions and asset freezes but to intervene militarily as well.</p> <p>Financial markets are probably underestimating the risks posed by Taiwan. At the very least, business confidence is going to take a fresh hit. The chances of tit-for-tat trade restrictions have increased. There will be more pressure for national self-sufficiency to reduce dependency on global supply chains.</p> <p>And that’s a relatively optimistic reading of events. There is clearly a risk – low but non-negligible – of this increasingly tense cold war turning hot.</p> <h2>Oil prices appear to have further to fall</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e896740e709aa12ebc217b2b81e5ad015bd61415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e896740e709aa12ebc217b2b81e5ad015bd61415/12_0_3488_2093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 3D-printed oil pump jack in front of the Opeclogo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opec no longer wields the influence over global energy markets it had in the 70s and 80s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a time when meetings of the oil cartel Opec were front-page news. When Sheikh Ahmed Yamani died last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/01/sheikh-ahmed-zaki-yamani-obituary\">the obituaries </a>made much of how, as Saudi Arabia’s petroleum minister, he was a pivotal figure in determining the global price of crude.</p> <p>But that was all a long time ago. Opec is now Opec+ thanks to the addition of some new members, including Russia, but it no longer wields the influence over global energy markets it had in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>Oil prices are now well down on the levels they reached in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and will probably fall further in the coming months. That has nothing to do with Wednesday’s meaningless decision by Opec+ to increase the supply of crude by 100,000 barrels a day and everything to do with global demand.</p> <p>As the International Monetary Fund noted last week, all three of the world’s major economies – the US, the eurozone and China – are stalling. Oil is trading at about $100 a barrel – a price consistent with strong global growth rather than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/17/fight-against-inflation-raises-spectre-of-global-recession\">the recession that is looming this winter</a>.</p> <p>Whether or not Opec+ adds to the downward pressure by increasing production, oil prices look to have further to fall.

Thinktanks are there to come up with radical new proposals. Politicians, though, have to separate the good ideas from the duff ones, and regional pay for public sector workers falls squarely into the latter category.</p> <p>There are reasons for that. One is that cutting public sector pay would reduce spending power in parts of the country that suffer from low levels of demand. Another is the need to provide incentives for the brightest and the best to take up jobs outside London and the south-east. The proposal is bad economics and bad politics, which jars with the government’s levelling up agenda.

Protagonist(s) Jan Dolski is the sole survivor of a crash-landed mining mission, trapped on an airless planet in a mobile base that resembles an East End boxpark strung to the inside of the London Eye. To run the facility, Dolski must spawn and collaborate with alternate versions of himself. These aren’t just doppelgangers, but independent characters with diverging personalities and skills (and haircuts) born of different life choices: one is a dreamy guitar player, another seems to have anger issues, a third is the boffin type, a fourth carries himself like Captain Kirk.</p> <p>Teamwork is crucial, but despite – or perhaps, thanks to – being genetically identical, Jan’s parallel selves may not get along. “[Their] paths branch at different stages or certain ages, defining their personality and – most importantly – identity,” says director Tomasz Kisilewicz. “The result is a different being that is annoyed by [different] things and driven by different motivations. Understanding them correctly is key to success in the game.” Mismanaging Dolski’s selves may lead to outright conflict; Kisilewicz declines to go into detail, but it’s certainly possible for them to die.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au_ek16Bm-o\"                                                                        > <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/au_ek16Bm-o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Based in Warsaw, 11 Bit has an unrivalled track record in games about small communities weathering uniquely awful circumstances. Its reputation-maker This War of Mine put you in charge of civilians during an urban siege. The Alters is much more of a comedy – its promotional artwork parodies The Last Supper, and features a sheep – but this is humour drenched in angst. “Who doesn’t from time to time bother themselves with wondering: what if?” Kisilewicz goes on. “We hope that the perturbations of the main character and his alterations will make players reflect on their own life paths and think of past situations that influenced them [where the] outcomes could have ended up being totally different.”</p> <p>The creation of Dolski’s alters is pure science-fiction – they come from a magic material called Rapidium – but the premise of “different personalities coming out of the same person” is familiar from <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/dissociation-and-dissociative-disorders/dissociative-disorders/\">real-world dissociative identity disorder</a>; “alter” is sometimes used to describe the identity states of a person with DID. “It is important that the alters not only share the same body but also a large part of their life paths, and thus their personality,” Kisilewicz comments. “So we looked at real-world multiple personality cases to best portray both the similarities and differences between them.”</p> <p>11 Bit runs the obvious risk of perpetuating misunderstandings of DID here. Besides individual case studies and documentaries about the condition, such as Busy Inside, the studio has drawn upon fictional portrayals such as M Night Shyamalan’s horror movie Split or the Toni Collette-helmed United States of Tara, both heavily criticised by clinicians and activists for replicating violent or “wacky” cliches. But then The Alters isn’t presenting itself as a straight representation of people with DID – rather, DID is “a point of reference” for a thought experiment in the spirit of Duncan Jones’s Moon. The developer has also looked at stories about identical twins, such as the documentary Three Identical Strangers, which follows the lives of triplets split up in mysterious circumstances after their birth.</p> <p>Assuming it can avoid the pitfall above, The Alters is shaping up to be an eerie and amusing tale of a latter-day Robinson Crusoe effectively weaponising his own midlife crisis. Has creating it prompted much reflection on the direction Kisilewicz’s own life could have taken? Definitely. “What would happen if I had never left my home town? That is the beauty of this whole concept. And when it comes to my own alternative personalities – hmmm. I think they could include a bitter architect, a small-town soccer dad, or an absolutely horrible singer.”</p> <ul> <li><p>The Alters will debut on PC; release date to be confirmed.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/03/kansas-abortion-rights-referendum-reaction","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T13:33:25Z","webTitle":"‘We could feel it’: Kansans celebrate upset abortion rights victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/kansas-abortion-rights-referendum-reaction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/kansas-abortion-rights-referendum-reaction","fields":{"headline":"‘We could feel it’: Kansans celebrate upset abortion rights victory","trailText":"Organizers said treating reproductive rights as a non-partisan issue was key to success in a Republican-leaning state","byline":"Poppy Noor in Kansas City","body":"<p>In a conference room at the Sheraton in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, people screamed, whooped, cheered and cried as a vote to protect abortion rights in Kansas’s state constitution came down late on Tuesday night.</p> \n<p>And it wasn’t just Democrats.</p> \n<p>James Quigley, 72, a retired doctor and a Republican from Johnson county, sat on his own drinking a glass of white wine after hearing the news. “Abortion is a much more nuanced issue than anti-choice individuals would have you think,” he told the Guardian. “It is deeply personal, sometimes tragic, but also sometimes a liberating decision – and we should trust women, their physicians, and their God on that,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We could feel it – we’ve been feeling it for weeks,” said Marcia Corbett, 71, a swing voter and local business owner, before the vote came in.</p> \n<p>The result had been eagerly awaited, as Kansas was the first state in the country to put abortion rights on the ballot since Roe v Wade, which federally guaranteed them, was overturned by the supreme court.

On Tuesday, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/02/kansas-abortion-texts/\">former Republican congressman</a> was linked to messages targeting voters with an anonymous, misleading text encouraging people to vote yes to protect abortion – when in fact a yes vote would have overturned a constitutional right to abortion.

Polling booths in Lawrence and Eudora saw a steady drip of voters, even in the middle of the day, with dozens of voters lining up to vote at any given time. Many were unaffiliated, but turned up just to vote in the referendum.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We’re a Republican state.

A veteran who had fought in Iraq, he said he was voting due to his own “personal circumstances” – his wife needed an abortion in a medical emergency during their marriage, in a pregnancy that would have otherwise taken her life. But he didn’t expect Kansas to side with him. “We’re a Republican state,” he said. “And we don’t generally vote that way.”</p> \n<p>But on a night of huge turnout, Kansas voted to protect abortion in the state’s constitution, with the no vote securing a whopping 59% to 41% of the anti-abortion movement.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of the night, the mood had been cautiously hopeful at the Kansas for Constitutional Freedom event in Overland Park, with the no vote ahead from the start. “We’re in the lead, and no is better than yes!” a young girl said to her mother, from next-door Missouri. The two had been canvassing together for weeks.</p> \n<p>The Democratic congresswoman Sharice Davids stood up to speak early in the night, telling the audience of about 100 people: “The [supreme court] decision definitely felt like a gut punch to a lot of people in our community … But we stood up and got to work.”</p> \n<p>Following speeches, all eyes in the room were on a television projection blaring MSNBC’s elections statistics guru Steve Kornacki, whose voice was barely audible over the sounds of people chattering, drinking and bursting into cheers whenever a county’s no vote was called.</p> \n<p>“Imagine how good we are going to feel when we beat the anti-abortion movement and the Republicans, who lied at every turn,” state congresswoman Stephanie Clayton said.</p> \n<p>“I feel really good right now,” said Leslie Butsch, who had tears in her eyes by 8.30pm. She was watching as the vote in Johnson county first showed signs of leaning heavily towards no, after weeks of spending her evenings knocking on doors there. An hour later, when the result came through, she was one of the few people without a celebratory drink in her hand – she’d just spent all her cash tipping the bar staff in a flurry of happiness.</p> \n<p>“I feel overwhelmed with gratitude. Today we learned that organizers are more powerful than ever. We did the impossible,” she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fce80d9d71931bfa16b5f5bfbb4cf6b16b9e440\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fce80d9d71931bfa16b5f5bfbb4cf6b16b9e440/115_0_3269_1963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voter mark their ballots during the primary election and abortion referendum at a Wyandotte county polling station in Kansas City, Kansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voter mark their ballots during the primary election and abortion referendum at a Wyandotte county polling station in Kansas City, Kansas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Cox/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>State senator Dinah Sykes burst into tears when the vote was called, covering her mouth and showing friends goosebumps on her arms. “It’s just amazing. It’s breathtaking that women’s voices were heard and [that] we care about women’s health,” she said.</p> \n<p>She knew that the vote would be close in a state that gave Trump a 15 percentage point lead over Biden in the 2020 election. “But we were close in a lot of rural areas and that really made the difference – I’m just so grateful,” she said.</p> \n<p>Ashley All, the spokesperson for KCF, said the success of their campaign was testament to non-partisanship – and other states should take heed. “It will be interesting for other states to watch this, and see this is not a partisan issue,” she said.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden made a statement on the result late on Tuesday. “Voters in Kansas turned out in record numbers to reject extreme efforts to amend the state constitution to take away a woman’s right to choose and open the door for a statewide ban,” the president said.</p> \n<p>“This vote makes clear what we know: the majority of Americans agree that women should have access to abortion and should have the right to make their own healthcare decisions.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the defeated anti-abortion group Kansans for Life sent out an email to supporters following the vote, sharing their dismay. For a movement that has been on the rise in America – since before Roe was overturned, and after – it was clear they had suffered a powerful blow.</p> \n<p>“The mainstream media propelled the left’s false narrative, contributing to the confusion that misled Kansans about the amendment,” it said, and vowed to fight on. “Our movement and campaign have proven our resolve and commitment. We will not abandon women and babies.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/03/rishi-sunak-prevent-strategy-conservative-leadership","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T13:29:19Z","webTitle":"Sunak wants to punish those who ‘vilify the UK’.

It’s true that a sizeable part of the terrorist threat we face comes from hateful criminals who align to the Islamic State death cult. However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/terrorism-in-the-uk-the-rising-threat-of-far-right-extremists\">in recent years it appears</a> that “the most severe threats to the country’s national security feature people planning atrocities linked to extreme rightwing ideology”. For example, Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Matt Jukes, head of counter-terrorism,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/terrorism-in-the-uk-the-rising-threat-of-far-right-extremists\"> said that</a> “19 out of 20 children who were arrested in the previous 12 months for terrorism offences were linked to an extreme rightwing ideology”. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, rightwing ideologues have attempted to play down this far-right extremist threat and gun for “Islamist extremism”: a label that is deployed indiscriminately by rightwing ideologues to smear mainstream Muslims who have no truck with terrorists, but don’t play by the right’s playbook.</p> <p>These ideologues have been bolstered by the comments of William Shawcross, who led the government’s review of Prevent, a man who in the past has voiced awful positions about Islam and Muslims.</p> <p>Rather than listen to the aforementioned criticisms of Prevent by internationally renowned figures, it appears that Sunak wants to fundamentally reorient Prevent away from the far right to focus more on “Islamist extremists”, parroting these rightwing ideologues, and acting as a loudspeaker for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/leaked-prevent-review-attacks-double-standards-on-rightwingers-and-islamists\">the leaked conclusions</a> of this very same Shawcross in his still unpublished review. </p> <p>This is all so disappointing. The campaign for leadership of the Conservative party presented a window of opportunity to turn a new page: to tackle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/may/25/tory-islamophobia-report-criticises-boris-johnson-over-burqa-remarks\">institutional Islamophobia</a> within its ranks – hitherto ignored – and instead <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flinkprotect.cudasvc.com%2Furl%3Fa%3Dhttps%253a%252f%252fwww.theguardian.com%252fcommentisfree%252f2022%252fjun%252f13%252fpatriotism-optimism-muslim-britain-islamophobia-discrimination%26c%3DE%2C1%2CpptKOr4x_1WW36vsRihluVyYd-yaKvw5jsomMv12PFfnx6ze51uylDnPBJjbkbU0Vu4mrzHg9Qf-YONHHe1Rk6YlQmvRiHuPzyx1XvpKM3AUYA%2C%2C%26typo%3D1&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Ca6f094977e2e4b0c5b7a08da752a6c11%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637951122304098239%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=FmBRFulMZ8VHPune0E3u%2B3mDci4F1CLgWGDA7lyoWOI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">tell the story</a> of patriotic, optimistic and confident Muslims.

His wife, Miriam González Durántez, a leading international trade lawyer, is Spanish.</p> <p>Clegg and González Durántez have not hidden their longing for home during their stay in California, where they moved with their three children after Mark Zuckerberg hired the former Liberal Democrat leader in 2018.</p> <p>Clegg, 55, said in an interview last year that his “heart belongs massively 5,000 miles away” while González Durántez posted on Instagram that she felt like “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRKHHspjHdC/?hl=en\">kissing the ground</a>” upon a pandemic-delayed return to Spain last year.</p> <p>That personal attachment played a role in the revelation on Wednesday that Clegg, Zuckerberg’s point person for dealing with government relations and policy around the world, will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/nick-clegg-returns-to-london-with-other-facebook-owner-execs-meta\">partly relocate to London this year</a>. It is understood that Clegg views London as a good base for dealing with issues in Europe and Asia, while the Financial Times, which first reported the story, said personal reasons were a key factor, including being close to his elderly parents.</p> <p>Clegg has previously expressed his desire to return to Europe, a continent he has described as “<a href=\"https://highprofiles.info/interview/nick-clegg/\">very much part of who I am</a>”. Asked by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/913c0cc2-9498-4d25-b2e8-794e24702e0b\">the FT last year</a> if he wanted to spend another five years in California, he said: “No, no …  I’m such a European at heart. I enjoy the work immensely – I’ve got absolutely no sell-by date about the work,” adding that his heart was in Europe.</p> <p>González Durántez, 54, has been more tongue-in-cheek about the limitations of life in California with Clegg and their three sons, via her Instagram account. Weeks after moving to the US, she posted a picture of the “British corner” of her local supermarket, showing a row of Heinz spaghetti tins with the comment “Brexiteers would be proud”. She also related her horror at encountering tinned tortillas: “There should be an international convention forbidding treating tortillas like this.”</p> <p>The lawyer, who currently leads the trade and EU regulation practice of the US firm Cohen &amp; Gresser, compared Silicon Valley to the Vatican in an <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/my-new-life-in-silicon-valley-miriam-gonzalez-durantez-on-moving-to-california-with-nick-clegg-bmfqbdbpg\">interview with the Times</a>. Living in the centre of the US tech industry, she said, was “a bit like living in the Vatican. It’s slightly insular, massively wealthy. It’s not so diversified and is mostly run by men. So very similar”.</p> <p>But there are also strong professional reasons for Clegg to spend more time in London. His job as president of global affairs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/nick-clegg-returns-to-london-with-other-facebook-owner-execs-meta\">to which he was promoted in February</a>, involves focusing on regulatory issues, which means a heavy emphasis on the UK and Europe.</p> <p>Internet regulation is being shaped by the online safety bill in the UK and, in the EU, by the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act. The online safety bill, which imposes a duty of care on tech firms to shield users from harmful content, could be reshaped by the new prime minister after its progress through parliament was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/14/ministers-hit-back-kemi-badenoch-online-safety-bill\">shunted into the autumn</a>.</p> <p>According to one regulatory expert, a move to the UK is the right thing to do in that context. William Perrin, a trustee at Carnegie UK, said: “The future of the dominant tech companies is being forged as much by regulation as by the market. Europe and the UK are shaping modern regulation. It makes sense for senior executives to be here.”</p> <p>So for Clegg’s decision, there is an element of head as well as heart.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/03/christina-aguilera-review-copper-bottomed-crowdpleasers-by-the-seaside","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T13:09:47Z","webTitle":"Christina Aguilera review – copper-bottomed crowdpleasers by the seaside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/03/christina-aguilera-review-copper-bottomed-crowdpleasers-by-the-seaside","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/03/christina-aguilera-review-copper-bottomed-crowdpleasers-by-the-seaside","fields":{"headline":"Christina Aguilera review – copper-bottomed crowdpleasers by the seaside","trailText":"It’s Aguilera turned up to 11: a rainbow of musical styles, confetti cannons, fireworks and dancers – plus one stage-invading seagull","byline":"Dave Simpson","body":"<p>After initially emerging in the late 90s as a bubblegum teenage pop star, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/christinaaguilera\">Christina Aguilera</a> took control of her career and embarked on a voyage of reinvention. Released in 2002, Stripped saw her ditch her all-American look to sing about sexual emancipation and empowerment. Two decades, many hairstyles, five Grammys and some 43m in record sales later, she is a 41-year-old mother of two and an <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/christina-aguilera-lgbtq-community-8070309/\">LGBTQ+ icon</a>. Her huge audience demographic includes face-painted teens, women from their 20s to their 40s, couples, tattooed blokes and – in this Yorkshire seaside town at least – curious low-flying seagulls, one of which invades the stage.</p> <p>The show itself is an 80-minute audiovisual extravaganza that takes in most of Aguilera’s complexities. The music spans a spectrum from bubblegum to Latin pop via soul and funk and elements of rock and hip-hop, while always sounding identifiably Aguilera. There are steam and confetti cannons, lasers, Star Wars-type lightsabers, fireworks, a mixed-gender dance troupe and a regular supply of costume changes. Meanwhile, Aguilera’s bewildering array of eyewear runs from reasonably conventional dark sunglasses to silver Cybertron shades and the sort of heavy-duty goggles more usually seen on industrial welders.</p> <p>“All right, Scarborough, how are you doin’?” she yells, as a raunchy, hip-hoppy Dirrty finds her pairing a silver bustier with trademark PVC chaps. Moments later, she yells: “This is for my girls around the world,” by way of introduction to Can’t Hold Us Down. Having rocketed from sex to feminist empowerment in the opening two numbers, Vanity combines both and thereafter she flits between moods and styles like she’s flicking pages in a book. Breakthrough smash Genie In a Bottle is the evening’s first big crowd sing-along. What a Girl Wants, also from 1999, starts as a sweet love song but turns into an extended thank you to her audience for “sticking with me all these years and giving me everything I wanted”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ae149e42716f713216ba42b8de59a8ac0098da6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae149e42716f713216ba42b8de59a8ac0098da6c/0_227_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christina Aguilera in Scarborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extravaganza … Christina Aguilera in Scarborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Dobson/Alamy Live News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She reappears in red for a trio of songs – Euro banger Santo, the more yearning Suéltame and an acoustic guitar-led Pa Mis Muchachas – from this year’s Aguilera, her second Spanish-language album, and explains that the pandemic allowed her to “take a pause and get back to what I wanted to do, and my Latino side”. She reveals that early in her career she faced pressure to change her surname, but steadfastly refused because “it’s what I stand for and the music is what I feel authentically and wholeheartedly.” Then she shape-shifts again for Feel This Moment – a 2013 hit with rapper Pitbull which interpolates A-ha’s Take on Me and Maroon 5’s smash Moves Like Jagger, a song on which she originally appeared. Such copper-bottomed crowdpleasers buy her the space for a more intimate monologue about “how crazy the world is now” and “the importance of hope and knowing it will be OK”. This introduces another global smash, Say Something. Originally a duet with writers A Great Big World, here she delivers it as a tender duet with singer Nelson and a spontaneous crowd choir.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/06/linda-perry-non-blonde-pink-christina-aguilera-dolly-parton-gwen-stefani-courtney-love\">Legendary hit-maker Linda Perry: ‘Singers have to earn my songs. I don’t just give them out’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By now, Aguilera is in her element, grinning from ear to ear during a burlesque section and playfully wielding a whip for Labelle’s disco hit, Lady Marmalade. So much so that she misses her cue at the start of Beautiful. “I was chatting so much to you guys. This has never happened before!” she explains. The big, Beatlesque power ballad about self-esteem shows off her four-octave vocal range to dazzling effect.</p> <p>There’s an appropriately harder edge to Fighter, a song which effectively explains how her strength and resilience derive from her troubled childhood and experiences of witnessing domestic violence in the home. Conversely, she introduces set closer Let There Be Love by explaining that she wants to leave us “with a message – to love yourself”. Like most things she says here it could sound like a platitude, but behind the party atmosphere and ticker tape finale this multi-faceted show feels personal, heartfelt and sincere.</p> <p><em>• At M&amp;S Bank Arena, Liverpool, 3 August, and the 02 Arena, London, 5 August.

There is again uplifting talk of a legacy, a cultural shift and positive social change that can come from this. But we need to admit that we have had nights like this and talked like this before. Super Saturday at London 2012 springs to mind.</p> \n<p>There was lofty talk of legacies and inspiring a nation then, too.

We have become good at delivering the latter but have yet to deliver the former. Recent reviews of London 2012 10 years on have reminded us of the promises made but not kept.</p> \n<p>Reviews highlight is the loose planning at government level around boosting participation, the lack of understanding of what’s required on the ground which is so different from what’s required to succeed at elite level, and the political and social commitment to focus on building the grassroots when it’s not fashionable or in the latest headlines.</p> \n<p>While it can seem masterminding a tournament victory is nigh on impossible – after all, it’s taken England since 1966 to achieve it in football – it’s actually even harder to mastermind reaping the benefits of sport for all across a nation. The real challenge goes way beyond identifying the next generation of Lionesses. It’s about how to ensure we reach the millions of girls and women who weren’t watching on Sunday evening but deserve access to the benefits of a healthy, active life.</p> \n<p>Throughout my life, no government has realised the potential of sport to improve the nation’s health and education. When looking back on the legacy of London 2012, Blair admitted that despite his commitment and that of his inspirational colleague Dame Tessa Jowell, there wasn’t a full plan to deliver the national benefits properly. Nor has any government since managed to do this – yet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"61e42ecb-32e7-43e0-9e71-3148e934fe86\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8cspgW4SmZo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Government and non-government organisations are good at delivering in silos – sport within education is part of the department of education remit, sport’s health benefits are covered by the department of health, sport’s potential to be part of increasing life opportunities and social mobility sits within the levelling up department, and sport itself sits within the curious mix of the department for culture, media and sport.</p> \n<p>Sport has no cabinet position in its own right, and government quangos Sport England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and UK Sport hold key remits. For sport to be successful, it requires an unprecedented level of cross‑government cooperation and collaboration, breaking down the hardened traditional Whitehall silos.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that this time football is in a better place, with experienced and accomplished sports leaders at the helm with the wisdom from past mistakes to start putting in place plans for grassroots participation. Baroness Sue Campbell has been the mastermind behind women’s football at the Football Association and needed all her incredible strength, wit and belief to create a vision and force others to back it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/how-womens-football-can-capitalise-on-england-triumph-euro-2022\">How women’s football can capitalise on England triumph – in six steps</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Campbell’s brilliant successor as chief executive at the Youth Sport Trust (Campbell was both chief executive and chair), Ali Oliver, has been part of the long-term plan to ensure girls’ football is on the curriculum at school. And Tim Hollingsworth, who worked with Campbell when she was transforming Olympic and Paralympic sport at UK Sport, is chief executive at Sport England, which holds arguably the most important responsibility in sport to increase activity levels across the nation and develop sustainable community sport.</p> \n<p>But even with these brilliant leaders, there are many others in the ecosystem needed to play their part and create significant change. At grassroots level, local clubs, community sports organisations and schools where football has traditionally been run by men need to go beyond simply offering a girls’ section. They need to ensure that those girls feel welcome, that there is space for everyone whatever their background, that they can play and enjoy the game, and that there are women coaches and volunteers and committee members.</p> \n<p>These are the things we should be tracking and measuring and caring about, rather than letting our gaze swing safely back to looking at the latest Premier League transfers and the world rankings of the national teams.</p> \n<p>Let’s not think there is purely a gender inequality to address. Access to and opportunities to play sport are a problem across multiple disadvantaged communities in the UK. And before we get too carried away with the beautiful game, this is wider than just football. Girls and women around the country deserve the opportunity to play rugby, take up triathlons or play golf.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"79769aef-aac7-4720-9876-c6af07ba13ef\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UyxADcvhdBI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In my own sport of rowing we are opening the doors of our wonderful sport wider with a recently established national foundation, Love Rowing, and brilliant regional initiatives from London’s Youth Rowing to Warrington Youth Rowing, but there is much more to do. Participation figures for people with disabilities remain unacceptably low, to the huge mental and physical detriment of a significant but marginalised part of society.</p> \n<p>So by all means, let’s be emboldened by Sunday evening’s triumph. Let’s take our ambitions beyond anything we have achieved before, because we know the impossible is now possible. Let’s start following what a legacy really looks like week in week out, with as much rigour as we track the latest league results and world rankings.

When rumours began to circulate that something was going to happen in Bosnia, no one could believe it. The country seemed integrated: a war would mean people literally fighting their neighbours.</p> <p>Many of us covering the siege of Sarajevo initially believed, perhaps naively, that telling the story loud enough, well enough and honestly enough would lead to condemnation and intervention from the international community. There was a sense of incredulity that this could be happening in a European capital city. I don’t think any of us would have thought the blockade would still be in place three years later.</p> <p>During those years, I made about 10 visits. In my first couple of weeks, I concentrated on the siege itself: casualties, patients in hospital, bodies in the morgue. Later, I became preoccupied with what happens to ordinary, educated, cultured people when they’re reduced to the medieval conditions caused by a siege.</p> <p>Sarajevans had little in the way of weapons, while food, water and electricity were often in short supply, but they were incredibly adaptable and tried to live as normally as they could. They would not give up things they wanted to do, such as meeting friends in the city centre. One of my photographs, taken a year in, shows a woman’s feet under a shroud in the morgue.

But the river, like much of the city, was visible to Serb snipers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A vibrant and important cultural life began to emerge – and that was my focus. I became friends with actors and artists, including a painter who alternated between working in his studio and fighting on the frontline. He even made a sketch, a plan for a network of trenches, in the shape of Piet Mondrian’s <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/78682\">Broadway Boogie Woogie</a>. Art and culture were seen as central to the defence of Sarajevo. It wasn’t just the physical city that was being defended, it was the concept of the city – what it is to be a citizen and part of society.</p> <p>People would risk their lives for a little pleasure. And it could be very hard on kids, who obviously didn’t want to be stuck indoors. During quieter periods, they were able to go outside more – I took a picture of children swimming in the river during a ceasefire. But the river, like so much of the city, was clearly visible to Serbian snipers. One winter, I attended an awful scene: a group of five or six children had been killed by a shell while sledging in front of their house.</p> <p>This picture of a child with a ball was taken while I was out walking in the beautiful late afternoon winter light. I just happened upon the scene, capturing the ball being thrown up in the air as if this was any street in the world. It’s such an ordinary thing for a kid to do, but it’s happening against the backdrop of the tank trap, a hint of the ever-present danger.</p> <p>Today, I split my time between the UK and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2015/dec/14/sarajevo-portrait-city-20-years-bosnian-war-dayton\">Sarajevo</a>. My wife is from the city and I have friends here. I recently held an exhibition in the rebuilt Vijećnica, the Sarajevo town hall that was razed in 1992. One photograph showed a string quartet playing in its ruins during the siege. I hung the image where it was taken, with the building restored to its former glory.</p> <p>• Paul Lowe’s books include Photography Masterclass; Understanding Photojournalism, with Dr Jenny Good; and Reporting the Siege of Sarajevo, with Kenneth Morrison.</p> <h2>Paul Lowe’s CV</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f9e0fafe5ba497614c1259af00d442dc7d921cb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9e0fafe5ba497614c1259af00d442dc7d921cb5/1651_0_4954_6192/800.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Lowe.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Lowe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin McKie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Born: </strong>London, 1963.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> BA in history, Cambridge University.

His investigation into the crimes against humanity in the Congo Free State (the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1903 began the process of Leopold II of Belgium surrendering his empire.
