Kiptanui, whose personal best of 2hr 5min 47sec would have made him the third fastest man in the field, was ready to run but by the time the mistake was discovered it was too late to change the paperwork. He ended up watching the race from the other side of the barriers. </p> <p>The race was eventually won by Uganda’s <strong>Victor Kiplangat</strong> in 2hr 10min 55sec, despite the fact he took a wrong turn while trying to navigate his way around a bus lane and had to double back on himself for 30m. He was still a minute-and-a-half ahead of Alphonce Simbu from Tanzania, who won silver. Kiptanui’s Kenyan teammate Michael Githae was third. </p> <p> There was more Kenyan confusion in the women’s race, where <strong>Margaret Muriuki</strong> ended up competing on her own even though her teammates Stella Barsosio and Purity Changwony had been picked to run with her. The race was won Australia’s <strong>Jessica Stenson</strong> with Muriuki third behind Namibia’s Helalia Johannes.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-30T16:24:28.145Z\">at 5.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62e556978f08af33ff4a4209\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-30T16:11:07.780Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Thanks, David.

Weir finished the race with a flat tyre, coming in seventh, a little over two minutes behind the winner. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce6864e3e6fea21f92fd3e0721faee7b9e66376f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6864e3e6fea21f92fd3e0721faee7b9e66376f/0_0_5251_3500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commonwealth Games 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JohnBoy Smith of England (left) celebrates after winning Gold in the Men’s T53/54 marathon with Bronze medalist Simon Lawson (centre) and silver medallist Sean Frame of Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/30/overhaul-campaign-before-its-too-late-sunak-told","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T21:13:36Z","webTitle":"Overhaul campaign before it’s too late, Rishi Sunak told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/overhaul-campaign-before-its-too-late-sunak-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/30/overhaul-campaign-before-its-too-late-sunak-told","fields":{"headline":"Overhaul campaign before it’s too late, Rishi Sunak told","trailText":"His team told his general election style campaign too slick and unfocused as time runs out to sway electors","byline":"Michael Savage Policy Editor","body":"<p>Rishi Sunak’s team is being urged to overhaul his “general election-style” campaign in favour of a grassroots effort speaking directly to Tory members in a last-ditch attempt to beat Liz Truss to the Conservative leadership.</p> <p>With some supporters of the former chancellor in despair over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/rishi-sunak-admits-it-was-silly-to-say-he-had-no-working-class-friends\" title=\"\">apparent grip Truss has assumed</a> over the contest to replace Boris Johnson, allies have warned that there has been too much focus on polished social media content, TV appearances and visits to swing voters that have not won over Tory members.</p> <p>Many Conservative MPs believe there is now only a brief window to change the race, with ballot papers delivered to members from Monday. Some prominent backers want Sunak and a large network of supportive MPs to dedicate their time solely to contacting local members directly through phone banks and online group calls to make his case.</p> <p>Truss attempted to play down suggestions that she was on course for a clear victory on Saturday, stating that the race to become prime minister “is not finished”. Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/rishi-sunak-admits-it-was-silly-to-say-he-had-no-working-class-friends\" title=\"\">endorsements from prominent Tories</a> in the past week, she said it “would be extremely premature” to start thinking about who would have a place in her cabinet. She added: “This is a very, very close race, and I am fighting for every vote.”</p> <p>Several MPs said that many local members had been relatively easy to persuade to back Sunak over Truss once they had been contacted, arguing that support for the foreign secretary was often soft. However, they said that the “air war” aspects of Sunak’s campaign were simply not reaching the membership, thought to comprise around 160,000 people.</p> <p>“They’re running it like an election campaign,” said one Sunak backer. “This is very straightforward. There’s 160,000 Tory members dotted around the country. We know who they are. We know where they are. All we have to do is talk to them. The social media campaign, the TV appearances – most of them make no difference to members.</p> <p>“The vote is very soft, you don’t have to do much to move it. We’re making this far too complicated. There’s brilliant people in charge, but I’m just worried we’re fighting the wrong campaign.”</p> <p>Another MP said: “The stuff they have their guys producing is social media stuff for a general election. This is about party members. It should just be about getting Rishi and key supporters to as many members as possible. They are trying to get MPs out for them, but it’s mainly producing social media graphics.”</p> <p>A third ally said: “I do think it’s looking quite difficult for him but I can’t give up hope yet. There are a lot of MPs talking to their associations. There’s still time. It would be preposterous to just go through the motions for the next four weeks.”</p> <p>Campaign sources said last night that Sunak was already heavily engaged in talking directly with members, including via online calls and local events. They said that regional campaign coordinators had been working with supportive MPs from the start to reach members. He was also photographed meeting groups of members yesterday.</p> <p>“The more people see Rishi, the more they like him, so our strategy is getting him in front of as many members as possible,” said a campaign source. “We are undeniably the underdog, but last time I checked Brits quite like the plucky underdog coming through. Members don’t like being told what to think by the media, so Team Truss shouldn’t count their chickens just yet.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20a48845f874a68dbb223f4f888817c12a3fd3b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20a48845f874a68dbb223f4f888817c12a3fd3b0/0_149_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss yesterday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss yesterday; a series of prominent Tories have swung behind her in the past few days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His team described yesterday as “super Saturday”, targeting local Tory associations in key southern constituencies with large memberships. They are also areas where members are more likely to have been upset by the chaotic nature of Johnson’s premiership.</p> <p>There continue to be concerns over how the party will come back together after a bitter campaign. Amanda Milling, the foreign office minister and former party chair, is pressing the candidates to sign up to a “clean campaign” pledge to limit the damage. “This leadership race has been the most toxic I have ever seen,” she said.</p> <p>“For the remainder of the race, I call on the teams to stop the blue on blue and focus on a clean, fair and policy-focused campaign. If we don’t, we make the task of reuniting the party harder and risk seeing us out of power for a decade.”</p> <p>Polls of Tory members have suggested Truss has a healthy double-digit lead over Sunak, but the former chancellor’s cheerleaders say the battle is not over. “The sense is that the vote for Truss is still soft, and so we shouldn’t assume anything about the members just yet,” said an insider.</p> <p>To make an impression on the race, Sunak announced last night plans to charge patients £10 for a missed medical appointment to help clear the Covid backlog. He said he would revive high streets, slash the number of empty shops and backed tougher punishment for graffiti and littering, as well as additional powers for police to tackle anti-social behaviour.</p> <p>“I understand the vital role that high streets play in local communities. I don’t just want them to survive; I want them to thrive,” he said. “We should all take pride in our high streets so I will also crack down on anti-social behaviour, graffiti and littering – through extended police powers and increased fines. I have been clear that I have a plan to rebuild our economy; our high streets are a crucial part of that.”</p> <p>In an earlier intervention Sunak vowed to tackle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-culture-war-woke-nonsense\" title=\"\">what he described as “woke nonsense”</a>. While claiming he had no interest in fighting a “culture war”, he said he wanted to “end the brainwashing, the vandalism and the finger pointing”. It led to accusations that he was trying to outflank Truss on the right.</p> <p>The pleas for a campaign overhaul are a sign of frustration and anxiety among Sunak supporters. As Sunak trails Truss in the polls, a series of prominent Tories have swung behind the foreign secretary in the past few days as she has consolidated her status as frontrunner.</p> <p>Tom Tugendhat, who had emerged as the preferred leadership candidate of the centrist one-nation wing of the party, is the most recent major figure to endorse Truss. He said that her plan for immediate tax cuts was “founded on true Conservative principles”.</p> <p>His support followed endorsements from Jake Berry, the influential leader of the Northern Research Group of MPs, and defence secretary Ben Wallace, a favourite among Tory members.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/30/alice-kinsella-leads-england-to-team-into-regaining-gymnastics-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T21:06:09Z","webTitle":"Alice Kinsella leads England team as they regain gymnastics gold in style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/alice-kinsella-leads-england-to-team-into-regaining-gymnastics-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/30/alice-kinsella-leads-england-to-team-into-regaining-gymnastics-gold","fields":{"headline":"Alice Kinsella leads England team as they regain gymnastics gold in style","trailText":"A promising England team led by Alice Kinsella picked up gold in the women’s team gymnastics at Arena Birmingham","byline":"Tumaini Carayol at Arena Birmingham","body":"<p>As Great Britain’s women’s gymnastics team look to push on and continue their progress following the surprise Olympic team bronze medal last year in Tokyo, England gave an encouraging demonstration of their depth as they dominated the Commonwealth Games to win gold in the team final on Saturday night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2022/jul/30/commonwealth-games-2022-day-two-in-pictures\">Commonwealth Games 2022: day two in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England had won the women’s team title in 2010 and 2014 before they were usurped by a strong Canadian team on the Gold Coast.

Something of a veteran even at 21 years old and the backbone of the team, Kinsella demonstrated her growing consistency by qualifying first on balance beam, where she won a gold in 2018, with a score of 13.45.

The firework smoke had not even cleared when Katherine Brunt, who had been presented with a ceremonial cap before the start of play to mark the start of her 100th international T20 match, dismissed Vishmi Gunaratne lbw with the very first delivery. For a minute Brunt seemed to be the only person in Edgbaston who had realised what had happened, and her appeal echoed out loudly around the stunned ground. And then the umpire’s finger went up and everyone else joined in with her.</p> \n<p>The place was about a third full, which was a fair turnout by the standards of some of the events at the Games, but considerably less than the organisers had promised were going to attend. England’s games were supposed to be all sold out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/england-begin-commonwealth-games-cricket-without-captain-heather-knight\">England begin Commonwealth Games cricket without captain Heather Knight</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, they were a loud, happy, enthusiastic crowd. And it was at least a better turnout than the last time the sport was included in the Commonwealths. When the men played a 50-over tournament at Kuala Lumpur in 1998 the England team did not bother to show up because it clashed with the County Championship, which gives an idea of how priorities have shifted in the last 24 years.</p> \n<p>Back then, the authorities were not sure they needed the Commonwealth Games. This time, their participation is a crucial part of the sport’s bid to prove it should be included in the Olympics. Cricket has been left off from the provisional list of sports for Los Angeles 2028, but there is a chance it may yet be included when the organisers make the final decision later next year. The ICC has reportedly spent $3m on lobbying to try to persuade them to do it, too. Whether it is a success or not will likely depend on whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India buy into the idea enough to sell it on to the International Olympic Committee.</p> \n<p>But England did their part by playing well here. Too well, in fact, in that they made a mismatch of it. Brunt’s first two overs cost only five runs, and since Sophie Ecclestone dismissed Hasini Perera caught and bowled in her very first over, Sri Lanka were 35 for two at the end of the powerplay.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4f5d1f3870e2b660f8934b62c5b99750651643b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4f5d1f3870e2b660f8934b62c5b99750651643b/0_199_4435_2660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Brunt leaps in the air after taking Vishmi Gunaratne’s wicket with the first ball of the match\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Brunt leaps in the air after taking Vishmi Gunaratne’s wicket with the first ball of the match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Their best batter, Chamari Athapaththu, was still in though, so there was some hope. Until the 17-year-old Freya Kemp came on and bowled her with her first delivery, a superb off-cutter that went past Athapaththu’s outside edge and flush into her off stump.</p> \n<p>The innings dribbled out after that. Between Brunt, Ecclestone, Kemp, Sarah Glenn and Issy Wong, England’s bowling was altogether too much for a flailing Sri Lankan batting lineup, who struggled to cobble together a hundred runs between them. Nat Sciver, standing in as captain while Heather Knight recovers from a hip injury, had a Swiss Army knife of an attack to work with: right and left arm fast, leg-spin, off-spin, slow-left-arm and her own medium pace. They could go a long way in this tournament before they come across a problem they don’t have a solution for somewhere in there.</p> \n<p>Here, it was Wong and Kemp who tore out the middle order, then Ecclestone, who took two of her three in the final over, mopping up the tail. The chase wasn’t entirely straightforward, the pitch was a little too tricky for that. England lost both openers in the powerplay, Danni Wyatt caught at mid-off before she could really get started, and Sophia Dunkley, bowled by a slower ball, soon after she had.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2eafeaf5-fb23-4b45-a4e7-496afe5098b1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>One of the leading contenders for the men’s marathon at the Commonwealth Games was forced to watch the event from the sidelines after Kenyan officials apparently entered the wrong Eric for the event.</p>\n    <p>Eric Kiptanui, who has named in the Kenyan squad in May, was supposed to compete but when he arrived at the start line he found that somehow a 21-year-old runner called <b>Eric Kiplagat Sang</b> had being entered instead.

Capsey eventually got herself stumped for 44 trying to hit the winning runs, which Bouchier duly did by creaming a four down the ground.</p> \n<p>The way she did it suggested England have more in them. They will need it, too. Earlier in the day, New Zealand beat South Africa by 13 runs in the first game in Group B, thanks to a brilliant 91 not out off 64 balls by Suzie Bates and the all-round efforts of their captain, Sophie Devine, who scored 48 and then took three for 37 as South Africa were bowled out for 154. England play South Africa next, on Tuesday, and New Zealand two days after that, so it feels as though it is uphill all the way to the semi-finals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the meantime, everyone’s attention will be on India’s match against Pakistan on Sunday.

We recognise there is a place during a pandemic for extra support but we don’t believe that additional conditions for casuals will be required,” he says.</p> \n<p>“The Victorian chamber would strongly oppose any levy, should the government consider extending beyond the two-year pilot.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There are other ways to prevent the spread of diseases at work, too. Prof Mike Toole, a Burnet Institute epidemiologist, says offering compensation for infectious diseases such as influenza to all casual workers could “open Pandora’s box”. He suggests, instead, a nationwide campaign to encourage workers to wear N95 masks at work to prevent influenza, common colds and Covid.</p> \n<p>“The message should be if you can, stay home, and if you do have to go to work, wear a mask. That’s what people in countries like Japan have been doing for decades,” he says.</p> \n<p>Delivering “secure, well-paid jobs” is one of the core objectives of the federal government’s <a href=\"https://treasury.gov.au/employment-whitepaper/jobs-summit\">jobs and skills summit scheduled for September</a>.</p> \n<p>Speaking on ABC’s Insiders last week, Burke declined to expand on the issue of more entitlements for casual workers, saying instead that job security should be an objective of the Fair Work Act, alongside flexibility.</p> \n<p><strong>“</strong>I’m much more interested in how we can promote secure work and get more people into secure jobs than just redefining everything about casual employment,” he said.</p> \n<p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions has long campaigned for sick leave for casual workers, but agrees tackling the cause of the problem – insecure work – is the priority.</p> \n<p>“Most so-called casual workers are working regular hours with the same employer, day in, day out. Nearly one million ‘casual’ workers are effectively working permanent full-time hours. These workers should have the right to be permanent with paid leave including sick leave provisions,” the ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, says.</p> \n<p>As Victoria inches towards a state election in November, the Victorian Trades Hall Council secretary, Luke Hilakari, has vowed to make the Coalition’s opposition to the scheme an election issue.</p> \n<p>Hilakari says the union body would like the trial’s scope to be expanded and for it to be permanent but otherwise the scheme is “great”.</p> \n<p>“You get to be sick and still be able to pay the bills, like every other worker,” he says.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/31/keep-pushing-boxer-tina-rahimi-went-from-casual-classes-to-commonwealth-games-in-five-years","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T20:00:35Z","webTitle":"‘Keep pushing’: boxer Tina Rahimi went from casual classes to Commonwealth Games in five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/keep-pushing-boxer-tina-rahimi-went-from-casual-classes-to-commonwealth-games-in-five-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/31/keep-pushing-boxer-tina-rahimi-went-from-casual-classes-to-commonwealth-games-in-five-years","fields":{"headline":"‘Keep pushing’: boxer Tina Rahimi went from casual classes to Commonwealth Games in five years","trailText":"Rahimi took up boxercise for fun.

Training tapers off before competition, but she has done two hours of sprints today already. In another two hours, there’s sparring.</p> <p>Sitting inside a bare, beige room, Rahimi is all smiles . There is little of the pugilist in her face <strong>–</strong> she could be mistaken for a YouTube makeup artist; perfect brows, long lashes and glossy manicured nails slide into view as she gesticulates – which is often. She speaks rapidly, and with warmth, frequently splicing sentences with a rhetorical “you know what I mean?”</p> <p>Before boxing, Rahimi had done the odd bit of school sports. If there was an athletics carnival, she’d have a go (“I wasn’t really great”) and for a couple of years in her early teens she played football. Her dad, who drove her to high school matches, had always been athletic – a champion wrestler in Australia and Europe in the 1980s and 1990s. Now, “he’s like: ‘You have my blood in you. Make me proud.’”</p> <p>When Rahimi’s placement on the team was announced, making her the first female Muslim boxer to represent Australia, media requests flooded in. It was overwhelming, she says. </p> <p>“I was like, ‘Oh wow. This is a lot.’ I just feel like I’m a normal person, you know what I mean?” </p> <p>“I know that because I look different and I dress differently, it’s going to get a bit more attention. I mean, that’s why it kind of blew up.”</p> <p>But she hopes her success can show others that how you look or dress doesn’t matter. “It all comes down to how hard you work, how disciplined you are, and how bad you want something.”</p> <p>And Rahimi wants it bad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a983e6daeb6441979cfdf3e7f264c0957da00779\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a983e6daeb6441979cfdf3e7f264c0957da00779/0_130_4750_2852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tina Rahimi at Brotherhood Boxn Gym in Sydney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tina Rahimi at Brotherhood Boxn Gym in Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Belfast, she was training three times a day, six days a week.

It’s the best punch you can throw, in her opinion. Her right cross is good too, “when it lands”. It is the discipline of perpetual improvement, of learning, she says, that first drew her to the sport and, while “it’s so hard”, it keeps her going too. Even in the moments she hates it, she says, afterwards she feels amazing. “I just feel like I’ve accomplished something.” </p> <p>“I just love it! I just love the feeling,” she says, searching through a smile for the words to explain. </p> <p>“It’s that I know that I can push myself more than you can push yourself. I won’t give up.

The pair analysed DNA evidence from hairs caught in a plaster cast made of the man’s face more than half a century ago by investigators.</p> <p>Abbott tells Guardian Australia how archival records shed light on the seemingly mysterious facts of the case, revealing them to be “a sort of banal explanation”.</p> <p>The records show Webb separated from his wife, Abbott says.</p> <p>“And in 1947 guess where she went? She went to South Australia. So you might think, ‘well, this guy is somebody who sort of seems to be a bit of a loner [from] Victoria. What’s he doing in South Australia?</p> <p>“It’s speculation, of course, but you know, you can join the dots and say, well, maybe he’s there to go and see her.”</p> <p>Details about Webb were provided when the couple filed for divorce.</p> <p>“One of the interesting details is that [Webb] was into writing his own poetry,” Abbott says, which connects to the evidence of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám.</p> <p>The other mystery that the divorce papers shed light on is the so-called “secret code” which was found scrawled inside the cover of the Rubáiyát with its last page missing. The book was handed to police by a man who said it had been thrown into his car around the time of the death.</p> <p>Abbott says “at Adelaide University we’ve been analysing those for years now and we’ve always come up with a conclusion that it’s not actually a code, it’s just the first letter of some words”.</p> <p>Abbott had joked several years ago they were the first letters of horse names, and the divorce papers reveal Webb was fond of horse racing and betting.</p> <p>Despite many believing Somerton man was a foreigner because no one came forward to identify the body, Abbott says the fact that Webb was from Victoria correlates with what police said at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82763544180d3130b7524a1646d4244daa864e56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82763544180d3130b7524a1646d4244daa864e56/0_0_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Abbott at West Terrace cemetery in Adelaide, 19 May, 2021\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Abbott at West Terrace cemetery in Adelaide, 19 May, 2021.

Keane”.</p> <p>Abbott says Webb had a brother-in-law called Thomas Keane who lived a 20-minute drive away from him in Melbourne.</p> <p>“It seems logical that he got his hand-me-downs from his brother-in-law,” Abbott says.</p> <p>“The most important thing” Abbott says, is that the DNA taken from the hair caught in the plaster cast of Somerton man matches with distant cousins of Carl “Charles” Webb on both maternal and paternal sides of the family.</p> <p>“It’s not just that it matched but it actually triangulated, so it connected to a cousin on the father’s side and a cousin on the mother’s side.”</p> <p>The process of DNA identification also ruled out that Abbott’s wife, Rachel Egan, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-15/a-marriage-and-a-mystery-somerton-man-romantic-twist/11377458\">who he met through his research</a> was related to Somerton man.</p> <p>Egan’s father was the Australian ballet dancer Robin Thomson, who was the son of the nurse whose phone number was in the Rubáiyát.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0232362daf92b8914bb4cd77fb9a97046de1d67f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0232362daf92b8914bb4cd77fb9a97046de1d67f/0_118_1802_1081/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Somerton man: so-called ‘secret code’ found scrawled inside the cover of the Rubáiyát.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The so-called ‘secret code’, which was found scrawled inside the cover of the Rubáiyát.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wikimedia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Egan told <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCK-Wp-Az8g\">ABC’s Australian Story</a> that members of her family raised concerns Abbott was only after her “for her DNA”.</p> <p>Abbott says “one of the first things we did was check her DNA on it.

For more than 20 years, he had been a credit manager at a large construction company. It was his responsibility to make sure people paid their accounts on time – not easy, but he was experienced and professional. Then he was unexpectedly made redundant.</p> <p>The redundancy came not long after a traumatic set of circumstances on the job, during which John started struggling with depression and anxiety. The payout was substantial – approximately $175,000 – but the sudden end to his career deeply affected his already declining mental health.</p> <p>“One night after taking antidepressants, sleeping tablets and having a few beers, I decided to jump online and thought I’d have a go at online gambling,” John says. “I lost the whole of my redundancy in two weeks.”</p> <p>Aghast, John quickly reached out to a gambling support organisation, and then the betting company. The company, a household name, agreed to refund his money, and John self-excluded from their service. But that didn’t prevent him from signing up with a second company.</p> <p>Two weeks later, he had lost it all again.</p> <p>“This time, when I approached [the company] to get the money back, they told me to go and get stuffed,” John says. “That’s when it hit home that all the money was gone.”</p> <h2>Hiding losses is ‘good for business’</h2> <p>More than 150 betting companies operate online in Australia. From Sunday, the federal government is ordering all of them to send monthly activity statements to anyone who has laid a bet. The exception is Tabcorp, which requested and was granted another three months to comply.</p> <p>The statements will clearly lay out how much money the account holder has spent, won and lost over the preceding six months, including an itemised transaction list.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-document\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123097-national-framework-activity-statement-prototype\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/22123097-national-framework-activity-statement-prototype/?embed=1\" title=\"National Framework - activity statement prototype (Hosted by DocumentCloud)\" width=\"700\" height=\"989\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\" ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Advocates for gambling reform have been pushing for the measure for years. It was one of the key minimum steps recommended by the 2018 <a href=\"https://www.dss.gov.au/communities-and-vulnerable-people-programs-services-gambling/national-consumer-protection-framework-for-online-wagering-national-policy-statement\">National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering in Australia</a>, developed by the previous Coalition government in conjunction with the states. The activity statements were supposed to be introduced within 18 monthsbut were left lagging, along with a number of other measures, including a national self-exclusion register. </p> <p>Lauren Levin, policy director of Financial Counselling Australia, says the activity statements will help gamblers make more informed decisions.</p> <p>“We couldn’t imagine our banks not telling us how much we’ve spent in a month, but up until now gambling companies have withheld this critical information,” Levin says.</p> <p>“Keeping people in the dark is good for business. The people I talk to rarely know how much they have lost. It is always very much higher than what they thought.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/commentisfree/2022/apr/18/a-generation-of-children-increasingly-think-gambling-is-inextricably-linked-with-the-afl\">A generation of children increasingly think gambling is inextricably linked with the AFL | Tim Costello</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Behavioural research <a href=\"https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/applying-behavioural-insights-online-wagering\">published by the government in 2020</a> found that people who saw their statements were more likely to bet less, and to correct their misconceptions<strong> </strong>about the probability of winning or their personal luck. It also found that moderate-risk gamblers, those with low financial literacy or those with loss-chasing tendencies were significantly affected by seeing the statements, making them an effective way to help those most at risk of gambling harm.</p> <p>Levin hopes the statements will be a way for people to start a conversation about responsible gambling limits.</p> <p>“A starting point for financial counsellors is to establish how much money has been lost, but many of the online gambling companies resist providing this bottom line. They just refuse,” she says.</p> <p>Tim Costello, from the Alliance for Gambling Reform, agrees.</p> <p>“Most people don’t think they’ve got a gambling problem,” Costello says. “They think they’ve just had a couple of losses and they’re going to be fine.” </p> <p>John says seeing the statements might have helped him, but it was just “one piece of a protection puzzle”.</p> <p>A year or so after he lost his redundancy payment, John received a lump sum comprised of an insurance payout for the disability caused by his mental illness, and his superannuation, totalling about $460,000.</p> <p>He opened accounts with two new online betting companies.</p> <p>“I lost the whole lot again, over about 9–12 months. That all disappeared,” John says.</p> <p>“The guilt was incredible. You’d say I’m never going to do this again. But with a lot of the companies … if I decided to have a couple of days off, I’d get a text at three in the arvo while I’m out walking the dog saying, ‘hey John, if you put in $5k today we’ll match that’. And you’d think, oh, if I don’t do that it’s like throwing money away.</p> <p>“It was like they had you on a hook and they could just keep bringing you back, bringing you back.”</p> <p>John tried, again, to make everything right. One of the companies said they would give him back $100,000 on the condition that he deposit it somewhere safe. So he opened an account with State Trustees and restricted it only to accommodation, utilities, medical and vet expenses.</p> <p>“Basically, I was self-harming in a financial sense rather than a physical sense … I was a credit manager, I spent my whole life looking after other people’s money, and then went and did this to myself,” he says.</p> <p>The gambling had repercussions for his family, which is why he asked for his surname not to be published. He lost the family home, his marriage disintegrated, and he’s struggled to find a way to explain what happened to his adult children. A constant support in his life is his labrador, whose presence, he says, has saved his life more than once.</p> <p>“I was a good dad, worked hard and had a good job,” he says. “A few pretty ordinary decisions and circumstances, and it’s totally changed my life.”</p> <p>Amanda Rishworth, federal minister for social services, said in a statement the Albanese government was “committed to reducing the prevalence of problem gambling in Australia” and that it was planning to implement the measures of the National Framework “without delay”.</p> <p>Advocates expect one of those measures to be the national self-exclusion register. John says this would have helped him immensely, “so that when you do get your fingers burnt you don’t jump back into the frying pan with another mob.”</p> <p>He also believes companies should force gamblers to set deposit limits and that, like credit, they should be measured against your ability to pay.</p> <p>“One night alone, between 10pm and 3am, I was able to deposit and lose over $116,000 – making big deposits of over $20,000. It would have been red flags all over the place [for the company] but nobody got in touch,” says John.</p> <p>“I put the money in there, I made that decision, but if these guys think they’re offering a safe and responsible gambling platform, well they’re not.” </p> <p><strong>Do you have a story? stephanie.convery@theguardian.com</strong></p> <p><em>• In Australia, <a href=\"https://www.gamblinghelponline.org.au/\">Gambling Help Online</a> is available by live chat and on 1800 858 858.

She is non-verbal.</p> \n<p>“I am literally fighting for her voice, that the NDIS have deemed ‘not value for money,’” Stephens said.</p> \n<p>In one video shared with Guardian Australia, Stephens asks Ella what she would like for breakfast.</p> \n<p>After three taps on the Liberator device, the response comes – “toast” – and Ella smiles at her mother.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"20626278-e579-49db-ba96-4343a6607012\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6X9s2IoGKdY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But the Liberator broke four months ago and Stephens’ attempts to have the National Disability Insurance Scheme fund the $7,000<strong> </strong>device have become entangled in a protracted battle at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where the agency has engaged top firm Clayton Utz.</p> \n<p>Stephens, who lives in Yarrawonga, on the New South Wales-Victoria border, said Ella had become increasingly frustrated because she was unable to use the device.</p> \n<p>“Her behaviours are a lot worse since the talker hasn’t been available – it’s pretty rough,” Stephens said.</p> \n<p>“I’ve even got a video of her where we’re sitting and playing a little bit. And she runs off straight away to get her talker, which doesn’t work. She wants to be able to communicate.”</p> \n<p>The talker device is part of Stephens’ appeal against reductions to Ella’s plan and denied supports first made in February 2021.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/15/two-year-wait-for-a-wheelchair-inquiry-hears-of-difficulty-accessing-ndis-for-remote-indigenous-communities\">Two-year wait for a wheelchair: inquiry hears of difficulty accessing NDIS for remote Indigenous communities</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Since September, Stephens has been among the growing number of families caught up at the AAT.</p> \n<p>Before coming to power in May, Labor had criticised the rising number of these appeals, the complicated and lengthy process for NDIS participants and the agency’s use of private law firms to defend the cases.</p> \n<p>Stephens said she had to gather a long list of new evidence for the tribunal. When that was completed, the agency’s lawyers had sometimes insisted on their own independent assessments anyway.</p> \n<p>One case conference was postponed, Stephens claimed, because the agency’s lawyers failed to attend.</p> \n<p>The family had acquired the talker device before Ella joined the NDIS.</p> \n<p>A letter from Ella’s speech therapist recommending the device be replaced after it broke was insufficient. The agency engaged an independent specialist who made their own assessment based on previous reports, without meeting Ella.</p> \n<p>That specialist suggested Ella could instead use an iPad with similar software loaded on to it, which would be much cheaper for the agency.</p> \n<p>But Stephens said that would require Ella to learn how to use a completely new device and program.</p> \n<figure

other supports.</p> \n<p>Stephens provided a letter from a continence nurse, but the agency wanted a separate assessment from a continence nurse unknown to Ella.</p> \n<p>An NDIA spokesperson said it was not “appropriate for the NDIA to comment on individual cases before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal”.</p> \n<p>“In order to fund supports, the NDIA must be satisfied that the support being considered meets the legislative requirements, including that it represents value for money and is appropriately funded by the NDIS,” the spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>“Supports may not be approved where lower-cost options are deemed a suitable alternative or are more appropriately funded by other support services.</p> \n<p>“The agency has an early resolution approach that assists participants by working with them and their representatives to resolve their matter as early in the AAT process as possible.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

By the end he had taken 16 touches, won zero headers, made no interceptions or dribbles, completed seven passes, and produced a willing but ultimately futile exercise in trapped energy, like an oversized fly bobbling its way down a window pane.</p> <p>New team, new style, new plans: but these are remarkable numbers. Has any player ever played 90 minutes in a Pep Guardiola team and completed seven passes?</p> <p>In the event Haaland was upstaged by Darwin Núñez, who came on with half an hour to go and made one and scored one in Liverpool’s convincing 3-1 win. Núñez provided an obvious counterpoint, a footballer instantly at home in Liverpool’s very defined idea of what a front three should look like. He ran hard through the middle. He looked direct and clear in his mind. As a case study in buying a player who clearly suits your pre-existing attacking style this was pretty compelling stuff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7ae60d7b986eb7cd83b4f6b41125ccc129d6178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7ae60d7b986eb7cd83b4f6b41125ccc129d6178/0_185_5269_3161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erling Haaland shows his frustration after missing a chance to score\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haaland shows his frustration after missing a wonderful chance to score.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The King Power had been a muggy, sweaty place at kick-off. The noise was raw and weirdly unbound, as though everyone present had just woken from a summer fever dream to find themselves pitched unexpectedly right back into this thing, this world, this energy. Which is, let’s face it, pretty much what has happened.</p> <p>The sight of Haaland on the City team sheet was an instant adrenaline spike: all those vowels, the symmetry of the consonants. Even his name is a unit. With 11 minutes gone he had his first proper City touch, coming deep to take a throw-in and trapping the ball with all the deftness of a man trying to catch a tennis ball in a frying pan.</p> <p>For a while he looked a little lost in this team of interlocking pegs. It is easy to become blasé, to forget that City play a type of football that is unlike anything else, a pressure wave where the movements repeat and multiply, the parts revolve and elide. Let’s chuck a baseball bat into the middle of that and see how it goes.</p> <p>City’s starting formation was a fluid 4-1-4-1, with only Rodri and Haaland keeping to a distinct part of the pitch ahead of the defence. But they were overrun at times. City always have too many players on the pitch. Here, for the first time they seemed not to have enough. It seems a facile observation, it is also true: the big advantage of not playing with a striker has been that extra man, the extra angles, the extra passing option. Control, possession, making a friend of the ball. This has been everything. How easy will it be to find new patterns?</p> <p>Liverpool took the lead through Trent Alexander-Arnold’s deflected shot, and for most of this game looked the more coherent, more grooved team. For City the issue isn’t so much that Haaland was bad (he was) or that he looked a mismatched part (he is). Everybody knows this, no one better than Pep himself, who knows this in vivid, granular detail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>This issue is how long will this bedding-in last, and what form can it take? Can Haaland simply walk through it? He might have the look of an indestructible force of engineered sporting will. But form and confidence are not inexhaustible substances. And the Premier League is a brutal kind of theatre.</p> <p>At the end Guardiola brushed away questions about Haaland’s lack of sharpness. “He has incredible quality,” he shrugged. This is of course correct, and it will be fascinating to watch exactly how his manager tries to bring this out. On the evidence here there is at least reason to be glad of one thing. Guardiola really does love coaching.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/30/rail-strikes-leave-commonwealth-games-city-with-almost-no-trains","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T19:55:41Z","webTitle":"Rail strikes leave Commonwealth Games city with almost no trains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/rail-strikes-leave-commonwealth-games-city-with-almost-no-trains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/30/rail-strikes-leave-commonwealth-games-city-with-almost-no-trains","fields":{"headline":"Rail strikes leave Commonwealth Games city with almost no trains","trailText":"‘Special shuttle’ one of few services running in Birmingham after the latest industrial action on the network","byline":"Jessica Murray and Mark Townsend","body":"<p>Rail strikes brought fresh misery for millions across the country on Saturday, including major disruption to Birmingham as it hosted one of the busiest days of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/commonwealth-games-2022\" title=\"\">Commonwealth Games</a>.</p> <p>The latest round of strikes during a summer of chaos for passengers prompted bitter exchanges between union leaders and ministers.</p> <p>As thousands of train drivers from seven operators, including West Midlands Trains and Southeastern, walked out over pay, vast stretches of the rail network in England and Wales were left with no services.</p> <p>It also meant there were no trains in England’s second biggest city apart from a “special shuttle” between Birmingham New Street and Birmingham International to help people reach Commonwealth Games events.</p> <p>Last night the Department for Transport (DfT) pointed out that Chiltern and Cross Country services into Birmingham were running and urged people with Commonwealth tickets to look at options.</p> <p>With frustration evident on both sides, Aslef earlier accused the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, of lying about negotiations over this summer’s rail strikes. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said: “We’re not dragging our feet in negotiations; we negotiate with 14 private companies. We do not work for the government or the DfT.”</p> <p>Whelan was responding to comments by Shapps, who had accused “militant union leaders” of bringing the country to a standstill.</p> <p>Writing in the Times, Shapps had said: “RMT [union] is stalling on reform and Aslef is dragging its feet in negotiations while both call more strikes.”</p> <p>Later, the Department for Transport issued a statement saying it was “misleading” to suggest that Shapps should get involved in negotiations over pay and working practices.</p> <p>Amid the mounting acrimony, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, entered the row by describing the strikes as a “cynical manipulation of the Games”.

Explaining the strikes, Whelan said they were “the last resort” and that many Aslef members had not received a pay rise for three years and wanted the “ability to negotiate”. “The people we work for have been making hundreds of millions of pounds and giving money to their shareholders,” Whelan said.</p> <p>The latest strike, carried out by about 5,000 members, also affected Arriva Rail London – which operates the London Overground – Greater Anglia, Great Western Railway, Hull Trains and Heathrow Express.</p> <p>No trains ran on Southeastern, while operators including Great Western – which runs services between England and Wales – had severely reduced services.</p> <p>Snow Hill station in central Birmingham was entirely closed, with picketers standing metres from the route of the Commonwealth marathon, which itself closed many roads in the city.</p> <p>Games organisers were encouraging ticket holders travelling locally to walk or cycle if possible, and said additional park and ride services were being put in place.</p> <p>An extra 600 buses were used to help visitors get to the 16 venues where events were taking place.</p> <p>Saturday’s statement from the DfT was issued to clarify the role of Shapps during the strikes.</p> <p>It said: “His role is to protect the public purse, ensuring value for money for the hardworking people of this country.</p> <p>“As such, he’s required to set the limits of taxpayer support and ultimately sign off on any deal, not to be involved in negotiating one, and his contracts with operators allow him to do precisely that.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/30/kentucky-rescue-victims-flooding","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T19:47:09Z","webTitle":" ‘We had to swim out’: Kentucky grapples with floods as search for survivors continues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/kentucky-rescue-victims-flooding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/kentucky-rescue-victims-flooding","fields":{"headline":" ‘We had to swim out’: Kentucky grapples with floods as search for survivors continues","trailText":"Tales of rescue and tragedy emerge as governor expects death toll to rise in one of the poorest regions in America","byline":"Edward Helmore","body":"<p>As the hunt for survivors goes on in Kentucky after a torrential storm dumped 10 inches of rain in a matter of hours, tales of rescue and tragedy are beginning to emerge from the wreckage of the natural disaster.</p> <p>The region, parts of which remain cut off from power and cellphone service, has recorded 25 people dead with the death toll likely to rise in the coming days as the costs in life and property damage from the flash flooding are compiled.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/kentucky-flash-flooding-death-toll-missing\">Catastrophic flash flooding kills 25 in Kentucky and at least a dozen missing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Knott county, one of the area’s hardest hit, judge executive Jeff Dobson said: “You feel like breaking down and you feel like giving up, but we have to stay strong for our people, for our county, and be there for them in a time of need.”</p> <p>The Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irc22dJgaGo\">said</a> that six children are among those taken by flood waters.

The key thing for them is to start the final well. That’s something Germany are very good at, which makes the first 20 or 30 minutes crucial. Germany will play with aggressive intensity right from kick-off, asking tough questions of England and not allowing them to settle.</p> <p>It explains why Germany often score first-half goals. To match them, opposing teams must be at the races, with concentration levels at 100% and players constantly communicating properly, verbally and non-verbally, throughout.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/10-moments-that-changed-womens-football-in-england\">Hope and glory: 10 moments that changed women’s football in England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The communication between England’s two defensive, or rather defensive-ish, central midfielders, Keira Walsh and Georgia Stanway, will be super-important against a team who press so well and whose organisation out of possession makes them extremely dangerous in transition. England are strong in transition, too, and, with Germany playing a high line, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/23/some-girls-spend-time-on-hair-and-makeup-but-im-here-to-play-football\" title=\"\">Walsh’s through passes </a>can enable the forwards to get behind the defence.</p> <p>Germany were brave to play such a high line against a fast and dynamic France side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/germany-france-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">in the semi-final</a> and there were moments when they looked vulnerable. There wasn’t much wrong with the gameplan but the players couldn’t quite find the right final ball.</p> <p>Just as Walsh is vital to England, so, too, is Germany’s midfield pivot, Lena Oberdorf, for her team. It’s hard to believe she’s only 20 because she is just so intelligent; she’s so good at slowing games down and controlling the tempo.</p> <p> She’s also brilliant at breaking up play, recovers the ball very quickly and knows when to concede fouls. Up against Oberdorf, Fran Kirby must work hard to find the space she needs.</p> <p>Popp will be on a mission to wound the Lionesses. The Wolfsburg forward is the focal point of a really aggressive front three who are experts at pressing and remain ever-dangerous out of possession. We’re all looking forward to seeing Popp’s much‑anticipated, no-quarter given duel with Millie Bright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7b69b3295e5228f38a28c9e5bec608ed7f44d89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7b69b3295e5228f38a28c9e5bec608ed7f44d89/0_36_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandra Popp celebrates her goal against France in the semi-final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandra Popp celebrates her goal against France in the semi-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whatever the tactics – and, like England, a Germany team unafraid to go direct can vary their style, playing in multiple ways – Popp remains relentless and relishes forcing opponents, goalkeepers particularly, into making mistakes. She’s extremely physical and uses her body well.</p> <p>But despite Germany’s strength in depth, Austria had them on the ropes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/21/germany-austria-womens-euro-2022-quarter-final-match-report\" title=\"\">in the quarter-final</a>, hitting the woodwork three times. Maybe England, blessed with better finishers and greater conviction, can employ similar tactics more effectively to disrupt this German machine.</p> <p>The assuredness and stability of Mary Earps, Bright and Leah Williamson can snuff out Germany’s quick attacking transitions and create a platform for Beth Mead, Kirby and Alessia Russo to continue creating and scoring goals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter!\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter!</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Popp’s work ethic on and off the ball is incredible and I know just how exhausted she leaves you – mentally as well as physically. When I played for Rosengård, Wolfsburg knocked us out of the Champions League thanks to two headed goals from … guess who? She’s a huge aerial threat and is extremely difficult to mark.</p> <p>Equally clever at linking play, Popp loves dropping deep – sometimes very deep – into midfield and dragging people out of position and she often serves as a decoy, creating space for teammates to score. Remember how her lovely dummy in the quarter-final against Austria conjured Lina Magull’s goal?</p> <p>Magull is so quick, creative and technically assured and, like Kirby, can change games. Ditto Klara Bühl who, providing she tests negative for Covid, will surely rejoin the attack. She is quick, dynamic and very good at setting traps for defenders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/women-euro-2022-final-england-germany\">England and Germany meet again for Euros final but goalposts have moved</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England will believe she can trouble Germany’s defence, where Marina Hegering and Kathrin Hendrich are not the quickest centre-backs. While Hegering is strong in the air, she is much less comfortable with the ball on the ground and Ellen White’s clever hold-up play and ability to spin markers is capable of causing chaos in Germany’s penalty area.</p> <p>Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, Germany’s coach, knows Mead and Lauren Hemp can cause numerous problems on the wings but she will have analysed the Lionesses’ own weaknesses. They include the space Lucy Bronze leaves behind her when she attacks from right-back, something Sara Däbritz could exploit.</p> <p>The technical ability of Däbritz and Magull has ensured Germany haven’t missed their injured midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsán quite as much as initially feared. But despite the wealth of creative talent in both teams, it wouldn’t come as a huge surprise if a set-piece proved decisive. Both sides can be susceptible to dead balls but it’s important to remember that, when the delivery is top quality and at top speed, set plays are very difficult to defend.</p> <p>Everyone knows Popp’s superb in the air at corners but, as with France’s Wendie Renard, it still doesn’t always stop her scoring a lot of goals from them. That pair are so good and so strong they’re inevitably going to get a high percentage of first contacts on the ball.</p> <p>Second-half substitutions could be as vital as set plays. The way Wiegman and Voss-Tecklenburg use benches packed with highly talented players of the calibre of Russo and Linda Dallmann may ultimately settle what should be a wonderful final.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/30/the-mighty-all-blacks-are-falling-can-they-rule-world-rugby-again","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T19:00:33Z","webTitle":"The mighty All Blacks are falling.

Only now, in times of extreme frustration and calls for coaching cleanouts, are their feats truly appreciated. Their like will probably never be seen again. </p> <p>Further coaching changes may help improve the All Blacks’ fortunes, but that theory is too dismissive of the northern nations’ significant improvement since 2015, with France and Ireland now leading the charge.</p> <p>The gap at the top has closed – and there is every reason to believe it will stay that way.</p> <p>From a New Zealand perspective, a total reset could be required. Projected quick fix solutions such as ushering in six-time Super Rugby-winning Crusaders coach Scott Robertson may not provide an instant cure.</p> <p>Written off and under siege as they confront rugby’s toughest assignment, the All Blacks could silence their doubters by pulling off upset victories against the world champion Springboks in the coming weeks.</p> <p>But even in that utopian scenario, New Zealand rugby’s deeper issues will not be addressed. Scratch the surface and a litany of challenges emerge.</p> <p>This week Hansen launched a scathing attack that placed responsibility for a series of failures squarely at the New Zealand Rugby board’s feet, saying the relationship between the board and players was “probably the worst it’s ever been”.</p> <p>Other issues include the number of teenage boys playing rugby falling at alarming rates for the past eight years – down 17% to 2018, at a time when basketball’s popularity grew 41%. This can partly be attributed to the professionalisation of schoolboy rugby, and the lack of focus on those below the elite first XVs. In Auckland alone the number of secondary school rugby teams fell from 225 to 181 between 2013 and 2018.</p> <p>The decimated grassroots scene, where many clubs have folded and amalgamated, continues to have a profound effect on participation and engagement, too, while crowds and ratings for the elite game are declining.</p> <p>New Zealand’s talent development, particularly that of the once dominant under-20s team, has declined since 2017, before a sudden revival this season.</p> <p>In the professional realm this year’s remodelled 12-team Super Rugby competition exposed a dearth of contrasting, confrontational styles. The absence of South Africa and, to a lesser extent, Argentina, leave largely homogenised contests that do not best prepare New Zealand’s players for the combative, suffocating Test arena. And while the recently signed $200m deal with US private investment firm Silver Lake offers financial security, the potential long-term pressure points of that arrangement remain unclear.</p> <p>As Blues coach Leon MacDonald noted earlier this year dwindling depth is another pressing concern. From America’s Major League Rugby to Japan and Europe, New Zealand’s stocks remain among the most popular to pillage.</p> <p>“It is an issue,” MacDonald said. “The depth of our players is getting less and less and less. That’s something we’ve noticed it’s becoming harder and harder for us to find the players we need.”</p> <p>A golden All Blacks era masked creaks that have evolved into cracks. But as the treasured pyramid head now threatens to topple, the Shaky Isles rumbles on the precipice of a reckoning with their national game.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/30/biden-covid-positive-test","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T18:49:50Z","webTitle":"Biden tests positive for Covid only days after testing negative","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/biden-covid-positive-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/biden-covid-positive-test","fields":{"headline":"Biden tests positive for Covid only days after testing negative","trailText":"US president had been taking Paxlovid, which has reported numerous cases of virus returning once medication is stopped","byline":"Guardian staff and agencies","body":"<p>Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1553450407074070529\">tested positive</a> for Covid-19 only days after testing negative and having apparently largely shrugged off an infection with the virus, the White House physician said in a statement.</p> <p>The president had contracted Covid and apparently recovered.

And regardless of the end result, there will be a nice moment for reflection. Naturally it’s my job to go out for 90 minutes to play, and win, but when we look back on this tournament as a whole, we’ll have really started something. I want tomorrow to be the start, to be a maker for the future.</p> <p>“I’ve only ever been in this football workplace but, in most workplaces across the world, women still have a few more battles to face to try to overcome. For every success we make, for every change of judgment or perception or the opening of the eyes of somebody who will now view women as somebody with the potential to be the equal of her male counterpart, that can create change in society.”</p> <p>If anyone had doubted why Sarina Wiegman made Williamson, a part-time accountancy student, England’s captain such concerns were banished as the 25-year-old warmed to her theme. “It’s a powerful message that, in a typically male-dominated environment, these strides we’ve made can be taken forward and impact everybody on a wider scale.”</p> <p>Wiegman confirmed she has no selection problems. “Everyone’s fit,” said England’s manager, who has tended to resist rotating her team. “We’ll make hard choices; everyone has the quality to play.”</p> <p>Wiegman, who led her native Netherlands to Euro 2017 glory, excels at understatement but even someone as low-key as her accepted playing in front of 90,000 at Wembley will be special.</p> <p>“I’m not stupid, I know it’s big,” she said. “It’s incredible and I enjoy that.

I don’t know if there’s a bigger moment for our players,” Voss-Tecklenburg said before they made their way out for the last session before Sunday’s final, into an arena that maintains a mythology, a mystique for them too, expressed in Berlin as becoming “Deutsch Wembley” when it hosts cup finals. It’s a stage that may be about to take on an extra significance, the hope expressed of a lasting legacy as well as another story to be told.</p> \n<p>Dietmar Hamann scored the last goal before Wembley was redeveloped. There was Euro 1996, 30 years of hurt becoming 56 that could finally end tomorrow. And, of course, 1966. Germans talk fondly too – and yes, they do talk fondly of ‘66 – about the quarter-final of the Euros in 1972.</p> \n<p>“I was born in 1967, so ...” Voss-Tecklenburg said, smiling. “But everyone knows the history between Germany and England, Wembley goals and penalties.” And now there is this, and it is special; bigger than the rivalry, transcending these teams, but also bigger for the rivalry.</p> \n<p>“England v Germany electrifies football fans,” the Germany coach added. “There is such a tradition, a history. For me, there is just one football and this is a football feast. If we could have chosen a dream, we would have chosen England in this final, no one else.” Sitting alongside her was Svenja Huth. When she walked into the room, she sat down, looked up at the cameras – dozens and dozens of them – looking back at her, and then took hers out too. Holding up her phone, she took a photograph. There would be more when they went on to the turf.</p> \n<p>“We’re very excited and the stadium is impressive even when empty: this will be the next big challenge but we’re looking forward to it,” Huth said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"584e243f-31ac-47a7-8dc3-877e9e07385b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>When Kateryna Monzul blew the full-time whistle to end the Euro 2022 final it marked the end of a long and emotional journey.

The Euros have been huge in Germany: more than 17 million people watched the semi-final. There has been something almost pure about the experience, the coach suggested. About the sport, not the money. About society too. The line has been that this is not about equal pay but equal <em>play</em>. When it was put to her that the finalists are the teams with the highest win bonuses, and that when she played the bonus was a teapot, she said: “We were amateurs but those Euros were worth as much as the Euros tomorrow.”</p> \n<p>She added: “[The public reaction back home] reaches us in different ways. The normal football fan who hasn’t watched a lot of women’s games, celebrities, public screenings. We’re getting a lot of messages. And we talk about one football. I am a football fan, so I am a football fan. I don’t care what kind of match: I love an under-10s game as much as a women’s game or a man’s game. It is nice that this competition has had all the [sporting] attention with the Tour de France. It’s not just our games, it’s all the games, the whole thing. It’s been a great tournament and as a football fan I’m really happy that we can show this quality and that people respect our female players.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/women-euro-2022-final-england-germany\">England and Germany meet again for Euros final but goalposts have moved</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“The development we have had makes me very happy. We dreamed of this in the 1990s and now I have the privilege of being the national team manager and being part of the story. This morning I was sitting in my hotel thinking: ‘Wow, it’s really happening.’ I saw the stadium and thought: ‘It’s a reality.’ We have been rewarded. Later I will be able to reflect a bit more calmly.”</p> \n<p>Yet there was reflection here, too. “We have players all over the world who [now] have the chance to make football their profession,” she said. “These are values that are bigger than whether the bonus is €20,000, €40,000 or whatever; that doesn’t change our love for the sport, our attitude. What we want now is more equality: better stadia, more spectators, more TV time, better kick-off times, a more attractive league. We just want to make the next steps and I hope that the sport in general will have a bigger importance in schools, in education and in politics.”</p> \n<p>Asked whether Germany had nothing to lose, the coach admitted that the pressure may be greater for England but shot back: “[It’s] a football match.” She added: “On the way here Svenja and I talked about the progress we have seen, the processes. We have grown and we want to continue that. This should give us strength. If they are better we will congratulate them, but we’re not planning to lose. It is a journey that seems extraordinary to some people but we always said we wanted to win every game.</p> \n<p>“We will only win if everything that is happening in Europe, in Germany, in England ends in a sustainable way. This has to be a chance for all the countries. This has to continue. We have to take the next steps in football for women.

For the first time, the curtain is being raised on the new English season in July. The Community Shield has been played in April (don’t ask), May (see April), August, September and October (including the last time it wasn’t played in August, back in 1958), but never before in July. Welcome to 2022-23, a feast/slog like no other, with a World Cup for a winter break and a Champions League final in the middle of June. </p> <p>There’s only one way for it to start: with a meeting between the best two teams in England, perhaps the best in the world. (I appreciate Real Madrid would disagree, and their shiny, silver, 74cm, 11kg argument is a persuasive one.) The Community Shield between Liverpool and Manchester City is being played at Leicester’s King Power Stadium, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/lionesses-england-charge-transform-girls-football-euro-2022-final\">Wembley is booked for a festival tomorrow</a>.</p> <p>For reasons too boring to explain, mostly involving the FA Cup, this is only the second Community Shield involving City and Liverpool. But they have dominated English football for the last four or five years, and their rivalry is the greatest in this country since Arsenal and Manchester United saw each other out there. </p> <p>Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp have set obscene standards, making 90+ points the norm rather than the exception. Now they are aiming even higher by signing classical centre-forwards. There’s nothing false about Erling Haaland and Darwin Nunez, a pair of nines who are as true as a dying man’s final words. </p> <p>Evolving a great team comes with risk (see: Juan Veron and Ruud van Nistelrooy, Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack, even Ian Wright), but the main reaction to the signings of Haaland and Nunez is excitement - for the teams involved, for the Premier League and for the folk who keep goalscoring records.</p> <p>If the presence of Haaland and Nunez (and Kalvin Phillips, Julian Alvarez and Fabio Carvalho) isn’t a decent selling point for an otherwise underwhelming fixture, then I don’t know what is. Today is our first chance to see them in a semi-competitive game; to compare and contrast and despair when Andy Carroll starts trending on Twitter.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>5pm.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-30T15:20:21.033Z\">at 4.20pm BST</time></p>  </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/30/liverpool-manchester-city-community-shield-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T18:26:30Z","webTitle":"Salah and Núñez seal Community Shield glory as Liverpool sink Manchester City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/liverpool-manchester-city-community-shield-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/30/liverpool-manchester-city-community-shield-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Salah and Núñez seal Community Shield glory as Liverpool sink Manchester City","trailText":"Liverpool lay down a marker for the new season with a 3-1 win over Manchester City in the Community Shield at the King Power Stadium","byline":"Jamie Jackson at the King Power Stadium","body":"<p>As an augury of the 2022-23 season Liverpool will be the happier as Jürgen Klopp’s side already appear a slick team ready for serious combat.</p> <p>Manchester City do not.

An opening gambit was to sell a dummy and shoot – he found only side-netting but City had a warning they failed to heed as, too often, the No 11 was allowed to wreak havoc.</p> <p>Seven minutes had gone when Guardiola offloaded a first rollicking of the term: João Cancelo was the victim for going back toward goal instead of finding Jack Grealish with an escape ball up the left.</p> <p>City were being swamped so when Kevin De Bruyne forced a corner and the same player took the short delivery and curled in a cross Nathan Aké could, at last, threaten Adrián’s goal though he failed to connect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe1ffcb5fbd5173ccde5111dd81ea17ca31e6120\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe1ffcb5fbd5173ccde5111dd81ea17ca31e6120/0_196_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohamed Salah celebrates after putting Liverpool in front from the penalty spot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohamed Salah celebrates after putting Liverpool in front from the penalty spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latter was Guardiola’s surprise selection for the day – the Catalan usually has one – as the Dutchman nearly sold to Chelsea was preferred to John Stones. Aké, though, was part of a rearguard that struggled to stymie Liverpool.</p> <p>A prime instance of Salah’s freedom came when he controlled and dinked the ball inside to Alexander-Arnold. The right-back, seeing Andy Robertson swoop towards the far post, executed a chip to the Scot who should have finished.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/guardiola-not-concerned-after-haaland-fails-to-fire-on-manchester-city-debut\">Guardiola not worried by Haaland misses as Klopp praises Núñez impact</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of the noise emanated from the red section of the venue, all of the action from those in the same colour livery. Thus, when Alexander-Arnold struck there was scant surprise. Salah – again – was found, this time by Thiago Alcãntara. And, again, the right-back awaited to his left: Salah tapped the ball to him and a bending shot beat Ederson via Aké’s forehead.</p> <p>City, stung, had De Bruyne soon running in on a Riyad Mahrez threaded pass but the Belgian missed. Haaland, at this juncture, was a non-factor, limited to the odd touch and zero chances. Finally he had two of the latter. After bundling Robertson aside he made Adrián save but then, in the same passage, appeared awkwardly one-footed when skewering a cross with his left when the angle was made for his right.</p> <p>City rallied as the interval neared, closing the 45 minutes how they would want: controlling ball and territory near Liverpool’s goal. But, no equaliser came – a Mahrez pea-roller simple for Adrián to collect an apt image of their toothlessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"289df78d358d17ca5bb75a97a630eb9e7044b4fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/289df78d358d17ca5bb75a97a630eb9e7044b4fd/0_113_3290_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trent Alexander-Arnold opens the scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trent Alexander-Arnold opens the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Obrien/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the teams were named Haaland had been the one summer signing in the XIs, which meant Kalvin Phillips and Álvarez, Guardiola’s other fresh recruits, were replacements for City as, for the FA Cup holders, were Klopp’s new men – Núñez and Fabio Carvalho.</p> <p>If each manager made no changes for the second half, Liverpool were soon, once more, carrying the threat. From a free-kick on the left Robertson dropped the ball into City’s area before Aké, leaping, headed clear. Next the menacing Alexander-Arnold marauded toward Ederson and was repelled near the six-yard box, Robertson crashed in a cross, and Jordan Henderson looked to nip in down the right before turning back into traffic.</p> <p>Guardiola now made a move by making two switches: the ineffective Haaland might have been one but he escaped as Grealish and Mahrez were hooked, Phil Foden and Álvarez entering. At this juncture Roberto Firmino was also sacrificed – by Klopp – for Núñez so the land’s leading two rivals each now had their new top-gun marksman in action.</p> <p>What was a surprise was how static City were with Haaland in the ranks: Guardiola, this evening at least, lost the fluid attack-play that has been so scintillating and successful for City due to the Norwegian’s reluctance to drop off the front.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was until Álvarez’s leveller when Haaland did precisely this – finding space and passing to De Bruyne. His cross was volleyed by Foden at Adrián and when the forward challenged the keeper the ball squirmed to Álvarez whose strike stood – following a lengthy check for offside.</p> <p>But, now, came a second VAR inquest: Craig Pawson was sent to the pitch-side monitor and adjudged that Rúben Dias handled Núnéz’s header. Salah coolly scored the penalty before Núñez sealed the victory in stoppage time.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/30/tuvalu-beach-volleyball-team-lose-to-england-but-win-hearts-and-minds","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T18:22:00Z","webTitle":"Tuvalu’s beach volleyball team take stage for nation hit by climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/tuvalu-beach-volleyball-team-lose-to-england-but-win-hearts-and-minds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/30/tuvalu-beach-volleyball-team-lose-to-england-but-win-hearts-and-minds","fields":{"headline":"Tuvalu’s beach volleyball team take stage for nation hit by climate crisis","trailText":"Pacific island pair lost to England at the Commonwealth Games but won hearts and minds in Birmingham","byline":"Tumaini Carayol at Smithfield","body":"<p>The Commonwealth Games are renowned for some of the biggest sporting nations competing side-by-side with countries that rarely have the opportunity to display themselves on the international stage.

The 4,000 spectators encircling them were equivalent to around 35% of the population of Tuvalu, the third-least populous independent country in the world with 11,000 inhabitants. “We’re not used to it,” said Isaac.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/30/commonwealth-games-2022-the-action-on-day-two-in-birmingham-live\">Commonwealth Games 2022: swimming, boxing and cricket on day two – live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their path to this moment was unique. Isaac, previously an indoor volleyball player, had joined forces with Malosa two months ago. They were bronze medallists at the Pacific Mini Games in June, a multi-sport event among the smaller territories in Oceania.</p> <p>They have had a few training camps in Australia, but back home in Tuvalu, not a single beach volleyball court existed. “We have beaches but they are sloped,” said Isaac. “We didn’t really manage to get a court until last month when we were coming to the Games.”</p> <p>Merely having a place to train is a common obstacle for any aspiring athlete in Tuvalu, a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Australia. For other athletes, such as the rest of their five-man squad, the main sporting base is the runway of Funafuti International Airport, the only open space in the archipelago. Since it receives two planes a week, the runway becomes filled with young people playing football, rugby and enjoying life. The athletes carve out their own space to train among the population.</p> <p>Their joyful presence in Birmingham is paired with the stark reality of their country’s predicament: Tuvalu is in harm’s way as the climate emergency approaches. The island sits three metres above sea level and scientists predict that they could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/16/one-day-disappear-tuvalu-sinking-islands-rising-seas-climate-change\">submerged in 50-100 years</a>. At Cop26 last year, Tuvalu’s foreign minister, Simon Kofe, recorded a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/08/tuvalu-minister-to-address-cop26-knee-deep-in-seawater-to-highlight-climate-crisis\">speech standing knee-deep in the ocean</a> off Funafuti, the capital, to highlight the problem. “We are sinking,” he said.</p> <p>Over the past few decades, the climate crisis has altered the way of life in Tuvalu considerably. Rising sea levels mean that saltwater submerges its soil, forcing the island to import most of the food it consumes. Temperatures have risen and storms are more forceful, but rainfall, which provides the majority of Tuvalu’s drinking water, is decreasing. Ciguatera poisoning from fish that ingest micro-algaes has increasingly become an issue.</p> <p>The country’s inhabitants have had to come to terms with its stark future and some of the squad see their presence as an opportunity to draw attention to their predicament.</p> <p>It is also a reminder of the facade of fairness in international competition. Sport is no meritocracy when there are enormous disparities in wealth and facilities, the significant funding and top-class facilities of athletes from countries such as Britain and Australia deeply contrasting with the playing conditions for many others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2022/jul/29/commonwealth-games-2022-complete-medal-table\">Commonwealth Games 2022: complete medal table</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it is an opportunity. On the court, they took it, remaining competitive until the end against a distinguished professional pairing. The Tuvalu duo played with smiles on their faces, fist-pumping their successes and encouraging each other throughout. </p> <p>Charged with finishing the majority of their attacks and manning the forecourt, Isaac continually showed off his guile, deftly manipulating the ball around the court.</p> <p>Tuvalu kept the contest tight at the beginning and enjoyed their best spell in the second set, pulling the score back from 4-10 to 9-11 and attracting cheers and support from the crowd. They lost 21-10, 21-12 and departed with their smiles still intact.</p> <p>“This is a really important part of us. Representing our small population. We are not even representing Tuvalu but the whole Pacific Islands,” said Isaac.</p> <p>Before the Tuvaluan pair arrived in Birmingham, they knew almost nothing about the city. Isaac chuckled as he noted that he knew Aston Villa, but not Birmingham. By the time they left the arena they had learned enough: rain began to fall over the temporary stadium, coating the thick sand of the makeshift beach.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/30/pregnant-woman-shocked-gp-anti-abortion-leaflet-society-protection-unborn-children-spuc","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T18:00:32Z","webTitle":"Pregnant woman shocked after GP ‘gave her anti-abortion leaflet’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/pregnant-woman-shocked-gp-anti-abortion-leaflet-society-protection-unborn-children-spuc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/30/pregnant-woman-shocked-gp-anti-abortion-leaflet-society-protection-unborn-children-spuc","fields":{"headline":"Pregnant woman shocked after GP ‘gave her anti-abortion leaflet’","trailText":"Woman was reportedly handed information from the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children at London clinic","byline":"Shanti Das","body":"<p>A pregnant woman who told her GP she was considering having an abortion says she was left “shocked and traumatised” after being given a leaflet for an anti-abortion group.</p> <p>The woman, 38, says she was seeking treatment for a bladder problem on 19 July when a doctor at All Saints Medical Centre in Plumstead, south-east London, asked whether she was pregnant.</p> <p>When she said that she was, she claims the male GP asked whether it was “happy news”, before giving her a leaflet for the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) when she said she “wasn’t sure” and was considering a termination.</p> <p>The leaflet, entitled Abortion – Your Right to Know, had phone numbers for services run by anti-abortion groups that claim to offer pregnancy support. It also listed potential risks of abortion, which it falsely said included depression, anxiety, eating disorders, PTSD, infertility and breast cancer.</p> <p>The woman, who asked not to be named because her family do not know about the pregnancy, also claims the doctor provided inaccurate advice about fertility, and told her having an abortion was likely to affect her ability to conceive in future.</p> <p>She says she left the appointment in shock. “When I looked at the leaflet properly, I noticed it had a day-to-day ‘what’s going on with your foetus today’ calendar, and day one is, ‘A new life is created,’” she said. “It was really upsetting. It didn’t make me feel guilty because I have modern views on abortion, but that’s what it felt like it was designed to do.”</p> <p>South East London Integrated Care System, which brings together NHS services and local councils, said: “We take matters like this very seriously and are currently investigating the alleged incident with the GP practice.”</p> <p>Guidance from the General Medical Council, which regulates medical practitioners, clearly says that doctors “must never express their personal beliefs to patients in ways that exploit their vulnerability or are likely to cause them distress”, and must ensure information they share with patients is objective, accurate and up to date. The NHS website says having an abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer or mental health issues, or affect a woman’s chances of becoming pregnant in future.</p> <p>The charity that issued the leaflet, SPUC, is a prominent anti-abortion group with a history of spreading misinformation about abortion. In 2019 it was exposed for launching a <em>Toy Story</em>-themed campaign, aimed at children, which falsely claimed foetuses can feel pain just 10 weeks after conception.</p> <p>GPs in other parts of the UK have told the <em>Observer</em> they have been sent leaflets by anti-abortion charities. In those cases, the leaflets were not given to patients, but Dr Pam Lowe, of Aston University in Birmingham, who is an expert in campaigning by anti-abortion groups, said the incidents suggested wider efforts by campaigners to target doctors in the hope they might distribute the leaflets, either accidentally or because they were sympathetic. “The worry is some people might rely on that information because they’re getting it from their doctor,” she said.</p> <p>Dr Katie Cairns, a GP in Belfast, said she was sent unbranded leaflets promoting abortion “reversal”, an unproven treatment, in 2020. Another GP, Dr Liz Bates from Birmingham, said she had been sent anti-abortion leaflets by an unknown source “about 18 months ago”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/16/women-who-wish-they-werent-mothers-roe-v-wade-abortion\">The women who wish they weren’t mothers: ‘An unwanted pregnancy lasts a lifetime’ </a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a separate incident about three years ago, a patient in Cornwall found an SPUC leaflet in her GP surgery waiting room, according to MSI Reproductive Choices. Dr Jonathan Lord, NHS gynaecologist and medical director at MSI, said the information contained in leaflets he had seen was “false, biased, designed to frighten women and cause guilt”, and that any cases of patients being given leaflets would be “worrying”. “It would be deeply irresponsible – but given the tactics used by anti-abortion groups they may not have realised the leaflets were even there, or how misleading they are,” he said.</p> <p>Kerry Abel, chair of Abortion Rights, a pro-choice campaign group, said misinformation had the potential to “delay access to abortion, potentially making the procedure more dangerous”.</p> <p>The SPUC claimed it had “only ever provided leaflets to GPs who have requested them”.

It said the NHS must review its recruitment processes to ensure that “no international health and care staff are being subject to punitive repayment clauses in their contracts”.</p> <p>The report, published last week, went on: “Those who are subject to repayment clauses must be released from them, and future NHS contracts must not contain repayment clauses.”</p> <p>It also pointed to an increased risk of modern slavery, adding that labour enforcement bodies must work with councils, employers and recruitment agencies to tackle exploitation.</p> <p>The recommendations come amid a rise in cases of suspected modern slavery in the health and social care sector. The Care Quality Commission has recorded 16 cases in 2022 so far – more than double the figure for the whole of 2021, when seven cases were identified, and about five times the figure for 2020.</p> <p>The Department of Health said it would shortly be publishing updated guidance on the use of repayment clauses and took “any reports of unsafe and illegal employment practices” in the health and care sector “very seriously”. <br><br>An NHS England spokesperson said the health service was committed to ensuring all international healthcare staff were “supported to thrive”, adding that it was exploring whether further guidance was needed with partners “across government and the health system”.<br><br>Repayment clauses are contract terms that stipulate workers will need to pay money if they leave their job within a certain period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92de62e01dc7cf6fe59dc617ed472c4a357410e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92de62e01dc7cf6fe59dc617ed472c4a357410e5/0_0_3830_2298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt with a bag over his shoulder leaving a BBC studio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Hunt, the health committee chair, said the issue should be a ‘top priority for the new prime minister’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Practice varies by employer, but the clauses often cover hiring expenses such as flights to the UK, visas and the fee for taking language and competency exams. Some also include the costs of mandatory training, which workers hired in the UK are not routinely required to pay. Often, the breakdown of fees is unclear.</p> <p>Workers affected by repayment terms have been pushed into debt or locked into long-term payment agreements to cover the fees. Others become trapped in their jobs despite illness or poor working conditions because they are unable to repay.</p> <p>The select committee report cited the <em>Observer’s </em>investigation as well as evidence from NHS managers, unions and others across the sector.</p> <p>Gamu Nyasoro, clinical skills and simulation manager at Kettering General Hospital NHS foundation trust, said in her evidence that she knew of cases where workers wanted to return home but could not “because they have been given exploiting contracts that you cannot leave until you pay them something like £10,000”.</p> <p>The trade union Unison said the clauses were used to “exploit migrant workers and to intimidate them into staying with poor employers”.</p> <p>Clauses penalising workers for leaving their jobs have previously been found to be unlawful. In 2019, an employment tribunal ruled that an Indian nurse had been subject to an “unenforceable penalty clause” after the care home she worked for deducted £2,000 from her wages for “training costs” when she left before the end of her two-year contract.</p> <p>The recommendation for the clauses to be scrapped in the NHS came as part of a report into wider workforce issues in the health and social care sector, which identified a critical shortage of more than 50,000 nurses in the NHS, with 490,000 extra jobs in social care likely to be needed over the next decade.</p> <p>Hunt, the committee chair, said tackling the crisis must be a “top priority for the new prime minister”.

Millions of us who had spent our footballing lives watching agonising defeats, tearful exits and a collective failure to live up to indisputable individual talent now found ourselves staring at our TVs in a dissociative state. We were watching our side in the knockout stages of a major tournament, but where was the familiar anxiety, the impending dread?</p> <p>When England’s men won their semi-final in the Euros 12 months ago, our bodies understood the drill. We went a goal down. We went to nerve-shredding extra time. And yes, we won, but not until we were drenched with sweat and misery. So what were these strange goosebumps doing on our forearms? Were we having – was this even possible – fun?</p> <p>The Lionesses’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/26/england-sweden-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">4-0 bonanza</a> is one that will live on not just in the memory but also in our “WTF just happened?” exchanges on WhatsApp. And even if England’s women lose to Germany today, even if there are runners-up medals instead of a glorious homecoming, the past four weeks themselves will count as a victory. Georgia Stanway lasering a penalty into the corner of the net; Mary Earps making a fingertip save over the crossbar; Alessia Russo backheeling the keeper; Beth Mead being Beth Mead.</p> <p>Euro 2022 has been set alight by the host nation’s performance and record numbers will watch the final as a result. Who knew following England could feel this good? And what took us so long to get here?</p> <p>We know the answer to the last one, at least. Only the youngest of fans have escaped football’s long tradition of discriminating against women. For decades, its leaders and gatekeepers declared that women were less capable, less suited and ultimately less important to the sport, an attitude that – who could have predicted it? – poisoned public perception and convinced girls that it wasn’t for them.</p> <p>The audiences for the matches at these Euros, both in the stadiums and on sofas at home, show how much has changed in the past couple of decades, but some of that prejudice remains, which is why the tournament sponsor is running an ad campaign against online misogyny, “Sexist Hate Stops With Men”.</p> <p>Because it started with men, of course. It was men who tried to suffocate the women’s game in a fit of jealousy 100 years ago and the irony should be lost on no one that it was the increasing popularity of the women’s game that provoked its demise. Victorian society’s prudish codes <em>had</em> previously ruled these pastimes unfeminine (and yes, there were probably plenty of women who swallowed that line too).</p> <p>But Britain was undergoing rapid social change – the kind to which we can relate today – when a group of female workers at a munitions factory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/sep/09/england-women-football\" title=\"\">formed the Dick, Kerr Ladies side</a> and they drew vast crowds to their matches following the First World War. The men who ran the game didn’t like that at all and for the next 50 years they banned women from playing at their grounds, which was pretty much all of them.</p> <p>The names of the women who played in the early days of women’s football – women such as Florrie Redford and Jennie Harris – remain obscure. Those who played during the ban, in parks and on rugby pitches, are even less well known. And then there are the thousands who played in its aftermath, who endured decades of sexist derision and organisational indifference and underfunding, because they loved the game, even when they weren’t supposed to.</p> <p>Until the mid-2000s, Scandinavia’s countries led the development of women’s football in Europe, which is why their national teams have significant rolls of honour – and why England’s demolition derbies against Norway and Sweden are so significant. After years of lagging behind, the FA has spent a decade turning the Women’s Super League into one of the best women’s football leagues in the world, taking it professional in 2018.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a sport where we don’t just witness dedication to the game, but to the wider cause of equality and solidarity.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clubs who lost out in the process – some of them, such as Doncaster Rovers Belles, with long and important histories – complained that money was talking too loud, and they were being edged out, although it’s hard to disagree with the results. Investment, both from the FA and the Premier League clubs that have established their own domestic teams is finally paying off on the international stage.</p> <p>The appointment of Sarina Wiegman, too, looks far more inspired than that of her predecessor, Phil Neville, the man who would have led TeamGB at the Tokyo Olympics if he hadn’t suddenly received a better offer from Inter Miami. Wiegman was the obvious choice the moment she interviewed – having taken a perennially underperforming Netherlands team to victory in the last Euros – and she has had a transformative effect on an England team that has previously lost three successive semi-finals in major tournaments. They are unbeaten during her tenure, with 104 goals in their 17 wins.</p> <p>So where do we go from here? Today’s Euros final is already the greatest thing that has happened in the English game even before it kicks off. wWe should applaud women such as Sue Campbell, the FA’s director of women’s football, who have done so much to bring it about. We should celebrate the long history of players, supporters, coaches and administrators who have dedicated themselves to this sport over more than a century, against great odds.</p> <p>And in doing so, we should recognise the spirit of solidarity and the commitment to equality that has long infused the women’s side of the sport. Which means ensuring that increasing professionalism does not decrease diversity, as elite teams move their training locations to suburban academies, making them less accessible to young players in the inner cities.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the ever-increasing profile of the women’s game will continue to attract investment: the question is who invests and how? Premier League clubs, and the venture capitalists who back them, are already eyeing it greedily. Any contributions they make to increasing gender parity, improving facilities, sharing main stadiums are to be welcomed. But they should not come at the expense of the integrity and values the women’s game has upheld.</p> <p>• Emma John writes on sport for the Observer and the Guardian</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Japanese company HIS recently ran online tours of locations used in the filming of <em>2gether</em>, while some Thai language teachers have also begun offering lessons that specialise in the slang used in BL dramas.</p> <p>Monruethai Harada, a Thai language teacher at Jaya &amp; 3S Groups in Tokyo, said she has seen a 20-30% increase in students wanting to learn Thai after BL dramas became popular in 2020. Most of them are women aged about 30, though one recent student was 75 years old. “She really loves to watch the boys’ love dramas. She said it’s the most exciting and thrilling ever,” said Monruethai.</p> <p>While BL has its roots in Japanese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/manga\" title=\"\">manga</a> comics, Thai production companies have transformed the genre by adapting it for TV and producing a flurry of popular series, said Rujirat Ishikawa, assistant professor at the School of Cultural and Creative Studies, based in Tokyo’s Aoyama Gakuin University. “In the past, I don’t think people believed there was a big market for the boys’ love dramas,” she said.</p> <p>Thai BL dramas first boomed in 2020 at the height of the pandemic. “Because of Covid, [people] had plenty of time,” said Ishikawa.</p> <p>In Japan, similar TV series are usually only accessible to viewers who have a paid subscription but Thai broadcasters are more relaxed about uploading content online, said Ishikawa. “[Audiences] just say: ‘We watch it on YouTube, it’s free, why not?’” Fans often add subtitles in their languages so that others can also enjoy the dramas.</p> <p>“You can see the internet power here and how it spreads,” said Ishikawa, adding that most fans are drawn to the series by the attractive male actors, the often happy story lines and the music.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Viewers might misunderstand that Thailand is a gay paradise, which is totally not true</p> <footer> <cite>Kangwan Fongkaew, academic</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Thailand’s struggling tourism industry, the popularity of the dramas is welcome news, though commenters point out that the Thai government, despite talk of building the country’s soft power abroad, has struggled to embrace the genre.</p> <p>“Initially, the Thai state appeared to be in an awkward position about the broadcast of Thai BL drama via traditional mediums like free TV channels,” said Poowin Bunyavejchewin, senior researcher at the Institute of East Asian Studies at Thammasat University in Bangkok. “Yet man has to eat. The Thai state needs money. It is as simple as that.”</p> <p>The majority of BL series are shown in Thailand on alternative platforms that link with smartphones, such as Line TV, added Poowin, which “may ease the concerns of Thai conservatives, as sweet erotic love between young men has not been highly visible to them”. Nor has it interfered with the traditional soap operas broadcasting on free TV channels.</p> <p>But some in the LGBT community have mixed feelings about the dramas. BL offers a happier, more positive portrayal of same-sex relationships than elsewhere in Thai media, where gay love tends to end in tragedy, said Kangwan Fongkaew, a lecturer at Burapha University in Chonburi province, who has studied the representation of LGBT communities in Thai media.</p> <p>But while this is in some ways refreshing, BL dramas do not offer true representations of society. They are generally focused on “puppy love” and omit the realities faced by gay men in Thailand, which still does not have basic rights such as equal marriage, said Kangwan.</p> <p>Viewers, added Kangwan, “might misunderstand that Thailand is a gay paradise, which is totally not true”.</p> <p>The leading characters are also predominantly light-skinned, middle class and educated, he said: “The boys’ love series don’t reflect the real diversity of the LGBT community in Thai society, and that’s why the stigma and discrimination against LGBT are still going on right now.”</p> <p>But he also believes the dramas could bring change, especially if their portrayals of same-sex love become more nuanced or political: “I am still hopeful.”</p> <p>Soontaree, who is gay, said she supports the BL series, adding that the dramas are a powerful tool for Thailand: “I can see it clearly. When part 1 [<em>of I Told Sunset About You</em>] was on air and it was the Covid time, I still earned an income from that because the fans were coming to visit the restaurant.”</p> <p>Although some visitors can become a bit overwhelmed, she welcomes the fans. If they are busy taking photos and enjoying the scene, she said, at least they will not be rushing her to serve them: “They don’t pressure me to cook as fast.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/30/alarm-grows-as-orban-prepares-to-take-pure-nazi-rhetoric-to-us","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T17:50:31Z","webTitle":"Alarm grows as Orban prepares to take ‘pure Nazi’ rhetoric to US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/alarm-grows-as-orban-prepares-to-take-pure-nazi-rhetoric-to-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/30/alarm-grows-as-orban-prepares-to-take-pure-nazi-rhetoric-to-us","fields":{"headline":"Alarm grows as Orban prepares to take ‘pure Nazi’ rhetoric to US","trailText":"Hungarian leader’s aide who quit over ‘race mixing’ remarks said his words have a chilling potential","byline":"Flora Garamvolgyi and Shaun Walker in Budapest","body":"<p>A longstanding adviser to Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán who resigned last week has warned him that his far-right rhetoric could have tragic consequences.</p> <p>The Hungarian leader sparked a backlash at home and abroad with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/viktor-orban-against-race-mixing-europe-hungary\" title=\"\">a recent speech</a> in which he spoke out against “race mixing”. Soon after, Zsuzsa Hegedüs, a sociologist who has known Orbán for 20 years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/longstanding-adviser-to-viktor-orban-resigns-over-pure-nazi-speech\" title=\"\">handed in her resignation</a>, criticising the prime minister for what she called a “pure Nazi” speech.</p> <p>“I am a Jew. And our generation’s job is to stop anything like this because we have seen what happened. Not just with Jews. In Rwanda as well. Ethnic hatred leads to genocide,” said Hegedüs in an interview with the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>Orbán’s speech came at a showpiece annual gathering in Romania last weekend, which the Hungarian leader often uses to make important announcements. During his speech, he said mixing between Europeans was acceptable, but Europeans mixing with non-Europeans created “mixed race” people.</p> <p>“We are willing to mix with one another, but we do not want to become peoples of mixed race,” said Orbán. He added that western European countries where this was seen as acceptable are “no longer nations”.</p> <p>Orbán, who in April <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/viktor-orban-expected-to-win-big-majority-in-hungarian-general-election\" title=\"\">won a fourth consecutive term as prime minister</a>, has frequently used far-right rhetoric, especially since 2015, when he emerged as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/migration-crisis-hungary-pm-victor-orban-europe-response-madness\" title=\"\">Europe’s fiercest opponent of welcoming refugees and migrants</a>. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/hungary-viktor-orban-george-soros\" title=\"\">repeated attacks on the Hungarian-born Jewish businessman and philanthropist George Soros</a> have also been widely criticised as antisemitic.</p> <p>Orbán thrives on controversy, and his anti-migration stance, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/15/hungary-passes-law-banning-lbgt-content-in-schools\" title=\"\">regressive policies</a> on LGBT rights, have made him a darling of the international right. In the coming days he is due to travel to Dallas, Texas, and give the opening speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an influential assembly of American rightwingers.</p> <p>In May Orbán spoke at a special CPAC session in Hungary, when his speech referenced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/cpac-conference-budapest-hungary-viktor-orban-speaker\" title=\"\">the “great replacement”</a>, a conspiracy theory popular on the far right that claims there is a liberal plot to change the ethnic makeup of the US and European countries through immigration.</p> <p>While Orbán’s statements have frequently prompted criticism from liberals, the reaction to Orbán’s words about mixing races has been stronger than usual.</p> <p>The Hungarian Academy of Sciences condemned the comments, calling them “scientifically untenable” and “a dangerous ideology”, while Hungary’s chief rabbi, Róbert Frölich, also criticised the speech.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I told Viktor about the things I found unacceptable before. I shouted at him sometimes.

For some time, she had been concerned about the prime minister’s “illiberal turn”, but felt the recent speech crossed a line.</p> <p>“I told Viktor about the things I found unacceptable before. I shouted at him sometimes. But he never crossed this line before. It really was a Nazi speech,” she said.</p> <p>Numerous international politicians have also spoken out in disgust over the speech.</p> <p>“Racism is a poisonous political invention. There should be no place for it in Europe where our strength comes from diversity,” said European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans.</p> <p>The US envoy to combat antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt, criticised Orbán’s “use of rhetoric that clearly evokes Nazi racial ideology”.</p> <p>Dani Dayan, the chairman of <a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/\" title=\"\">Yad Vashem</a>, the Holocaust memorial centre in Jerusalem, also drew parallels with the Nazi past. “The statement made by the prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, is all too reminiscent of ideologies associated with the horrible atrocities of the Holocaust. The Holocaust teaches us that we must address such expressions swiftly and directly,” said Dayan.</p> <p>In a sign that the backlash may have blindsided Orbán, he took the unusual step of backtracking somewhat, insisting that he was not talking about the mixing of races, but of cultures.</p> <p>“I don’t want Hungary to become an immigrant country. It is not a question of race for us. It is about cultural differences,” he said during a visit to Vienna last Thursday.</p> <p>“Sometimes I can be ambiguous. We are talking about a civilisational position. We are proud of what Hungary has achieved in the fight against racism,” he added.</p> <p>As Orbán heads to the CPAC, it is unlikely that many on the American right will have been perturbed by his speech.</p> <p>“The far-right represents an increasingly present part of the Republican community. The party has changed so radically. Ideas like the great replacement theory have become the mainstream for them,” said Rick Wilson, a former Republican strategist and co-founder of the <a href=\"https://lincolnproject.us/\" title=\"\">Lincoln Project</a>, an anti-Donald Trump political action committee, in an interview.</p> <p>Orbán had warm relations with Trump and praise of Hungary’s “illiberal democracy” has frequently appeared on Fox News’s <em>Tucker Carlson Tonight</em> show. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/aug/07/tucker-carlson-hungary-viktor-orban-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Carlson spent a week in Hungary last year</a> and painted the country as a conservative paradise.</p> <p>“Orbán is seen as anti-Europe, anti-immigration, anti-elite and anti-woke, which appeals to Republicans and conservatives,” said Tim Miller, the former political director of Republican Voters Against Trump.</p> <p>Matt Schlapp, chairman of the CPAC, was asked last week if Orbán was still invited to open the gathering. “Let’s listen to the man speak. We’ll see what he says.

They also said Labour had to show it was ready for the responsibilities of government. However, Graham said that Labour was facing a “dangerous moment” because it was losing relevance for the thousands of workers she was helping fight for better pay and conditions.</p> <p>“It is undoubtedly the fact that Labour is becoming more and more irrelevant to workers,” she said. “It’s unfortunate, but it is a fact.

I think there’s a real crossroads here for Labour. I don’t know anyone who thinks what happened to Sam Tarry is correct. He’s on a picket line. He’s talking about wages. Is Labour now saying that people should have a national wage cut? If you’re not keeping up with inflation, you are having a cut in pay.”</p> <p>She also warned that she found it difficult to justify continuing to fund Labour through affiliation fees. She said the issue would be debated by union members at a crucial meeting next summer. Unite continues to give more than £1m a year to Labour, but the funding has fallen significantly since Starmer took over as leader.</p> <p>“I have no doubt it will come up with the Unite rules conference, I’ve got absolutely no doubt,” she said. “The last time it was debated, it was only narrowly won. I think it’s harder and harder to defend.</p> <p>“There’s no point giving money to a party that is basically sticking two fingers up to workers. It’s almost like an abusive relationship. You are the voice of workers in Westminster; we are their voice on the ground. I think it’s a very difficult conversation and I think that members will decide.”</p> <p>The news comes amid concerns within Labour over the handling of a week of rows, including between members of Starmer’s frontbench team. It has led to renewed frustrations over the direction of the party and Starmer’s performance, at a time when the Conservative leadership election has seen the Tories descend into bitter “blue on blue” warring.</p> <p>Simon Fletcher, a former adviser to the Labour leader, warned that the rows had revealed the “limitations of Labour’s project as it stands” and that too much focus was on simply differentiating Starmer from Jeremy Corbyn. Writing on the <em>Observer</em>’s website this weekend, he states: “The Labour leadership’s problem is that it gives every impression of being more obsessed with differentiating itself from the previous leader than with the millions of people getting hit through their pay and their energy bills.</p> <p>“An excess of caution leaves big issues unresolved, lying around like unexploded ordinance, only to go off at the wrong time. As a portent of how Labour would govern, it suggests an administration prone to be buffeted about by events.</p> <p>“In truth, the Labour leader’s office does not seem to have a theory to fully explain the present situation in Britain, one that then aims to use all the policy levers to tackle the consequences of it. As one experienced Labour campaigner described it to me, ‘their mindset is benevolent managerialism.’ Labour’s detachment is why it struggles to tell a persuasive story about what is happening to people and, therefore, ‘why Labour’.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, former deputy leader Roy Hattersley uses a piece in the <em>Observer</em> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/now-voters-know-we-cant-make-brexit-work-labour-must-call-for-closer-bond-with-europe\" title=\"\">call on Starmer to rethink his Brexit stance</a>. He calls on the party to secure access to the EU’s single market in exchange for higher European immigration. “This is not the time for Labour to talk of making Brexit work,” he writes. “It is time to expose its failure and to offer a radical alternative – a closer working relationship with the EU.”</p> <p>However, Labour sources said that Starmer and the party had made a series of significant interventions in recent weeks – including making it clear that it wants to make Brexit work – and set out economic plans in a speech last week. They also said recent polling showed that claims about Starmer being out of touch with workers were untrue, and the party had to be seen as serious about forming a government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/sam-tarry-rail-workers-are-covid-heroes-im-proud-to-be-on-the-picket-line-with-them\">Rail workers are Covid heroes – I’m proud to be on the picket line with them | Sam Tarry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We wouldn’t choose to pick a fight with unions over this,” said a senior source. “Do we want pay rises for workers? Of course, we do. But we’re also trying to balance the fact that we’re hoping to be in government soon. This has not been about making an example of Sam or picking a fight. It would be chaos if people were able to appear in the media and make policy without consultation. That can’t be how collective responsibility works.</p> <p>“There is nothing in terms of evidence to suggest that Keir Starmer has done anything but improve support for Labour among working people. We’re trying to reconnect with them and there is evidence that we are succeeding in that.”</p> <p>In response to Tory threats to impose more anti-union laws, some union leaders have raised the prospect of joint action reminiscent of the general strike, and Graham ruled nothing out. However, she said she had no interest in “glorious defeats” and had instead been planning new “strike plus” measures designed to gain an upper hand on employers offering unfair deals to employees. These include using forensic accountants to investigate companies and gain leverage over them.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jul/30/russia-ukraine-war-outcry-over-attack-killing-ukraine-pows-kyiv-awaits-un-all-clear-for-grain-shipments","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T17:11:50Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv hits back at Russian calls to ‘hang’ and ‘humiliate’ Azov fighters – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/30/russia-ukraine-war-outcry-over-attack-killing-ukraine-pows-kyiv-awaits-un-all-clear-for-grain-shipments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jul/30/russia-ukraine-war-outcry-over-attack-killing-ukraine-pows-kyiv-awaits-un-all-clear-for-grain-shipments","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv hits back at Russian calls to ‘hang’ and ‘humiliate’ Azov fighters – as it happened ","trailText":"Ukraine says comments from Russian embassy Twitter account shows Russia ‘is a state sponsor of terrorism’","byline":"Nadeem Badshah (now), Joe Middleton (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62e565be8f08af33ff4a42a1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-30T17:11:50.384Z\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">A summary of today's developments</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Ukrainian officials have denounced a call by Russia’s embassy in Britain for fighters from the Azov regiment to face a “humiliating” execution</strong>, AFP has reported.

As it passes 9am in Kyiv, here is a summary of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Russia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> have both launched criminal investigations into strikes that have reportedly killed at least 40 Ukrainian prisoners of war </strong>who were held at a pre-trial detention centre in the village of Olenivka<strong>, </strong>after both countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/ukraine-denies-attack-on-donbas-prison-that-russia-claims-killed-40\">blamed the other side for the attack</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has accused Russia of a “petrifying war crime”</strong> <strong>over the killings</strong> and called on world leaders to “recognise Russia as a terrorist state”.</li> \n   <li><strong>Ukraine has said it is ready for grain exports to leave its ports again </strong>but is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/ukraine-grain-ships-un-shipping-insurance\">waiting for the go-ahead</a> from the United Nations, which it hoped it would receive on Friday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Horrific video has emerged that appears to show a Russian soldier castrating a Ukrainian prisoner</strong>, who other reports suggest was subsequently murdered. The footage, reviewed by the Guardian, was originally posted on pro-Russian Telegram channels. Aric Toler, at the investigative outlet Bellingcat, suggested that the video – which shows a Russian soldier, wearing a distinctive black, wide-brimmed hat, approaching another figure who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/video-appears-to-show-russian-soldier-castrating-ukrainian-prisoner\">has his hands bound and is lying face down</a> with the back of his trousers cut away – appeared to be authentic .</li> \n   <li><strong>At least five people have been killed and seven injured in a strike on a bus stop in the city of Mykolaiv</strong>, according to the regional governor, Vitaliy Kim. Graphic images from the scene showed the street littered with bodies.</li> \n   <li><strong>Vladimir Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that Russia staunchly supported China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity</strong>, after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, warned the US president, Joe Biden, against “playing with fire” over Taiwan in a phone call on Thursday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, said on Friday that putting the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline into operation was not an option</strong> as this would only play into the hands of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. There is growing anger in Germany over soaring energy prices.</li> \n   <li><strong>Aleksandr Viktorovich Ionov</strong>, a Russian operative who was subjected to US sanctions on Friday,<strong> has been charged with using political groups in the US</strong> to advance pro-Russia propaganda, including during the initial stages of the invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US treasury department said on Friday it had imposed sanctions on another individual alongside Ionov, as well as on four entities</strong> that “support the Kremlin’s global malign influence operations and election interference activities”, including in the US and Ukraine.</li> \n   <li><strong>Belarus recalled its UK ambassador </strong>on Friday in response to what it called “hostile and unfriendly” actions by London.</li> \n   <li><strong>North Macedonia plans to donate an unspecified number of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine</strong> as it seeks to modernise its own military to meet Nato standards, its defence ministry said on Friday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Germany would deliver 16 Biber bridge-layer tanks to Ukrainian forces,</strong> the German defence ministry said.</li> \n   <li><strong>A Ukrainian court on Friday reduced to 15 years a life sentence handed to a Russian soldier in May for premeditated murder,</strong> in the country’s first war crimes trial.</li> \n   <li><strong>A Russian ammunition depot in the southern Kherson region has been destroyed</strong>, Ukrainian officials said on Friday.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, has said Russian forces in Ukraine are in “a very difficult spot”</strong>, and that Putin’s strategy was akin to putting his forces through a meat grinder. In his opinion, he said, Russia was “certainly not able to occupy the country. They may be able to carry on killing indiscriminately and destroying as they go, but that is not a victory.”</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-30T08:55:04.082Z\">at 9.55am BST</time></p> \n</div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/30/failing-to-stand-with-working-people-labour-taking-electrorally-risky-stance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T17:00:30Z","webTitle":"By failing to stand with working people, Labour is taking an electorally risky stance | Simon Fletcher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/30/failing-to-stand-with-working-people-labour-taking-electrorally-risky-stance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/30/failing-to-stand-with-working-people-labour-taking-electrorally-risky-stance","fields":{"headline":"By failing to stand with working people, Labour is taking an electorally risky stance","trailText":"Keir Starmer’s backtracking on nationalisation looks like an excess of caution, when he should be boldly reaping the benefits of Tory disarray","byline":"Simon Fletcher","body":"<p>Last week was a watershed for Keir Starmer’s Labour, laying bare the limitations of Labour’s project as it stands. The party aimed to start the week with a set-piece speech on economic growth. Instead, it succeeded in turning it into rows with itself – over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/starmer-says-he-wont-be-ideological-labour-renationalisation-row\" title=\"\">dropping public ownership of the big utilities</a>, its stance on the wages crisis and its handling of strikes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/labour-party-is-sticking-two-fingers-up-at-working-people-says-unite-boss\">Labour party is ‘sticking two fingers up’ at working people, says Unite boss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer\" title=\"\">sacking of the shadow transport minister, Sam Tarry</a>, symbolised many of these difficulties. The leader’s office says it had no choice, after an unauthorised media round, breaking collective responsibility. But it was also reported that he was sacked for saying that it was “not acceptable to offer below inflation pay rises” because it would be a real-terms wages cut for workers.</p> <p>It’s a raw nerve: cost of living pressures are ripping through British society, with the biggest collapse in living standards for decades. UK real pay levels look set to slump by 6% in the next two years, the worst fall in the G7. Millions are being forced to accept worse pay and working conditions. Measures such as fire and rehire and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/20/boris-johnson-plan-break-rail-strikes-agency-workers\" title=\"\">legalising agency work for strike-breaking</a> hang over them. Consequently, trade unions are being placed in the centre of the argument.</p> <p>In the midst of this, the Labour leadership’s problem is that it gives every impression of being more obsessed with differentiating itself from the previous leader than it is with the millions of people getting hit through their pay and energy bills.</p> <p>Starmer <a href=\"https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/\" title=\"\">gave clear commitments</a> when he stood for leader in favour of public ownership. Binning those policies last Monday caused anger across the party and further strained Labour’s relationship with the unions. But it’s also about the process – dripped out in response to media questions. The Labour leader tried to clarify that he had not in fact changed Labour’s position on public ownership for the railways, though his clarification itself left many confused. An excess of caution leaves big issues unresolved, lying around like unexploded ordnance, only to go off at the wrong time. As a portent of how Labour would govern, it suggests an administration prone to be buffeted about by events.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Public ownership of the energy companies would place Labour on the side of those who are struggling badly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The stated reason for Starmer’s broken commitment to public ownership – the pandemic has changed things – is wrong. Covid has actually strengthened the case for changes in ownership. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/21/uk-covid-19-rail-rescue-measures-dft-franchising\" title=\"\">rail franchising system collapsed during lockdown</a> and millions of pounds went straight into profits for the private rail companies.</p> <p>Likewise, the public is living in dread over energy bills. Public ownership of the energy companies would place Labour on the side of those who are struggling badly. On the day Labour ditched the policy, the <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/research-analysis/reports/fairer-energy-system-families-and-climate\" title=\"\">Trades Union Congress published a detailed report</a> on how to make it happen.</p> <p>We are asked to believe that Labour’s position on the utilities is pragmatic, not ideological. But if the outcome in almost every case is the maintenance of the failing status quo, the ideology is inescapable.</p> <p>In truth, the Labour leader’s office does not seem to have a theory to fully explain the present situation in Britain, one that then aims to use all the policy levers to tackle the consequences of it. As one experienced Labour campaigner described it to me, “their mindset is benevolent managerialism”. Labour’s detachment is why it struggles to tell a persuasive story about what is happening to people and, therefore, “why Labour?”.</p> <p>Ferocious infighting in the Tory party is tearing great holes in its credibility. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are definitely beatable, though it is far from a foregone conclusion. Labour cannot afford to waste the moment. By failing to stand with working people trying to defend their living standards, Labour is in danger of walling itself off from them. It is electorally dangerous.</p> <p>With the Tories in meltdown, Labour can afford to shed some of its timidity and launch a stronger case that connects to the cost of living crisis – and it should.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s focused around price, and the status that these items attempt to signal. It raises the question: how do style status symbols work in 2022?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c0365f22541317050b8b26947bd596475c63d35a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0365f22541317050b8b26947bd596475c63d35a/0_12_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss arrives for the BBC Conservative party leadership debate last week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss last week. Nadine Dorries highlighted her choice of earrings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even during a cost of living crisis, fashion’s expensive symbols of status retain power, and remain popular with consumers. Financial results for fashion brands were released for the first half of 2022 last week. Revenues were up 48% at Moncler, where a short down jacket with the bear logo on the sleeve costs £1,235. At conglomerate LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, revenues in the second quarter of 2022 were up 19%, with luxury bags credited. A classic Louis Vuitton Speedy with monogram is £1,030. Meanwhile, Sunak’s favourite, Prada, saw its first half sales rise 22%. Its popular Cleo shoulder bag – with Prada triangle logo – is £1,800.</p> <p>“Clothing has been deeply embedded with status for millennia because clothing is a social language,” says Emma McClendon, fashion historian and author of <em>Power Mode: the Force of Fashion</em>. “It’s the way we make our bodies socially legible.” The symbols shift over time. “The way you show strength and power might be different in 2022 than 2016 or 2012,” she explains.</p> <p>Status symbols of any moment are defined by what the dominant elite looks like. In the digital era, that is the Silicon Valley super-rich, figures who are more likely to be in hoodies and trainers than the suits of the traditional establishment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/may/14/happy-30th-birthday-mark-zuckerberg-time-to-dress-like-a-man\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, hardly a style icon in the conventional sense, masterminded this shift. McClendon argues his casual outfits were “a really conscious thumbing his nose at the suited Wall Street sense of success. Because, ultimately, what this is about is how each given era or each given individual is trying to define success and power.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some public figures pick up working-class tropes to align themselves with something that seems more authentic</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Rodgers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sunak has bought into the Silicon Valley definition. For photos of him working on the budget at the height of the pandemic in 2020, he was pictured in a hoodie from Californian brand Everlane, a choice intended to frame him as a poster boy of contemporary success and prosperity.</p> <p>Discussion around status symbols also takes in class and who is “allowed” to wear these coveted items. This also changes over time. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, Danniella Westbrook was on the cover of the <em>Sun</em> in head-to-toe Burberry check, causing outrage – and the fashion house to reduce the amount of check it used for fear of alienating its upper-class customer base. Daniel Rodgers, a fashion writer who wrote about the impact of Westbrook’s outfit, says that the look would be less disruptive now. “It’s increasingly difficult to tell if someone’s middle class, working class or upper class because of the way that the internet and social media blurred all of those markers,” said Rodgers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7607bf3cf8ef54eb87c4a471baa08eca571fb482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7607bf3cf8ef54eb87c4a471baa08eca571fb482/1587_0_2558_3199/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian at Paris Fashion Week in early July.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Kardashian at Paris Fashion Week in early July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pierre Suu/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He does, however, see women in the public eye still provoking outrage for stepping outside their perceived boundaries. “Kim Kardashian is an example,” he says. “Pre Kanye, when she was beginning to get dressed by luxury houses such as Givenchy, people were like, ‘why is this basically Page Three girl getting access to this?’ It really displaces a lot of people’s [ideas of] class. It’s something so embedded within us, so for someone to transgress those boundaries, for a lot of people, that’s offensive, [because it’s] not respecting the kind of natural order in the world.”</p> <p>Signifiers are further complicated in that status can now come from the “cool” and authenticity often tied up with working-class culture. “There are pop stars or public figures trying to pick up the tropes of the working class and align themselves with something that seems more authentic,” says Rodgers.</p> <p>Rachel Worth, author of the 2020 book <em>Fashion and Class</em>, says this is not new. She points to the French revolution when “it became dangerous to be wearing high-class fabrics such as silk. While looking casual and working class became politically correct.”</p> <p>Worth, whose forthcoming book is focused around sustainability, also argues that status now can come from signalling you are conscious of your carbon footprint. “These things go in cycles,” she says. “In the 19th century, secondhand was superior, even for working people. It’s like we’ve come back to that.”</p> <p>“It is fashionable to be a knowing consumer,” agrees Caroline Stevenson, head of cultural and historical studies at London College of Fashion, “to know where your clothing came from, to carefully curate your wardrobe and to show appreciation for the more refined things in life.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/25/kate-moss-desert-island-discs-bbc-model\">Take off your bra!

In this context, Sunak’s and Truss’s consumption of new items, whether fast fashion or high end, could be seen as bad form, in the same way that Kylie Jenner’s boast about using her private jet to travel 17 minutes between two Californian airports triggered her branding as a “climate criminal” in a viral tweet.</p> <p>McClendon says that what the two candidates wear communicates different takes on status. If Sunak’s are “classic symbols of wealth – the bespoke suit, the designer duds”, Truss’s earrings are “a sort of reverse status [symbol] … There’s a sense of status, of power within a democratic system, representing the people.”</p> <p>Charlie Porter, the author of <em>What Artists Wear</em>, believes Truss’s choice to wear fast fashion chimes with her cheap thrill policies. “[She] is campaigning to cut taxes for short-term feel-good benefit,” he says. “The promise is of more disposable income in the face of rising fuel and grocery bills. Disposable income usually means shopping. Shopping makes people feel good in the short term, often at the expense of what could do them good in the long term.” Sunak’s luxury items, meanwhile, “can be used to skewer the wealthy, while still being items of desire and aspiration”.</p> <p>McClendon added: “I think we’re in a really complicated moment with wealth because there’s both the prolonged pandemic, inflation, the financial woes, but also sustainability. That makes aspiration really complicated.”<br></p> <p>Style status symbols are alive and well in 2022 but, as ever, it’s far from simple.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/jul/30/tour-de-france-femmes-stage-seven-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T16:42:24Z","webTitle":"Tour de France Femmes: Van Vleuten wins brutal stage to claim yellow jersey – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/30/tour-de-france-femmes-stage-seven-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/jul/30/tour-de-france-femmes-stage-seven-live","fields":{"headline":"Tour de France Femmes: Van Vleuten wins brutal stage to claim yellow jersey – as it happened","trailText":"With just one stage of the race remaining, Annemiek van Vleuten took charge of the general classification with a brilliant solo breakaway","byline":"Barry Glendenning","body":"<div id=\"block-62e55f1a8f08af33ff4a425a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-30T16:42:24.835Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Van Vleuten roars into overall lead</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Annemiek van Vleuten blew apart the Tour de France Femmeswith a 60-kilometre lone attack in the first mountain stage of the week-long race, taking a memorable stage win and the overall race lead with one day’s racing to come.

But from the first whistle to the last England looked mostly comfortable as they got to task defeating the world No 7 side.</p> <p>Though the opening phases were punctuated by physical clashes as the sides tested each other’s resolve under the post, it was the Roses who took the early initiative.</p> <p>Goal attack Eleanor Cardwell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/england-begin-commonwealth-games-netball-title-defence-with-easy-victory\">whose impressive impact on Friday from the bench</a> saw her awarded with a start, was clinical in the shooting end as 34-year-old wing defence and local Birmingham product Stacey Francis-Bayman was quick to reap the rewards of her defending unit. Their combined effort allowed England to produce a 35-20 lead at half-time.</p> <p>Those that had called the game to be closer were subsequently vindicated at the start of the second half. Errant elbows and umpire whistles defined a third term where the Malawi Queens surged. Growing into the occasion, they became increasingly disruptive in their quest to try and recover the scoreline. The eight interceptions, three deflections and three unforced errors they drew out of England meant they held the hosts to a quarter-score draw at the conclusion of the 15.</p> <p>Showing no sign of panic, Thirlby opted to continue making changes, seizing the opportunity to use all of her players with a mind on the challenges that await her team. Those that came on, and in some cases returned to court, in the game’s concluding 15, more than reasserted England’s authority.</p> <p>Assisting the Roses in taking the final quarter 18-8 was goal defender Layla Guscoth. The qualified doctor finished with five gains, two interceptions and four deflections in her 45 minutes of court-time, fuelling talk the 30-year-old is the world’s best in the position.</p> <p>“It was a good test,” Thirlby said. “It was definitely what we needed; practicing being asked questions along the way in order to ready yourself for games deeper in the tournament.</p> <p>“That third quarter isn’t good enough. We recognised what they were doing well against us, but we were too slow to choose the best course of action to stop it in its tracks. To a degree some of that can be expected but we’re not accepting of it. So we’ll look to try and rectify some of that for next week. But the first half overall we should be pretty pleased.”</p> <p>Centre Laura Malcolm, who finished on 15 feeds, echoed her coach’s approval with the result: “We’re really happy with it. It was definitely a lift on yesterday. There’s still a lot to work on so we’re still on our journey of trying to get to where we want to get to, but as long as we keep improving we’ll get to where we’ll want to be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>England’s Roses will return to court on Monday to face Northern Ireland.

After a torrid few days, in which she was so weak that she needed help packing her suitcase, the Tokyo Olympic time trial champion recovered in time for the first mountain stage.</p> <p>“I couldn’t believe this was possible after being so sick,” she said. “Being here in the yellow jersey – it’s a little bit of a miracle.”</p> <p>Attacking with fellow Dutch rider Demi Vollering (Team SD Worx), she took the race by the scruff of the neck on the first climb, the Petit Ballon, and immediately put distance between her and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/tour-de-france-femmes-marianne-vos-consolidates-lead-with-stage-six-success\">the overnight race leader Marianne Vos</a> (Jumbo-Visma). “I had to try, because I’d lost some seconds,” Van Vleuten said. “My style is always attacking and not waiting for the final.</p> <p>“I reconned the stage and saw the Petit Ballon was hard, and after six days of waiting and surviving and recovering, I wanted to make the biggest time gaps. That means going on the first climb.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea06486cdbb269c04fc87a150a324b3a916a3375\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea06486cdbb269c04fc87a150a324b3a916a3375/0_175_5235_3141/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Van Vleuten storms ahead of her rivals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Van Vleuten storms ahead of her rivals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Van Vleuten, who won the 2019 World Road Race title in Yorkshire with a similar solo break, then moved clear of Vollering on the 11% gradients of the Col de Platzerwasel, the second of the first category climbs, to open up a three and a half minute lead at Le Markstein. Given her track record, an attack in the mountains was predictable. Few, however, given her sickness, expected such a complete demolition of her peers.</p> <p>“I’m a bit older than the other girls so can do a lot of training,” Van Vleuten said. “I want to make something clear. It’s not that my colleagues don’t train as much as I do. It has something to do with training years. I have a lot of capacity, then it comes down to fitness, and that’s something I’m really good in. This stage suited that really well.</p> <p>“If my colleagues continue for some more years, for sure they can do it. The stage was so hard I knew that if I was fit enough after being sick, it would be my day.”</p> <p>Her rivals may now wish that they had tried to lose Van Vleuten earlier in the week, when she was at her most vulnerable, particularly on the gruelling gravel roads of the Aube. “Monday and Tuesday, given her state of health, we didn’t push things,” her teammate Aude Biannic said. “She said it was her worst day on a bike and wasn’t even sure if she could finish the stage.

This day will always be remembered.”</p> <p>For Rosenior, in interim charge after Wayne Rooney’s resignation, this represented his first game as a first-team manager, a day he had been building towards since coaching a school team in his teens and picking teams with his dad, Leroy, a former manager. Rosenior is unfazed about having to make the big calls – on his first day he released a player whose kids attend the same school as his – but there is no such thing as a selection headache just yet, a thin squad meaning the team picks itself. The starting lineup included seven signings, including the lively Brighton loanee Haydon Roberts, who excelled from left-back, and eight players who were in the Championship last season, four with Derby.</p> <p>Rooney called on Friday to wish Rosenior good luck. Another symbol of the togetherness born from the chaos was in the dressing room at full-time. Krystian Bielik, who joined Birmingham on loan on Friday in order to give himself a chance of making Poland’s squad for the World Cup, wished everyone all the best.</p> <p>“I finished the teamtalk, I turned around and Krystian is standing there,” Rosenior said. “He’s not leaving the club because he doesn’t want to be here, he’s leaving to follow his dream and we should appreciate that and give him the best chance to do that.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"food/2022/jul/30/english-craft-cider-producers-demand-the-same-protection-as-champagne","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T16:14:29Z","webTitle":"English craft cider producers demand the same protection as champagne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jul/30/english-craft-cider-producers-demand-the-same-protection-as-champagne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/jul/30/english-craft-cider-producers-demand-the-same-protection-as-champagne","fields":{"headline":"English craft cider producers demand the same protection as champagne","trailText":"Supermarket brands of the tipple, made with added water and sugar, are ‘giving cider a bad name’","byline":"Jon Ungoed-Thomas","body":"<p>From the crab apples pressed during the Roman conquest to the Kent orchards planted during the reign of Henry VIII, the making of British cider is one of the country’s finest heritage assets. So much so that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/sep/10/welcome-to-the-cider-revolution-fiona-beckett\" title=\"\">craft producers</a> are now demanding protection from modern commercial ciders with added water and fruit flavourings which they say are undermining the reputation of the traditional products.</p> <p>They say leading supermarket brands such as Strongbow, Frosty Jack’s and Kopparberg cider may contain more added water than apple juice. They are calling for new regulations as part of the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/29/craft-beer-brewers-say-rise-in-alcohol-duty-threatens-their-business\" title=\"\">review of alcohol duty</a>.</p> <p>John Lawrence, founder of Lawrence’s Cider in the village of Corton Denham, on the Somerset-Dorset border, said: “True cider has got to be made from 100% apple juice, but a lot is made from apple concentrate and water with quite a high alcohol content. It gives cider a bad name.”</p> <p>Lawrence harvests at least six varieties of cider apples from local orchards, including tremlett’s bitter and yarlington mill. They are pressed and the pure juice is fermented and left to mature for six months. Lawrence makes up to 7,000 litres a year, the threshold at which alcohol duty is paid. Under the current rules, cider is only required to contain a minimum of 35% juice content. The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), which also promotes real cider and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/06/perry-pear-cider-round-up-fiona-beckett-drinks\" title=\"\">perry, also known as pear cider</a>, is calling on HM Treasury to raise the minimum fruit content to 50% as part of its review of alcohol duties.</p> <p>Gillian Hough, Camra’s real ale, cider and perry campaigns director, said: “Consumers need confidence that when they are buying cider or perry it is a quality product that contains more juice than water.”</p> <p>Jim Callender, founder of the Real Cider website, said the drink was part of the national identity. “It’s like England in a glass. It should be protected in the same way as champagne,” he said.</p> <p>Callender said the major producers promoted their drinks with bucolic imagery but they often contained sugary syrup and flavourings which were not used in craft ciders. “This is commercial cider syrup,” he said.</p> <p>Cider makers are also concerned that some producers import concentrated apple juice from Poland and China, undermining demand for the country’s apples. The National Trust warned earlier this year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/blossom-falls-80-of-small-orchards-in-england-and-wales-lost-since-1900\" title=\"\">orchards are vanishing </a>from the British landscape, with an area the size of the Isle of Wight lost since 1900.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7378930d4ab92490fa9eab4757f15fa8bc1158\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7378930d4ab92490fa9eab4757f15fa8bc1158/0_2_1114_1114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman and child gather cider apples\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craft producers such as Lawrence’s Cider make their drink from 100% apple juice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @lawrencescider/instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Craft producers would like to see more British apples used in mass-produced ciders. The big producers say they already provide strong demand for the country’s apple orchards, planting new areas and working with farmers to protect them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/24/short-guide-to-british-cider\" title=\"\">Britain’s cider industry</a> is worth more than £2bn a year, but sales slumped during the pandemic. The 2022 annual cider report compiled by Westons, which is based in Much Marcle, Herefordshire, and produces ciders with 100% juice, found consumers are increasingly buying premium and craft ciders while sales of cheaper white cider have fallen.</p> <p>Cheaper white ciders have been controversial because they have been associated with alcoholism and homelessness. One of the most popular brands, Frosty Jack’s, sells for £3.90 for 2.5 litres and contains 7.5% alcohol. It also lists water as its first ingredient.</p> <p>The National Association of Cider Makers <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmhealth/368/368we16.htm\" title=\"\">told the Commons health committee</a> it was “one of the first signatories to the Portman Group Code of Practice on the Naming, Packaging and Promotion of Alcoholic Drinks and its members fully subscribe to it”.</p> <p>Strongbow, the country’s most popular cider brand, also lists water as its first ingredient. It is understood that Heineken, Strongbow’s owner, uses in addition to its English apples some imported apple concentrate which the company says is required to ensure a sweeter taste.</p> <p>A Heineken UK spokesperson said: “In Herefordshire, we operate the world’s largest cider makers. Every year, we use many hundreds of millions of British apples from over 8,000 acres of orchards in and around Herefordshire to make our ciders.” The company said the water content of its product was commercially sensitive.</p> <p>Aston Manor, the Birmingham-based cider producer which owns Frosty Jack’s, said: “Between 2014 and 2019 we planted 1,000 acres of new orchards in Herefordshire – adding over 350,000 new trees to the landscape.” The company said Frosty Jack’s was a “blend of apple juice concentrate and locally grown fruit.” Kopparberg did not respond to a request for comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/live/2022/jul/30/football-league-new-season-kicks-off-with-cardiff-v-norwich-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T16:13:40Z","webTitle":"Football League clockwatch: Cardiff 1-0 Norwich, Blackburn 1-0 QPR – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/jul/30/football-league-new-season-kicks-off-with-cardiff-v-norwich-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2022/jul/30/football-league-new-season-kicks-off-with-cardiff-v-norwich-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Football League clockwatch: Cardiff 1-0 Norwich, Blackburn 1-0 QPR – as it happened","trailText":"Romaine Sawyers’s winner, a red for Grant Hanley and an injury to Teemu Pukki made an unhappy Championship return for Norwich","byline":"John Brewin","body":"<div id=\"block-62e5656f8f08c00147327ae9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-30T17:08:35.426Z\">6.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here’s today’s Championship roundup.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/championship-roundup-lewis-travis-strike-gives-blackburn-winning-start\">Championship roundup: Lewis Travis strike gives Blackburn winning start</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62e5577e8f08730a1f7f451a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-30T16:13:40.881Z\">5.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It’s back, and it was as unpredictable as ever</strong>, with Norwich losing to Cardiff, and then losing their captain in Grant Hanley to a second yellow and talisman Teemu Pukki to injury.

If his claim is true, he could be seen to have made a hugely consequential intervention in modern US history.</p> <p>Murdoch’s support, chiefly through Fox News, did much to boost Trump to victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/19/landslide-michael-wolff-rupert-murdoch-donald-trump-fox-news\">persistent reports</a> of friction between the two men, Murdoch supported Trump through four tumultuous years in power which culminated in Trump’s refusal to admit defeat and the deadly attack on Congress.</p> <p>The Guardian obtained a copy of Kushner’s book, which will be published next month.</p> <p>The book lands at a time when Murdoch’s newspapers and to some extent Fox News are widely seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/25/new-york-post-trump-murdoch-wall-street-journal-fox-news\">to be pulling away from Trump</a>, amid congressional hearings into his election subversion and the January 6 attack, speculation about criminal charges and as he prepares another White House run.</p> <p>In his book, Trump’s son-in-law, who became a senior White House adviser, describes a friendship with Murdoch built on time on Murdoch’s yacht and at Bono’s house in France, watching the U2 frontman sing with Bob Geldof and Billy Joel. Kushner also describes how Wendi Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch’s third wife, helped get him back with Ivanka Trump after a breakup.</p> <p>Kushner claims to have convinced Murdoch to support Trump in 2015.</p> <p>Trump and Murdoch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/19/landslide-michael-wolff-rupert-murdoch-donald-trump-fox-news\">were not close</a> before Trump entered politics. But in July 2015, after Trump launched his explosive campaign for the Republican presidential nomination with a racist rant about Mexicans, the Fox News owner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/622558129742573568\">tweeted</a>: “When is Donald Trump going to stop embarrassing the whole country?”</p> <p>A week later, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/us/politics/titans-clash-as-donald-trumps-run-fuels-his-feud-with-rupert-murdoch.html\">described</a> Murdoch disparaging Trump. Trump was furious and threatened to tweet. Kushner was not then an official adviser to his father-in-law but he writes: “I called Rupert and told him I had to see him.</p> <p>“‘Rupert, I think he could win,’ I said, as we sat in his office. ‘You guys agree on a lot of the issues. You want smaller government. You want lower taxes. You want stronger borders.’</p> <p>“Rupert listened quizzically, like he couldn’t imagine that Trump was actually serious about running. The next day, he called me and said, ‘I’ve looked at this and maybe I was misjudging it. He actually does have a real following. It does seem like he’s very popular, like he can really be a kingmaker in the Republican primary with the way he is playing it. What does Donald want?’</p> <p>“‘He wants to be president,’ I responded.</p> <p>“‘No, what does he really want?’ he asked again.</p> <p>“‘Look, he doesn’t need a nicer plane,’ I said. ‘He’s got a beautiful plane. He doesn’t need a nicer house. He doesn’t need anything. He’s tired of watching politicians screw up the country, and he thinks he could do a better job.’</p> <p>“‘Interesting,’ Rupert said.</p> <p>“We had a truce, for the time being.”</p> <p>Kushner also writes about Trump’s clashes with Fox News during the 2016 campaign, including a clash with the anchor Megyn Kelly. Kushner says he agreed a deal with Roger Ailes, then in charge of Fox News, for a donation of $5m to a veterans’ organisation of Trump’s choice, in return for Trump choosing not to skip a debate.</p> <p>Murdoch rejected the deal, Kushner writes, saying if he took it he would have to “pay everyone to show up to debates”.</p> <p>Kushner also describes how Murdoch helped shape his view of why the US needed Trump. At a rally in Springfield, Illinois in November 2015, Kushner was reminded “of a book that Rupert Murdoch had given me months earlier: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/books/review/charles-murray-examines-the-white-working-class-in-coming-apart.html\">Charles Murray’s Coming Apart</a>, which makes a case that over the last 50 years America has divided into upper and lower classes that live apart from each other, geographically and culturally”.</p> <p>Trump, Kushner writes, appealed to the “forgotten and disenfranchised”. For his son-in-law rally in Illinois “was a wake-up call”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/25/new-york-post-trump-murdoch-wall-street-journal-fox-news\">Is Murdoch tiring of Trump?

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/11/rspb-calls-for-new-laws-on-game-bird-shooting\" title=\"\">RSPB says that birds of prey are killed illegally</a> to protect game birds. It also objects to the use of poisonous lead ammunition, which the government is considering outlawing.</p> <p>This year’s dramatic reduction in game birds will also affect beaters, catering companies and restaurants, Boulton said, adding that 75% of rural land is managed for shooting of some type including game, and the industry is worth about £2.4bn.</p> <p>The initial signs of disruption came at the end of February when the first case of bird flu was discovered in the Loire valley. “Roughly half of the birds that we rear in this country originate from an egg laid in France,” Boulton said, estimating that about 90% of partridges and 40% of pheasants come from producers, with “virtually all” in the Loire valley.</p> <p>After avian flu is detected on a farm, the birds are culled and 30 days later the farmer can start trading birds domestically – which for French farmers means within the EU. But international exports must wait for 90 days, under World Organisation for Animal Health guidelines adopted into UK and EU law.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nationalgamekeepers.org.uk/#EVENTS.LISTING.CAROUSEL\" title=\"\">National Gamekeepers’ Organisation</a> (NGO) campaigned for the government to create special licences allowing imports before the 90 days were up. After weeks of negotiations, ministers reached an agreement with the EU for a “bespoke arrangement”, but not France.</p> <p>“Even if we were still in the EU and operating under the 30-day rule, we would still have been in trouble,” Boulton said, adding that French officials had created false hope among shooters that imports might restart in time. “If you want to start shooting on 1 October [when the pheasant season begins], your birds need to be eight weeks old by the end of June when they can be released into the wild.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c41894d58eb5c74dd76f0de6df68628fedaf348\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c41894d58eb5c74dd76f0de6df68628fedaf348/0_745_3543_4570/775.jpg\" alt=\"Pheasants \" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Forty percent of pheasants come from producers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: blickwinkel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The last outbreak in France was detected on 17 May and 16 million farmed birds, including poultry, were culled. By 22 June, there had been 1,464 bird flu cases, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).</p> <p>French farmers have been devastated. Otto Tepasse founded his central London restaurant, Otto’s, on traditional French cuisine. Canard à la Presse is his signature dish, made with Challans ducks from the Maison Burgaud farm in the Loire.</p> <p>“I have not been serving any duck since it started,” he said. “This farm has been in business since the 1930s and they are the main farm for three-star Michelin restaurants. Now everything has been wiped out.”</p> <p>The farm was given the all-clear only in mid-July, he said, but they are now trying to find new stock. Diners will have to wait until the end of September before they can eat his pressed duck again.</p> <p>Bird flu has been reported in 35 European countries in 2022, and the UK saw a near fivefold increase in cases to 122 so far this year.</p> <p>Free-range eggs were unavailable for five weeks because the outbreaks meant that British chickens had to be kept inside, and last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/bird-flu-rise-are-chickens-in-back-garden-to-blame\" title=\"\">Defra established a research consortium</a> led by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) to investigate how to prevent the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Outbreaks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/20/avian-flu-h5n1-wreaks-devastation-seabirds-aoe\" title=\"\">killed thousands of seabirds</a> in the Farne Islands off the coast ofNorthumberland earlier this month, and thousands more gannets, gulls and puffins across Scotland, leading to a ban on visitors to 23 Scottish islands.</p> <p>The virus spreads from wild birds to captive ones, possibly through droppings and direct contact. One theory of how the virus circulates is that the birds that migrate to the Arctic during the summer then pass it to each other. Birds also mix in central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan on migration routes.</p> <p>The NGO said it was too early to say how the shooting season would be affected, but its chairman, David Pooler, was pleased with how the government had acted. “We have been assured that the government is trying to put in place measures which would prevent similar incidents from happening again in future.”</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said the department had tried to balance the egg trade with the country’s “high standards of biosecurity following this year’s avian influenza outbreak. Unfortunately, due to a range of external factors, it was not possible to put measures in place in time for this year’s shooting season. We are aware this will have an impact, and we are exploring how we can alleviate these pressures going forward.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/30/share-your-thoughts-on-the-final-episode-of-neighbours","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T16:05:16Z","webTitle":"Share your thoughts on the final episode of Neighbours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/30/share-your-thoughts-on-the-final-episode-of-neighbours","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/30/share-your-thoughts-on-the-final-episode-of-neighbours","fields":{"headline":"Share your thoughts on the final episode of Neighbours","trailText":"We’d like to hear about your views on the finale after 37 years of the soap being on air","byline":"Guardian community team","body":"<p>After 37 years of non-stop drama, Australia’s beloved soap Neighbours came to an end on Friday night.</p> <p>Fans said goodbye to Erinsborough and the cast on Ramsay Street after almost four decades on air.</p> <p>We’d like to hear from readers about what they made of the finale of Australia’s longest-running TV drama.

One such delight this year was <strong><a href=\"https://mediastormpodcast.com/\">Media Storm</a></strong><a href=\"https://mediastormpodcast.com/\">,</a> hosted by Mathilda Mallinson and Helena Wadia, which won gold for best current affairs podcast. It looks at news from the point of view of those who are central to the stories but don’t often get to speak; Mallinson and Wadia started it after they noticed that reports about migrants rarely featured any actual migrants. The journalism is excellent, thorough and empathic, and they both have a great knack for revealing questions. If you’re new to it, you might want to start a few shows back, as the most recent episode isn’t representative: choose from <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/lu/podcast/1-8-the-uks-war-on-drugs-politics-and-prohibition/id1592553644?i=1000552080058\">drug legislation</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/lu/podcast/bonus-episode-a-decriminalised-future-for-sex-work/id1592553644?i=1000554333154\">sex worker laws</a>, even treatment for <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/lu/podcast/2-1-gender-health-gaps-the-true-cost-of-chronic/id1592553644?i=1000567460607\">chronic UTIs</a> (revelatory).</p> <p>The latest episode concerns <a href=\"https://mediastormpodcast.com/episodes/episode/?episode=27\">non-offending paedophiles</a>: people who are sexually attracted to children and young teens but who don’t act on this attraction. (So: fairly obvious trigger warning.) Mallinson goes to Germany to talk to a psychotherapist who set up a clinic in 2005 to help non-offending paedophiles control their behaviour. He explains that humans develop their sexual orientation at around 14 and don’t grow out of it, whatever it may be. She talks to others, including a celibate female paedophile and a man who realised he was attracted to children when he himself was very young, so turned to the internet for support and was exploited. An enormously challenging subject, well handled by Mallinson, deeply questioned by Wadia. I have been thinking about the episode ever since I listened.</p> <p>Another BPA winner was <strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7ANleZqybunjuN4SfjA20k\">Decode</a></strong>, Spotify’s British version of the US hit show <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2b025hq3gJ17tQdxS3aV43\">Dissect</a></em>. This takes an album and goes through it track by track, unpicking the lyrics and music, contextualising the artist’s history. So far, the decoders have tackled Dave’s <em>Psychodrama</em> and Skepta’s <em>Konnichiwa</em>, both albums that merit intense examination (I loved the episode on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7JQ0DJ7LAwrvtmXkaF2AzO\">Skepta’s Shutdown</a>). It’s a reassuringly nerdy programme, occasionally slightly pompous, but informed and nicely produced, and the host, poet Kayo Chingonyi, is a lovely listen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df606d37ee9367c3cbe76f11d3532eeaaf2b4043\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df606d37ee9367c3cbe76f11d3532eeaaf2b4043/622_38_4954_2972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kayo Chingonyi presents Decode\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kayo Chingonyi, presenter of Decode, which analyses an album track by track: ‘a lovely listen’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If that’s your kind of thing, here are two brand new music analysis shows. <strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/nz/podcast/songbook/id1634425283\">Songbook</a></strong> is hosted by music journalist and pop culture expert Jude Rogers, whose work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juderogers\">is often in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juderogers\">Observer</a></em>. It’s an interview show that, each week, discusses a book about music. Later episodes promise Vashti Bunyan and Adelle Stripe (the series will feature more women than men, unusually), but the opener has Suede’s <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/nz/podcast/01-brett-anderson/id1634425283?i=1000570648831\">Brett Anderson chatting</a>, with his usual wit and intelligence, about <em>Starlust</em>, which features fans’ musings on their beloved stars. “It was mundane in places,” he says, “which I quite liked.”</p> <p>And here is <strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3RTdjYwNHu3DTZO3lLxLCf\">We Miss Amy Winehouse</a></strong>, from comedian <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/i-miss-amy-winehouse\">Suchandrika Chakrabarti</a>. She’s an engaging audio presence, good at emotional reactions though a little woolly when it comes to analysis (Back to Black doesn’t sound like a funeral march until the end!). We get to hear the entirety of the tracks mentioned, which is an utter joy. With both shows, I’d be happier with a tougher edit, but that’s just me.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0ckffkw\">The Museum of Bad Vibes</a></strong> is another interesting new show, emerging from BBC Sounds’ <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p09jk03g\">Audio Lab</a>, a scheme to help new podcast creators. In each episode, host Hanna Adan (excellent) examines a different museum artefact. The origin of each object is far from the UK, but they now live in British museums, on display or – more upsettingly – in a box, away from view. Some of these artefacts were designed to be actively worshipped or are from a culture that believes that they are a living presence. Adan’s script is great, the discussion about repatriation fascinating, and the voicing of the objects’ feelings is far less irritating than you might fear. This one could be up for an award next year.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/30/george-russell-claims-first-pole-of-his-career-at-hungarian-grand-prix","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T15:53:47Z","webTitle":"George Russell claims first pole of his career at Hungarian Grand Prix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/george-russell-claims-first-pole-of-his-career-at-hungarian-grand-prix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/30/george-russell-claims-first-pole-of-his-career-at-hungarian-grand-prix","fields":{"headline":"George Russell claims first pole of his career at Hungarian Grand Prix","trailText":"The Mercedes driver was quicker than Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc, while Championship leader Max Verstappen was 10th after losing power","byline":"Giles Richards at the Hungaroring","body":"<p>Good times have been in short supply at Mercedes this season. The team’s poorly performing car has left them stoically having to grin and bear it. In qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix and out of the blue, they finally had the chance to just grin as a good time came to them in George Russell delivering an extraordinary lap to take his first Formula One pole position and Mercedes’ first of the season.</p> <p>There was elation in the Mercedes garage at the Hungaroring as mechanics and engineers who have been under the cosh all season were finally able to enjoy the adrenaline surge of success once more. While Russell, the 24-year-old who is always careful to keep a tight rein on his emotions, was lit up with pleasure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/29/vettels-activism-defined-latter-years-but-talent-burned-brightest-on-track\">Vettel’s activism defined latter years but talent burned brightest on track | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is what racing is about,” he said. “Why I wake up every single day because feelings like this are something you can’t really dream of.”</p> <p>Nicknamed Mr Saturday for his skill over the single lap in qualifying while in an underperforming car at Williams, Russell will surely find the moniker all but impossible to shake off in future.</p> <p>The scale of his achievement cannot be overestimated. His car has been down on pace all season and he had looked to be more than half a second back on the leaders at best. As late as last night he and the team were still furiously searching for ways to bring it up to speed. Yet with so little preparation when it mattered Russell threw it round the Hungaroring with an abandon that was breathtaking then paid tribute to his team.</p> <p>“Yesterday was probably our toughest Friday of the whole season,” he said. “We were all here until 11pm last night scratching our heads, morale was pretty down and we felt pretty lost. To come back and grab pole position 24 hours later, it’s just such a feeling because I know what we went through last night. There’s no points for qualifying but getting this result for all of us is pretty huge.”</p> <p>A technically challenging circuit with a preponderance of medium and slow-speed corners, the Hungaroring has to be managed with absolute precision. This has then been Russell’s teammate Lewis Hamilton’s fiefdom, with a record eight poles here. Yet he could manage only seventh place on Saturday as his heir apparent flew. Russell’s talent has never been in doubt, here with every flick of the wheel it was writ large as Hamilton acknowledged.</p> <p>“Huge congratulations to George,” he said. “It’s an amazing feeling to get the first pole position and it is huge for the team, we don’t know where the pace all of a sudden came from, it came from nowhere, that’s a huge positive. He should be able to win from that position at this track.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"709031c5157753a47f997cf7ed71575842d6f21b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/709031c5157753a47f997cf7ed71575842d6f21b/846_575_2802_1682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Russell drives during the qualifying session ahead of the Formula One Hungarian Grand Prix at the Hungaroring\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Russell was nicknamed Mr Saturday for his skill over the single lap in qualifying while in an underperforming car at Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Bruna/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lap was the best of his four-year career, one that included an outstanding second on the grid in the wet at Spa for Williams. Yet it had to be to squeeze Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc into second and third, albeit while the championship leader, Max Verstappen, had a poor afternoon, his Red Bull losing power on his final lap and finishing 10th. On this form, Russell would have the measure of the Dutchman regardless.</p> <p>The Mercedes this season is a mercurial car, difficult to setup, to balance and with a narrow operating window where it performs at its best. In Budapest they and Russell found it.

Appearing in the shops this week, it will be perused by sweltering customers who have just endured record high temperatures across the UK and now face the prospect of weeks of drought to add to their discomfort.</p> \n<p>And this is just the beginning, insists McGuire, who is emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London. As he makes clear in his uncompromising depiction of the coming climatic catastrophe, we have – for far too long – ignored explicit warnings that rising carbon emissions are dangerously heating the Earth. Now we are going to pay the price for our complacency in the form of storms, floods, droughts and heatwaves that will easily surpass current extremes.</p> \n<p>The crucial point, he argues, is that there is now no chance of us avoiding a perilous, all-pervasive climate breakdown. We have passed the point of no return and can expect a future in which lethal heatwaves and temperatures in excess of 50C (120F) are common in the tropics; where summers at temperate latitudes will invariably be baking hot, and where our oceans are destined to become warm and acidic. “A child born in 2020 will face a far more hostile world that its grandparents did,” McGuire insists.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"678900193ad42dc2b6c89d105b99ac33fe7dd386\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/678900193ad42dc2b6c89d105b99ac33fe7dd386/1322_517_1488_1860/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bill McGuire.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill McGuire is emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London and was also an adviser to the UK government.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sent by him</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In this respect, the volcanologist, who was also a member of the UK government’s Natural Hazard Working Group, takes an extreme position. Most other climate experts still maintain we have time left, although not very much, to bring about meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. A rapid drive to net zero and the halting of global warming is still within our grasp, they say.</p> \n<p>Such claims are dismissed by McGuire. “I know a lot of people working in climate science who say one thing in public but a very different thing in private. In confidence, they are all much more scared about the future we face, but they won’t admit that in public. I call this climate appeasement and I believe it only makes things worse. The world needs to know how bad things are going to get before we can hope to start to tackle the crisis.”</p> \n<p>McGuire finished writing <em>Hothouse Earth</em> at the end of 2021. He includes many of the record high temperatures that had just afflicted the planet, including extremes that had struck the UK. A few months after he completed his manuscript, and as publication loomed, he found that many of those records had already been broken. “That is the trouble with writing a book about climate breakdown,” says McGuire. “By the time it is published it is already out of date. That is how fast things are moving.”</p> \n<p>Among the records broken during the book’s editing was the announcement that a temperature of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/19/a-wake-up-call-as-extreme-heat-blazes-across-uk-experts-say-net-zero-is-the-only-way-out#:~:text=Storms%20threaten%20more%20disruption%20on%20heels%20of%20record%2Dbreaking%20UK%20heat,-After%20temperatures%20reached&amp;text=Hundreds%20of%20firefighters%20battled%20blazes,call%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20climate%20emergency.\" title=\"\">40.3C was reached in east England on 19 July</a>, the highest ever recorded in the UK. (The country’s previous hottest temperature, 38.7C, was in Cambridge in 2019.)</p> \n<p>In addition, London’s fire service had to tackle blazes across the capital, with one conflagration destroying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/uk-cities-need-to-prepare-for-future-wildfires-say-fire-chiefs\" title=\"\">16 homes in Wennington, east London</a>. Crews there had to fight to save the local fire station itself. “Who would have thought that a village on the edge of London would be almost wiped out by wildfires in 2022,” says McGuire. “If this country needs a wake-up call then surely that is it.”</p> \n<p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires\" title=\"\">Wildfires of unprecedented intensity and ferocity</a> have also swept across Europe, North America and Australia this year, while record rainfall in the midwest led to the devastating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/13/yellowstone-national-park-closure-flooding-mudslides\" title=\"\">flooding in the US’s Yellowstone national park</a>. “And as we head further into 2022, it is already a different world out there,” he adds. “Soon it will be unrecognisable to every one of us.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0600f3f23e6d84ecd8302d8f6707d5362b5803cb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0600f3f23e6d84ecd8302d8f6707d5362b5803cb/0_247_5357_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurdish farmers battle a blaze in a wheat field in Syria’s north-eastern Hasakah province, a breadbasket for the region.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kurdish farmers battle a blaze in a wheat field in Syria’s north-eastern Hasakah province, a breadbasket for the region.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These changes underline one of the most startling aspects of climate breakdown: the speed with which global average temperature rises translate into extreme weather.</p> \n<p>“Just look at what is happening already to a world which has only heated up by just over one degree,” says McGuire. “It turns out the climate is changing for the worse far quicker than predicted by early climate models. That’s something that was never expected.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d98f877a-9c79-490f-9023-2d86e8a1f31a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RVcsV_-erys?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, when humanity began pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, global temperatures have risen by just over 1C. At the Cop26 climate meeting in Glasgow last year, it was agreed that every effort should be made to try to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/13/cop26-the-goal-of-15c-of-climate-heating-is-alive-but-only-just\" title=\"\">limit that rise to 1.5C</a>, although to achieve such a goal, it was calculated that global carbon emissions will have to be reduced by 45% by 2030.</p> \n<p>“In the real world, that is not going to happen,” says McGuire. “Instead, we are on course for close to a 14% rise in emissions by that date – which will almost certainly see us shatter the 1.5C guardrail in less than a decade.”</p> \n<p>And we should be in no doubt about the consequences. Anything above 1.5C will see a world plagued by intense summer heat, extreme drought, devastating floods, reduced crop yields, rapidly melting ice sheets and surging sea levels. A rise of 2C and above will seriously threaten the stability of global society, McGuire argues. It should also be noted that according to the most hopeful estimates of emission cut pledges made at Cop26, the world is on course to heat up by between 2.4C and 3C.</p> \n<p>From this perspective it is clear we can do little to avoid the coming climate breakdown. Instead we need to adapt to the hothouse world that lies ahead and to start taking action to try to stop a bleak situation deteriorating even further, McGuire says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb7a7e187cd208a7efe3f87552633d72922dad18\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb7a7e187cd208a7efe3f87552633d72922dad18/0_174_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Fox Glacier in New Zealand in winter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Fox glacier in New Zealand in winter.

Heatwaves will become more frequent, get hotter and last longer. Huge numbers of modern, tiny, poorly insulated UK homes will become heat traps, responsible for thousands of deaths every summer by 2050.</p> \n<p>“Despite repeated warnings, hundreds of thousands of these inappropriate homes continue to be built every year,” adds McGuire.</p> \n<p>As to the reason for the world’s tragically tardy response, McGuire blames a “conspiracy of ignorance, inertia, poor governance, and obfuscation and lies by climate change deniers that has ensured that we have sleepwalked to within less than half a degree of the dangerous 1.5C climate change guardrail. Soon, barring some sort of miracle, we will crash through it.”</p> \n<p>The future is forbidding from this perspective, though McGuire stresses that if carbon emissions can be cut substantially in the near future, and if we start to adapt to a much hotter world today, a truly calamitous and unsustainable future can be avoided. The days ahead will be grimmer, but not disastrous. We may not be able to give climate breakdown the slip but we can head off further instalments that would appear as a climate cataclysm bad enough to threaten the very survival of human civilisation.</p> \n<p>“This is a call to arms,” he says. “So if you feel the need to glue yourself to a motorway or blockade an oil refinery, do it. Drive an electric car or, even better, use public transport, walk or cycle. Switch to a green energy tariff; eat less meat. Stop flying; lobby your elected representatives at both local and national level; and use your vote wisely to put in power a government that walks the talk on the climate emergency.”</p> \n<p><em>Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant’s Guide</em> by Bill McGuire is published by Icon Books, £9.99</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f77ab78e2c6b53bbe44733f241e467f2579effa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f77ab78e2c6b53bbe44733f241e467f2579effa/54_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Gulf Stream is seen on map showing sea surface temperature\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gulf Stream, starting in the Gulf of Mexico and running through the Atlantic Ocean, is being weakened by climate breakdown.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NOAA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>• The headline of this article was amended on 2 August 2022 to more accurately reflect the concern expressed by Bill McGuire.

Hopkins set up the company in 2012 as a spinout from the University of Dundee, where he was by then working as a professor. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which are being trained to mimic human creativity, to develop new medicines.

Hopkins’s stake of nearly 16% is now worth £170m, as the share price has lost 60% of its value in a bloodbath for Wall Street stocks.</p> <p>Exscientia was part of a transatlantic trend that is defying government attempts to build a biotech powerhouse in the UK. Abcam, a pioneering Cambridge antibody company, recently announced it was moving its stock market listing from the UK to the US. “We are a British company; we choose to be in Oxford because we can attract global talent,” Hopkins says. “But to be seen as a global company, we listed on what is the global technology index, which is Nasdaq. What we have now is an incredibly international shareholder base from across the world.”</p> <p>The business came up with the first AI-designed drug to enter clinical trials – a treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder in partnership with Japan’s Sumitomo, although Sumitomo later decided not to proceed with it. The Japanese firm is currently studying another drug developed by Exscientia, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease psychosis, in early human trials.</p> <p>Hopkins, now 50, fell in love with science thanks to an inspirational chemistry teacher. He has worked as a scientist since the age of 16, when he did a stint in industrial chemistry at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, which he says taught him about the benefits of automation in boosting productivity.</p> <p>He spent nearly a decade at the US drug giant Pfizer, where he was on a “data warehouse” project that led to some of the first machine-learning applications in the pharmaceutical industry, with the findings <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1228\" title=\"\">published in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1228\" title=\"\">Nature</a></em> in 2006.</p> <p>During the subsequent five years at Dundee University, he further researched applying data mining and machine learning to drug discovery. He says “being a professor is actually one of the best jobs in the world” and gave him the freedom to research AI methods at length. He maintains his links with the university, where he is honorary chair of medicinal informatics at the School of Life Sciences.</p> <p>Exscientia (which means “from knowledge” in Latin) soon moved to the Schrödinger Building at the Oxford science park, and now employs 450 people worldwide, from Vienna to Boston, Miami and Osaka, equally split between AI engineering, chemistry and biology.</p> <p>It is building a new robotics laboratory at Milton Park near Oxford, focused on the automation of chemistry and biology to accelerate drug development and its declared goal is “drugs designed by AI, made by robot”. Other pharma companies have also introduced some automation into their processes, but generally lab technology is similar to how it was when he was a student in the 1990s, Hopkins says.</p> <p>The firm is involved in 30 projects, some in partnership with big pharmaceutical companies including France’s Sanofi and the US firm Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS). It is also working with Oxford University on developing medicines that target neuroinflammation for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Among the firm’s solo projects, a cancer drug for solid tumours is about to go into early clinical trials.</p> <p>Exscientia is also working on a broader coronavirus pill to rival Paxlovid, the Covid-19 treatment made by Hopkins’s former employer Pfizer.

The firm is aiming for a low-cost pill that could be distributed globally and given quickly to people who fall ill to prevent serious illness and hospitalisation.

While you can use bottled lime juice in other drinks, the oils from the fresh lime skins are crucial to mojitos of any kind.</p> <p>Prep <strong>5 min<br></strong>Makes <strong>About 800ml</strong></p> <p><strong>½ cucumber</strong>, peeled and diced<br><strong>4 limes</strong>, halved and juiced, spent skins reserved<br><strong>50g caster sugar<br>500ml coconut water<br>1 generous handful mint leaves</strong></p> <p>In a large jug, use a stick blender to reduce the cucumber, lime juice and sugar to juice, then stir in the coconut water. Divide the lime skins and mint between four glasses, then use a wooden spoon to muddle (ie, semi-enthusiastically encourage) the flavours and scent from both. Add a good handful of crushed ice to each glass, fill with the cucumber-coconut water and serve.</p> <h2>Watermelon fizz</h2> <p>I know this sounds like a cheese-and-banana sandwich of a combination, but I promise the bitterness of the tonic makes everything sit up straight. These quantities make way too much spicy sugar, but you need a certain amount to make it grind well, it keeps for ever and it’s amazing on hot buttered toast.</p> <p>Prep <strong>10 min<br></strong>Makes <strong>About 900ml, undiluted</strong></p> <p><strong>8 cardamom pods</strong>, seeds only<br><strong>1 generous blade mace<br>5 Sichuan peppercorns<br>8 tbsp white caster sugar<br>2 tbsp sea salt<br>½ watermelon</strong>, cold from the fridge<br><strong>Juice of 1 red grapefruit<br>4 tbsp fresh lime juice</strong> (from about 2 limes – keep the skins)<br><strong>Tonic water</strong>, to top</p> <p>Put the spices and sugar in a spice or coffee grinder and reduce to a fairly fine dust. Combine with the salt and scatter a little on to a saucer.</p> <p>Scoop the watermelon flesh into a blender and blitz smooth. Sieve into a jug, using a spoon to encourage the juice to run through, then stir in the grapefruit and lime juice.</p> <p>Run a piece of lime around the rim of each glass, then dip the rim into the spicy sugar. Half-fill the glass with watermelon juice, then dilute with tonic water to taste.</p> <h2>Nectarine and Earl Grey iced tea</h2> <p>The sweetness of the fruit and gentle floral tea work beautifully together, but do also try this with a generous dash of lime juice, and/or ease it back with sparkling water. The syrup keeps for a week and the tea loses brightness after a couple of days, so keep them separate if you’re not using them all up immediately.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min<br></strong>Chill <strong>1 hr<br></strong>Makes <strong>About 1.2 litres</strong></p> <p><strong>3 Earl Grey teabags<br>4 ripe nectarines</strong>, halved, stoned and roughly chopped<strong><br>230g granulated sugar</strong><br><strong>Sparkling water</strong>, to dilute (optional)</p> <p>Put the teabags in a jug, pour over 800ml boiling water, leave to infuse for five minutes, then lift out and discard the teabags.</p> <p>In a medium pan, bring the nectarines, sugar and 100ml water to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cook for about 15 minutes, until soft, then blend (a stick blender is ideal) smooth. Stir the syrup into the tea jug, leave to cool, then refrigerate.</p> <p>Serve in tall glasses with plenty of ice, diluted with sparkling water, if you prefer.</p> <h2>Kiwi and tarragon lemonade</h2> <p>Kiwi’s bright, bold sweet/sharpness pairs perfectly with tarragon’s gentle aniseed and lemon’s sourness. Lemon thyme instead of the tarragon is a great variation.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min<br></strong>Makes <strong>About 1 litre when diluted</strong></p> <p><strong>250g sugar<br>20g tarragon leaves<br>6 lemons</strong>, zest cut into strips, then juiced<br><strong>6 ripe kiwifruit</strong>, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>Sparkling water</strong>, to dilute</p> <p>Put the sugar in a medium bowl, add 250ml boiling water and stir until dissolved. Add the tarragon and lemon zest, leave to infuse for 10 minutes, or for longer if you prefer a stronger taste, then remove and discard the tarragon and zest.</p> <p>Use a stick blender to blitz the kiwi and lemon juice smooth, then stir in the tarragon syrup. Dilute to taste with three or four parts sparkling water.</p> <h2>Raspberry and lemon thyme switchel</h2> <p>The classic switchel of honey, lemon and ginger in vinegar became a popular workplace refresher in 1800s America, when it was also known as Haymaker’s Punch, but you don’t have to work up a sweat to enjoy this. Use it as blueprint for your own variations.</p> <p>Prep <strong>10 min<br></strong>Infuse<strong> Overnight<br></strong>Makes <strong>1 litre<br><br>20g fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>3 tbsp honey</strong><br><strong>2 tsp lemon juice<br>70ml cider vinegar<br>1 big handful raspberries<br>10cm sprig lemon thyme</strong></p> <p>Put the ginger, honey, lemon and vinegar in a clean one-litre jar and stir to dissolve the honey. Add the raspberries, squeezing them slightly, then fill 3cm from the top with water. Seal, then leave to infuse overnight.</p> <p>Next day, add the sprig of lemon thyme to the jar, seal again, leave to infuse for four or so hours, then refrigerate. Pour through a sieve when you want to drink it. This switchel is wonderful as it is, on the rocks, or with gin.</p> <h2>Strawberry, elderflower and passionfruit smash</h2> <p>Whatever time of year you make this, it tastes of early summer. As with all these cocktails, adjust to suit whatever fruit you have to hand: blueberries, raspberries or pineapple work equally well, here. And try a bashed lemongrass stalk instead of the rosemary.</p> <p>Prep <strong>5 min <br></strong>Serves <strong>1</strong></p> <p><strong>4 large strawberries</strong>, hulled and chopped<br><strong>½ lemon</strong>, zest cut off in strips, then juiced<br><strong>Juice and seeds of ½ passion fruit<br>20ml elderflower cordial<br>90ml ginger beer</strong><br><strong>90ml sparkling water<br>12cm sprig rosemary</strong></p> <p>Using a wooden spoon, gently squish the strawberries and lemon zest in the bottom of a tall glass. Add the passion fruit juice and seeds, elderflower cordial and lemon juice. Add a few ice cubes, then pour in the ginger beer and sparkling water. Clap the rosemary between your hands to encourage the flavour and scent to release, then use it to stir the contents of the glass, drop it in and serve.</p> <ul> <li><p>Mark Diacono’s latest book, Ferment: Slow Down, Make Food to Last, is published by Quadrille at £12.99.

Drummer <a href=\"http://www.davebarry.co.uk/\">Dave Barry</a> was booked for a recording session that was cancelled. He had wanted to record with saxophonist Art Themen for some time and grabbed the cancelled date. Themen was free, and so were their first choices, pianist Gareth Williams and bassist Dave Green. This is the result. The eight tracks are a mixture of numbers composed by jazz musicians and a few old songs that have drifted into the jazz repertoire, but here the treatment is looser and more inventive than the usual parade of solos. We often hear just piano and bass, for instance, or saxophone and piano.</p> <p>The variety, not only of sound but of atmosphere and mood, is remarkable. The title piece, by Dexter Gordon, has Themen buzzing about its simple melody like a mischievous bee, whereas Williams’s striking facility with time shows that it doesn’t have to be simple at all. Ellington’s Prelude to a Kiss manages to be effortlessly Ellingtonian without imitating him and, for me, is the best of a very good bunch.

Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/15/power-naps-and-big-steaks-meet-sarina-wiegman-new-england-women-head-coach\">arriving last autumn</a>, she has instilled confidence in the Lionesses that has led to a 19-game unbeaten run, winning 17 and scoring 104 goals. Tactically astute and not afraid to stick to her guns, she has proven her ability to change the course of a game with a substitution. In addition, she has won this competition before, guiding her native <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/06/womens-euro-2017-holland-denmark-match-report\">Netherlands to the 2017 Euros title</a>. Having the results to back up her instructions can only help in getting players on board.</p> <h2>Role of the squad</h2> <p>Depth in a tournament is crucial and England possess this in abundance. Each of the 23 play professionally with all but one playing regularly in the Women’s Super League last season – Rachel Daly plays for Houston Dash in the US’s National Women’s Soccer League. They have spent significant time on the pitch, gaining vital experience. Wiegman rarely changes her starting lineup – she has named the same 11 for every match this tournament – but her utilisation of the bench has been key. Her finishing players play an integral role, whether making an impact in front of goal or adding cover to help them see out a game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a622b792283d2fee3934ee60f51fed4adeb660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a622b792283d2fee3934ee60f51fed4adeb660/0_177_4179_2507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ella Toone (left) has been key off the bench for England as Sarina Wiegman’s finishing players have made their mark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ella Toone (left) has been key off the bench for England as Sarina Wiegman’s finishing players have made their mark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Strong youth pathway</h2> <p>England are reaping the rewards of a strong youth system. Five of the Lionesses have played together since a young age. Alessia Russo, Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone, Ellie Roebuck and Lotte Wubben-Moy reached the quarter-finals of the 2016 Under-17 World Cup in Jordan before three of the five took home a bronze medal at the 2018 Under-20s edition, joined by Chloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp. Wubben-Moy missed out on that, while Toone was injured, but these tournaments have provided crucial development opportunities. There is a DNA that flows through English football. Mo Marley, who coached both of those age-group campaigns and has had an influence on so many Lionesses’ careers, has come out of retirement to spearhed an under-23s side, and Wiegman has ensured coaches across the pathway have input.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e20c68b4ec9ea5d31aa54db11ba8efa2a8df376\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e20c68b4ec9ea5d31aa54db11ba8efa2a8df376/0_71_3235_1941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mo Marley (second left) was brought out of retirement to oversee England’s Under-23 side this year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mo Marley (second left) was brought out of retirement to oversee England’s Under-23 side this year, having helped bring many of the current senior crop through.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aitor Alcalde/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Pandemic delay</h2> <p>If any team has benefited from the year delay due to Covid, it has been England. A year ago, the Lionesses were a shadow of their former selves, without a permanent manager after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/18/phil-neville-steps-down-as-head-coach-of-england-women-with-immediate-effect\">the departure of Phil Neville</a> and having experienced declining results since the 2019 World Cup. The extra year, that has included competitive World Cup qualifiers, has allowed this squad to find their feet again and Wiegman to install her vision, while giving younger players an extended timeframe to bed themselves in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FA investment</h2> <p>The Football Association’s <a href=\"https://www.thefa.com/news/2017/mar/13/fa-womens-football-strategy-gameplan-for-growth-double-participation-130317\">Gameplan for Growth</a> from 2017-2020 provided strong foundations to create an environment for success. The first two targets to double participation and attendance were achieved and the goal for the success of the England team has seen them reach three successive semi-finals and now a major final in the timeframe targeted. The FA has backed women’s football, investing significantly in the Lionesses but also the domestic game. The professionalisation of the WSL, the sponsorship from companies such as Barclays, and the second-to-none support staff employed for the national side have all contributed.</p> <h2>Hosting this tournament</h2> <p>Hosting a major football competition can work both ways. It can substantially increase the pressure, particularly in a country so consumed by football. But it can also provide the vital support needed to give teams energy to get over the line. You only had to listen to the roar of the 28,994 in Brighton for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/20/england-spain-womens-euro-2022-quarter-final-match-report?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter\">quarter-final victory over Spain</a> to understand how much sold-out, partisan stadiums play a part.

It turned out to be an unusual problem: the Model S had lost a third of its battery range in an instant, while it was parked on a driveway.</p> <p>One of the US electric carmaker’s big selling points is that it is constantly connected to its vehicles via mobile networks, offering software updates and entertainment downloads “over the air”, or OTA. That remote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/13/robot-connected-cars-hacking-risks-driverless-vehicles-ross-now\" title=\"\">connection could be revolutionary for the industry</a>, opening the door for self-driving features to be downloaded and TV shows to be livestreamed in high definition. But the connected car is having teething problems.</p> <p>It was the second time engineers from Tesla had called one of Hughes’s customers after servicing to tell them they had corrected a “mistake” in the car’s setup. This time it had reset the vehicle to its original 60kWh range (about 215 miles), a big drop from the 90kWh (more than 300 miles) its battery was capable of following repairs under warranty a few years before. Tesla wanted $4,500 to change the car back to the longer range, in what has been labelled battery ransom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c51fdac863f0a3f5d1507e6c52b62548171f8cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c51fdac863f0a3f5d1507e6c52b62548171f8cb/344_0_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesla on dramatic road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new Tesla has a battery range of more than 300 miles – or can have.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“They were rightfully outraged,” said Hughes, owner of car servicing company 057 Technology, 60 miles from Charlotte, NC. “If it’s sitting in your driveway I don’t think anybody should be allowed to mess with that.”</p> <p>The manufacturer, which did not respond to a request for comment, eventually switched the car back to the longer range after Hughes posted about his experience on social media, but this is just the latest example of the unnerving control consumers must now cede to technology companies. What is given OTA can be taken away OTA.</p> <p>Tesla is by no means the only carmaker to have irked potential buyers with features (of the kind available at zero upfront cost on a smartphone) that can be withdrawn if you don’t pay your dues. Mercedes-Benz charges £19 a year for the ability to access a to-do list and calendar through the dashboard. Volkswagen charges £590 for the navigation upgrade for recent models. </p> <p>Those are software downloads, but a subscription-like “microtransaction” model is also creeping into cars’ hardware. BMW has started offering heated seats for £15 a month in the UK: the technology is installed but is usable only if paid for upfront or monthly. The revelation this month drew <a href=\"https://www.topgear.com/car-news/bmw-launches-heated-seat-and-steering-wheel-subscription-service-uk\" title=\"\">a barrage of incredulous news stories</a>.</p> <p>“The heated seats make everybody laugh, but there’s a logic to it,” said Philippe Houchois, auto analyst at investment bank Jefferies. It’s a way for carmakers to “try to get more recurring revenues and options from customers”.</p> <p>For Tesla, this model – similar to razor-and-razor blade subscription schemes – promises to be lucrative: at the end of June it claimed to have $2.7bn in “deferred revenues” tied to software upgrades on its books. Analysts expect that to grow as its autonomous driving software improves. By 2023, half of the top 10 carmakers will be offering unlocks and capability upgrades through software updates that drivers purchase after buying the vehicle, according to research firm Gartner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79ab7071ef27f1b9f072e801b0cf881876c19c76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79ab7071ef27f1b9f072e801b0cf881876c19c76/0_10_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iPhone 7\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple was fined for software that deliberately slowed down older iPhones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Régis Duvignau/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor are car owners the only consumers learning that software can be tricksy in a way hardware cannot. In 2017, Apple admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/24/apple-samsung-fined-for-slowing-down-phones\" title=\"\">its software was slowing down the performance of older iPhones</a>. It said that the design was aimed at saving battery life, but critics said it was an example of “planned obsolescence” – artificially shortening the life of a device to make buyers upgrade sooner. In 2009, Amazon provided a perfect metaphor for the potentially dystopian implications of the subscription economy when, without warning, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/17/amazon-kindle-1984\" title=\"\">revoked copies of George Orwell’s novel </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/17/amazon-kindle-1984\" title=\"\">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></em> from all its Kindle e-readers.</p> <p>Marketing information on<a href=\"https://www.bmw.co.uk/en/shop/ls/dp/ACC_Offer_gb\" title=\"\"> BMW’s online shop</a> suggest users also need to pay for potentially life-saving features such as automatic braking if a pedestrian steps into the road. In response to the <em>Observer</em>’s queries, the carmaker hurriedly said that the online description was incorrect, and the safety features were fitted as standard on all vehicles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It will be interesting to see how consumers respond to being charged to use hardware that has already been installed</p> <footer> <cite>Wasi Rivzi, analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But with more and more carmakers start charging for autonomous driving capabilities – which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/09/tesla-autopilot-crashes-investigation-nhtsa\" title=\"\">may or may not already be safer than much human driving</a> – the scenario of paywalled safety features is not totally farfetched. Insurers could then refuse to cover drivers who choose not to pay for tech that reduces accidents.</p> <p>BMW, which also tried in 2019 to persuade users to pay $80 a year for the privilege of linking iPhones through Apple CarPlay, claims the remote upgrades are a benefit to consumers. “It offers the opportunity to add selected features which they did not order when the vehicle was built,” said a spokesperson. “This is particularly useful for secondary owners, as they have the opportunity to add features that the original owner did not choose.”</p> <p>Then there is the manufacturing logic. Carmakers are very good at building tens or hundreds of thousands of identical products at high efficiency, but every tweak to the specification for different models costs money.

Here’s a story about the tech industry that illustrates the point.</p> <p>Act one begins in the spring of 1993, when Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina released the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)\">graphical browser</a> for the emerging world wide web. They called it Mosaic and it was a runaway success because it was the thing that enabled ordinary people to understand what this internet thingy was for. In 1994, Andreessen and Jim Clark set up a company that eventually became <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape\">Netscape</a> and in October that year released a new, improved browser called Netscape Navigator, which in three months had 75% of the nascent browser market. In August 1995, Netscape went public in a frenzied IPO that triggered the first internet boom.</p> <p>As their company thrived, Andreessen and co started to muse about an even brighter prospect. If web browsers really were the future, they reasoned, and since the operating system (OS) of a PC was effectively just a life-support system for a browser, who needed a complex and expensive OS such as Microsoft’s MS-DOS?</p> <p>At this point, Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder and CEO, woke up. For Microsoft’s core assets were its world-dominant OS and the Office software suite that ran on it. Accordingly, on 26 May 1995, he issued what came to be known as his <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2010/05/0526bill-gates-internet-memo/\">“Pearl Harbor” memo</a> to all staff about the “internet tidal wave” and how Netscape’s increasing dominance of it represented an existential threat for Microsoft. “One scary possibility being discussed by internet fans,” he wrote, “is whether they should get together and create something far less expensive than a PC which is powerful enough for web browsing.” His conclusion: Microsoft needed to turn on a dime to face the threat: “We need to move all of our internet value… into Windows 95 itself as soon as we possibly can with a major goal to get OEMs [ie PC manufacturers] shipping our browser preinstalled.”</p> <p>The clear aim was to destroy Netscape by giving all PC owners a free Microsoft browser built in and it succeeded. But it also nearly destroyed Microsoft, because it triggered an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.\">antitrust suit</a> that went within a hair’s breadth of breaking up the company.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Instagram is morphing from a photo platform to one that privileges short-form videos – just like TikTok</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For act two of our cautionary tale, we need to spool forward to the present. Meta (née<strong> </strong>Facebook) has enjoyed the same kind of global dominance in the field of social networking as Microsoft once had in the PC market. But now it seems to have twigged that it could be facing, if not an existential threat, then very serious problems.</p> <p>Of these, the biggest is probably TikTok, the Chinese-owned, video-hosting platform to which young users are stampeding from Instagram. But the list of other headaches is intimidating too. They include: the fact that Apple’s decision to enable iPhone users to turn off tracking has slashed Meta’s ability to profit from them; the plunge in Meta’s market cap <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/META/market_cap\">from $1.1tn to $450</a>bn (£375bn) in 10 months; quarterly profits are down for the second consecutive quarter; revenues likewise; the ballooning costs of Zuckerberg’s crackpot bet on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/10/exit-the-internet-enter-the-metaverse-your-online-future-is-in-3d\">metaverse</a> project (the hardware division of which apparently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/technology/zuckerberg-meta-facebook-earnings.html\">lost $3bn last quarter</a>); increasing interest from regulators and governments in Meta’s business practices; the persistent bad smell given off by Facebook’s incessant problems with privacy, toxic content and misinformation; and, to cap it all, there’s a global recession coming that is (rightly) obsessing the company’s CEO.</p> <p>There are signs that some of these problems are beginning to bite. Meta has dramatically reduced its recruitment of engineers – down from 10,000 a year to 6,000 – for example. And it’s been making panicky changes to core products. Instagram is morphing from a photo platform to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/26/instagram-changes-user-backlash-trying-to-be-tiktok\">one that privileges short-form videos</a> – just like TikTok. The older people who increasingly seem to constitute Facebook’s core users are now being offered two options for their news feeds: one a “discovery” tab that provides an algorithmically curated feed of items from all over the world, the other a chronological list of posts by their friends. Less dramatic (but perhaps more revealing) are small <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/technology/facebook-meta-perks.html\">changes to the perks</a> enjoyed by employees: no more free laundry or dry-cleaning services, for example. Or the fact that starting time for free dinners has been moved back from 6pm to 6:30pm!</p> <p>But perhaps the clinching clue that Mr Zuckerberg has reached his “Pearl Harbor” moment is the fact that he summoned Meta executives from all over the world to a rapidly organised meeting in San Francisco earlier this month. Before they turned up, they were required to read a discourse from their boss. But unlike the 5,584-word memo that Bill Gates used to wake up his colleagues, Zuckerberg’s executives had to sweat their way through a 122-page slide deck on “operating with increased intensity”. It’s almost enough to make one feel sorry for them.

","trailText":"MPs and charities are supporting a new billing structure featuring subsidised lower-cost energy for people in need","byline":"Rob Davies","body":"<p>As thoughts turn to the colder months ahead, households already grappling with the cost of living crisis have been warned to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/27/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-3850-pounds-russia-cuts-gas-supply-further-europe-pipeline\" title=\"\">brace themselves for punishing energy bills</a>.</p> <p>The price cap – set by energy regulator Ofgem – has already jumped by £693 this year, rising to £1,971 for the average dual fuel tariff from April. But things are about to get a lot worse.</p> <p>According to some estimates, the next cap – to be announced in August and implemented from October – could be set at about £3,500. If, as expected, Ofgem moves to quarterly revisions, a figure of closer to £3,850 has been pencilled in for January, with bills during the first month of 2023 potentially hitting £500.</p> <p>Eight million households are on the brink of fuel poverty, according to the charity National Energy Action. The next prime minister must make bills their number one priority, the power provider Octopus Energy has said, if he or she wants to avoid a “winter cataclysm”.</p> <p>So far, no political party has come up with anything that comes remotely close to tackling a problem of such scale and importance. The government is offering a <a href=\"theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/29/400-in-energy-bill-discounts-to-go-to-all-households-in-england-scotland-and-wales\" title=\"\">£400 rebate on bills</a>. Labour wants to scrap VAT as well, shaving off a further £100. These figures pale in comparison to the £2,500 increase that households will have suffered within a year, if prognoses prove accurate.</p> <p>One idea gaining traction – and proposed last week by MPs on the business and energy select committee – is a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/26/energy-bills-will-plunge-millions-into-unmanageable-debt-warn-mps-ofgem\" title=\"\">social tariff</a>”. But what is it and could it ease the pain for billpayers?</p> <h2>What is a ‘social tariff’?</h2> <p>In short, it involves lower-income households receiving significant discounts on their energy bills, funded by taxation or by spreading the subsidy cost across better-off billpayers. These are already commonplace in telecoms, with some phone and broadband providers offering basic packages for people in receipt of certain benefits, such as universal credit.</p> <p>At the moment, while there is some support available through the warm homes scheme and the new £400 rebate, there is nothing to stop even the very poorest people facing crippling energy bills.</p> <h2>Why is it gaining support?</h2> <p>At the moment, the only thing keeping any kind of lid on energy costs is the price cap, which was introduced by Ofgem in 2019 and covers 22m homes. An attempt to stop energy companies profiteering by putting customers on the most expensive variable tariffs, it limits what is paid for each unit of gas and electricity used.</p> <p>But the prices of gas and electricity are, to a large extent, at the mercy of wholesale markets, which have been sent soaring by factors including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK gets less than 4% of its gas from Russia, but some European countries get more than half. The interconnected nature of gas markets means that when Europe’s gas prices go up, so do Britain’s, as everyone competes for the same commodity.</p> <p>The upshot is that the price cap, which factors in those wholesale market prices, has ratcheted up significantly. For some smaller energy suppliers, many of which had not hedged against such spikes, the cap didn’t rise quickly enough and they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/02/four-more-uk-energy-suppliers-go-bust-amid-high-gas-prices\" title=\"\">simply went bust</a>, exposing a weakness in the system.</p> <p>What’s more, prices look unlikely to come down soon. After Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/germany-accuses-russia-of-power-play-as-gas-pipeline-supply-drops-by-half\" title=\"\">cut supplies into Europe </a>through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline last week, stoking fears of a continent-wide winter gas shortage, analysts at Cornwall Insight predicted that average annual bills of more than £3,500 could be with us “well into 2024”.</p> <p>In a 90-page report published last week, MPs on the influential business and energy select committee threw their weight behind an alternative proposal: the social tariff. This, they said, would offer “deeper price protection for vulnerable consumers”. They were partly persuaded by support for the idea from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jan/31/money-saving-expert-how-martin-lewis-became-most-trusted-man-in-britain-consumer-finance-advice\" title=\"\">Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert</a>, the UK’s go-to expert on thrift and financial justice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef6717f67a85ac2baae25589dee823309af9dab4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef6717f67a85ac2baae25589dee823309af9dab4/0_40_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of complicated pipework at a Nord Stream 1 terminal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russia has cut gas supplies via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How would it work?</h2> <p>There are various options but Fair By Design, a group that campaigns to stop essential services costing more for people in poverty, envisages a social tariff that works as an entitlement for anyone who is in, or at risk of, fuel poverty. This is defined as spending more than 10% of household income on energy.</p> <p>“At the moment, we think it should be about £1,000 of discount per year for a low-income household,” said Carl Packman of Fair By Design and the Barrow Cadbury Trust charitable foundation. He points out that some energy companies used to offer social tariffs before the energy cap, but it was not universal and the terms were defined by individual companies. “We’d like to see one that is market- wide and is defined centrally, so that all suppliers are offering the same,” he said.</p> <h2>Has it been tried elsewhere?</h2> <p>Step forward Belgium, which has had social tariffs for years. Brussels announced a package of measures earlier this year in response to rocketing energy prices, including a VAT cut and one-off payments. It will also extend social tariffs to more households and expand the degree of support available.</p> <p>Those in receipt of the tariff will save an average of €1,760 (£1,480) on bills in the winter months, according to figures from the energy ministry.</p> <h2>What are the drawbacks?</h2> <p>It’s unclear who would administer such a scheme. If suppliers ran it themselves, there would need to be some form of complex data-sharing agreement with the Department for Work and Pensions, to make sure the right people were receiving it. To avoid that, and to be truly universal, a government department or Ofgem would have to run it – a plan unlikely to go down well with proponents of smaller government in the Conservative party.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A social tariff may be an option – but it would need to be accompanied by a reformed price cap</p> <footer> <cite>Spokesperson, Octopus Energy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fair By Design points out there may have to be a tapering system, so that there isn’t a cliff edge, where someone earning only slightly more than their neighbour gets nothing at all.</p> <h2>What do energy firms say?</h2> <p>They are divided. Some of the “big six” providers, such as British Gas, EDF Energy, Scottish Power and E.ON, are broadly in favour. A cynic might say this is because they hope a social tariff will replace the price cap entirely, allowing them to return to charging some people exorbitant amounts, while basking in the good publicity of helping the less fortunate – or simply getting the government to subsidise that part of it.</p> <p>“We need to set a tariff that is affordable for these consumers, not paid for by all other customers but funded by the Treasury,” said Derek Lickorish, chair of energy company Utilita.</p> <p>But a spokesperson for Octopus Energy, one of the challenger brands that has survived the energy crisis, said: “A social tariff may be an option – but it would need to be accompanied by a reformed price cap to protect all customers from the old days of dodgy pricing.”</p> <h2>So the price cap stays?</h2> <p>Fair By Design thinks it should. “We don’t want [the social tariff] to be seen as a replacement for the existing price protections, which serve a purpose too. They’re there to prevent suppliers making exorbitant profits.</p> <p>“This is for particular customers to make sure energy is affordable. It shouldn’t be seen as an either/or.”</p> <p>MPs on the business and energy select committee offer a slightly different vision. They do advocate removing the price cap, but say the social tariff should be accompanied by a “relative” tariff for the rest of the market. This would involve curbing the differential between the cheapest and the most expensive deals – an effort to avoid a return to the days when energy firms put people on sky-high variable tariffs, particularly customers they’d had for a long time who were unlikely to switch.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/30/commanche-falls-thrills-at-goodwood-to-clinch-second-straight-stewards-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T14:56:14Z","webTitle":"Commanche Falls thrills at Goodwood to clinch second straight Stewards’ Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/commanche-falls-thrills-at-goodwood-to-clinch-second-straight-stewards-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/30/commanche-falls-thrills-at-goodwood-to-clinch-second-straight-stewards-cup","fields":{"headline":"Commanche Falls thrills at Goodwood to clinch second straight Stewards’ Cup","trailText":"Connor Beasley ensured Commanche Falls became the first horse to claim double triumphs in the race since 1968","byline":"Greg Wood at Goodwood","body":"<p>Connor Beasley is unlikely to end up with any Classics or Group One races on his CV but he earned at least a footnote in racing’s history books on Saturday as he steered Commanche Falls, a 25-1 chance, to a second successive victory in the Stewards’ Cup.</p> \n<p>Commanche Falls was a much-fancied 10-1 chance for this ultra-competitive sprint handicap last season and was just 2lb higher in the weights for this year’s renewal.

With Liz Truss and fellow Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak both promising to crack down on trade unions, they fear this could set a dangerous precedent for crushing industrial action in higher education. <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/ucu-queen-mary-uol-hardship-fund\" title=\"\">A GoFundMe page</a> to support strikers who have lost their pay has notched up nearly £60,000 in donations.</p> <p>A young researcher in Queen Mary’s film department, who asked not to be named in case of repercussions from management, said: “When people started getting these pay deductions they were freaking out. There was a lot of anger and confusion. We love our jobs but this is bullying. It’s really distressing because you’ve been working really hard even without doing the marking and you discover when you open your payslip that you’ve inadvertently worked for free.”</p> <p>Dr Kate Hall, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Queen Mary who had her pay docked, said “coping without 21 days of pay is extraordinarily difficult”.</p> <p>She said the prospect of losing 42 days’ pay over the whole summer was “so scary”, but insisted academics would not back down. “This has strengthened our resolve as it’s such an extreme response to staff asking for a more sustainable environment to work in.”</p> <p>Miri Rubin, professor of history at Queen Mary, tweeted: “It is like being slapped in the face: in the three – now unpaid – weeks, I directed research, supervised PhDs, advised undergraduates, sat on 2 appointment panels, chaired a school viva, conducted appraisals, and marked all scripts required for our finalists to graduate”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5d6838e8b066a7b7142ed3fc3393c9ce0016006a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d6838e8b066a7b7142ed3fc3393c9ce0016006a/277_356_4635_5795/800.jpg\" alt=\"Laura sits on a step with handbag next to her\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Gray Blair is studying for a PhD and teaching at Queen Mary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Laura Gray Blair, a PhD student who also teaches at the college, said she understood the stress the boycott had caused undergraduates in her department. “I tried to be clear with them that the situation staff are in isn’t sustainable. They are mostly being taught by people on temporary contracts who don’t know if they will have a job next year.” </p> <p>Blair said staff taking part in the boycott had continued to teach and support students in June despite the university warning they wouldn’t be paid. “We did it because we care about our students and many of us couldn’t believe senior management would carry through such a damaging action,” she added.</p> <p>One final-year film student, who asked not to be named, said students did not trust feedback from anonymous replacement markers. “The quality of some of the feedback has been atrocious. Sometimes students have just got one word,” he said.</p> <p>Students who knew about staff having their pay docked were “shocked”, he said. “It seems so cruel. How are lecturers who can’t afford food or rent going to deliver world-class education to us?”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Queen Mary said the impact of the action had been “limited”. “The vast majority of our 32,000 students remain unaffected. Out of a workforce of about 5,400 only 108 people had pay deducted as a result of partial performance in June.”</p> <p>He said: “From the outset of national industrial action, our overriding priority has been to protect our students’ education. We have therefore asked staff to prioritise educational activities and deprioritise other work where needed.”</p> <p>The spokesperson added that the university continued to negotiate but that UCU members “had yet to accept a reasonable agreement”.</p> <p>Goldsmiths, University of London on Friday became one of the last institutions to sign an agreement ending its marking boycott. But a spokesperson said the university was “very sorry that 119 students didn’t receive their marks in time for our summer graduation ceremonies”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jul/28/staff-at-englands-biggest-exam-board-aqa-to-strike-over-pay\">Staff at England’s biggest exam board to strike over pay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said all affected students would now receive their marks, with final-year and international students given priority, and the university would arrange later ceremonies as well as wellbeing support.</p> <p>Nearly 4,000 international academics have <a href=\"https://openletter.earth/reinstate-des-freedman-and-gholam-khiabany-bb8e52b9\" title=\"\">signed a petition</a> to reinstate Prof Des Freedman and Dr Gholam Khiabany, head and deputy head of Goldsmiths’ acclaimed department of media, communications and cultural studies, who were suspended after emailing students explaining they would be unable to graduate.</p> <p>The university declined to comment on this.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/30/kentucky-flash-flooding-death-toll-missing","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T14:50:05Z","webTitle":"Catastrophic flash flooding kills 25 in Kentucky and at least a dozen missing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/kentucky-flash-flooding-death-toll-missing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/kentucky-flash-flooding-death-toll-missing","fields":{"headline":"Catastrophic flash flooding kills 25 in Kentucky and at least a dozen missing","trailText":"Kentucky governor says he expects death toll to rise and warns officials still cannot reach certain areas","byline":"Edward Helmore","body":"<p>Catastrophic flash flooding in eastern Kentucky has now claimed 25 lives, with at least a dozen more people reported missing, as officials in the Appalachian region attempt to calculate the cost of the worst natural disaster there in decades.</p> \n<p>The Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, said he expected the death toll to continue to rise in the state and warned officials still could not reach certain areas.</p> \n<p>Beshear told CNN on Saturday there could be “many more” deaths due to the devastating flooding in the eastern part of the state.</p> \n<p>“It’s going to get worse.

But the scale and intensity of the rainfall that caused the flooding in the remote area has alarmed scientists.</p> \n<p>While the global climate crisis cannot be held directly responsible for most individual weather events, it does make the likelihood and frequency of catastrophic events much more common.</p> \n<p>Bill Haneberg, a climate expert and the state’s geologist, said this rainfall event is “extraordinary” for Kentucky. At least 33,000 people now have no electricity and mudslides have made roads impassable.</p> \n<p>According to the US Geological Survey, Kentucky saw eight to 10 inches of rainfall in a 24-hour period.

The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1808/text\">legislation</a> would criminalize the knowing sale, manufacture, transfer, possession or importation of many types of semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines.</p> <p>“Our nation has watched in unspeakable horror as assault weapons have been used in massacre after massacre in communities across the country,” the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on Friday before the vote. “We know that an assault weapons ban can work because it has worked before.”</p> <p>The Democrat-controlled House judiciary committee estimated last week that the five major gun manufacturers have collected more than $1bn from the sale of assault rifles in the past decade.</p> <p>New York Democrat Carolyn Maloney said that gun manufacturers use “dangerous selling tactics to sell assault weapons to the public”, including “marketing to children, preying on young men’s insecurities and even appealing to violent white supremacists.”.</p> <p>Cogressman Brad Schneider, who represents Highland Park in Illinois where a mass shooter recently disrupted a Fourth of July parade with a hail of gunfire, killing seven, said at the hearing that “the shooter was able to fire off his bullets so fast that they couldn’t even identify where they were coming from”.</p> <p>But in the 50-50 evenly-split Senate, the bill is unlikely to pass despite a political breakthrough last month in bringing the bill forward.

The hosts Ramtin Arablouei and Rund Abdelfatah look at the past to understand what’s happening now. For example, they did a great episode on the 1918 pandemic and how that links to what we’re going through. They draw so many lines through historical events, it feels a bit like the Roman god Janus looking to the past and the future. Also, the episodes are meaty – most are about an hour long – so it’s a nice train journey.</p> <h2>4.

He is 43 and knew this might be his last chance to do it.</p> \n<p>Seventy minutes into the race, it became clear he was going to. Weir had a 90-second lead over the field, with six miles or so to go.

Soon after his teammate, Johnboy Smith, had passed him. Smith, 32, called out to ask Weir what had happened and swore out loud when he found out. “I didn’t want to win by default,” Smith said.</p> \n<p>He fancied he could catch Weir, and was annoyed that he had been robbed of the chance to make a race of it. Behind him, Weir ended up coming in seventh, 24 minutes after Smith. He got a hell of an ovation when he finished. “Where I come from,” he said, “you don’t give up.”</p> \n<p>Weir wasn’t sure how it happened, he hadn’t hit anything and they were new tyres, too. He was left cursing himself. He never carries spares, worried it would be a jinx. “But the last few weeks I just had this gut feeling that something like this would happen. I even told my wife that I might take a spare with me, I brought the CO2 canisters and everything, and all week I was asking myself: ‘should I take it?’”</p> \n<p>On the start line, Weir said, he was still looking in his kitbag asking himself whether or not to take the equipment with him. He decided not to. “I should have gone with my gut.”</p> \n<p>He was convinced that he had enough of a lead to make the change and get back in the race. “Even if John had caught me I could have made it a sprint finish.” He was utterly dejected.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"629e71d8add6ddd591c56779846edbaaf8deb295\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/629e71d8add6ddd591c56779846edbaaf8deb295/0_212_4752_2851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Johnboy Smith after winning gold in the men’s T53/54 marathon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Johnboy Smith after winning gold in the men’s T53/54 marathon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Weir has spoken frankly about how badly he has suffered with depression in the past, especially after the Rio Paralympics in 2016. He had a bad time at the Tokyo Games last year and had clearly invested a lot in the idea of winning here. “I’m feeling despair,” he said, “and I’ve never felt despair in a race before.”</p> \n<p>In its way, Smith’s victory was a reminder of everything Weir has achieved in his career. Smith, a Traveller, was paralysed at 16 when he was shot in the back by a farmer who was wrongly convinced he was poaching from him. The farmer was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm.</p> \n<p>Smith started competing in weightlifting, then switched to throwing events after he was inspired by the London Paralympics in 2012. Then he decided to change again to wheelchair racing. He wasn’t sure how to start so typed “where does David Weir train?” into Google and went from there.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2eafeaf5-fb23-4b45-a4e7-496afe5098b1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>One of the leading contenders for the men’s marathon at the Commonwealth Games was forced to watch the event from the sidelines after Kenyan officials apparently entered the wrong Eric for the event.</p>\n    <p>Eric Kiptanui, who has named in the Kenyan squad in May, was supposed to compete but when he arrived at the start line he found that somehow a 21-year-old runner called <b>Eric Kiplagat Sang</b> had being entered instead.

They were puzzled by fans who waited at the gates and in the trees outside Graceland. Presley told his stepbrothers: “I’m just an entertainer.”</p> <p>In 1961, aged eight, Stanley attended his first Presley concert: “Suddenly the lights went down and people began to scream. That scared us, so we looked back at Mom and Vernon.

When I hear my own music, all I want to do is go fix it. But I can’t, because it’s already been done.’ ”</p> <p>Stanley would hear Presley singing around the house, usually gospel songs: “It was how he would unwind after a concert.

This summer, she has already wowed crowds at Glastonbury and Latitude. But waiting for her closeup is <a href=\"https://phoebefuckingbridgers.com/\">Phoebe Bridgers</a>, a four-time Grammy-nominated artist who has just swiftly sold out four nights at Brixton’s generously proportioned Academy (that’s in the region of 19,600 tickets) as part of an extended European tour that included opening for the Rolling Stones in Hyde Park. Her merch queue clogs up the entire foyer, upstairs and down. Her singing – winsome, numinous, but tough at the same time – is often drowned out by the word-perfect crowd.</p> <p>After making waves with her debut, 2017’s <em>Stranger in the Alps</em>, Bridgers’s second outing, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/21/phoebe-bridgers-punisher-review-confident-second-album\">Punisher</a></em>, hit hard on release in long-ago 2020. It has only kept growing in significance, appearing on virtually every albums of the year list in 2020 and winning the LA native celebrity endorsers. Elton John said he’d “hit someone” if she didn’t win a Grammy; Taylor Swift has been effusive in her praise of Bridgers – and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yMRNTKihr_0\">collaborated with her</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p> She dedicates a song to the dads in the audience – a fan subset whose number is greater than you might have expected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bridgers’s very newest song, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RtOYYp010lA\">Sidelines</a>, is a subtle slow-burner about the anaesthetic of depression wearing off in the face of love.

Tonight is no exception. The “voice of a generation” tag is one that is probably thrown about too liberally, but in an era in which female anomie and solo female singer-songwriters are forces in the ascendant, Bridgers very much has her foot on the monitor of the well-turned melodic confessional.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtOYYp010lA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RtOYYp010lA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/RtOYYp010lA\">Watch the video for Phoebe Bridgers’ Sidelines.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>“I’m actually pretty positive,” she quips, making it clear that fetishising mental ill-health is not her intention in the introduction to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jcq5NlYz1PU\">Funeral</a>, a song that nailed on Bridgers’s “sad girl” maven status. (“Jesus Christ,” it goes, “I’m so blue all the time.”)</p> <p>She grabs an adoring audience by the lapels from the off tonight with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9sfYpolGCu8\">Motion Sickness</a>, an old song about her power-imbalanced relationship with alt country singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/06/ryan-adams-apologises-for-his-mistreatment-of-friends-and-colleagues\">Ryan Adams</a>, 20 years her senior, who provided an “in” to the industry, but at a price. Shortly after comes a crowd-pleaser off <em>Punisher</em>: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Tw0zYd0eIlk\">Kyoto</a> is a breezy tune in which Bridgers, on tour in Japan, ponders her vexed relationship with her unimpressive father. She dedicates the song to the dads in the audience – a fan subset whose number is greater than you might have expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a69261ac2bbea1607bd5370acbccd186c2a25b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a69261ac2bbea1607bd5370acbccd186c2a25b3/0_0_4828_3190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phoebe Bridgers performs at the Brixton Academy, London. 26/7/22\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For all the generational sadness that fuels her songs, there’s a lot going on in Bridgers’s body of work that leaps demographics. With a wink, her tour is called the Reunion tour, a reference to old bands getting back together. She often hitches her melodies to churning guitars that locate her firmly in the indie rock continuum; the excellent trumpet work by JJ Kirkpatrick adds a stately lushness tonight, fleshing out her sound. Bridgers’s grasp of the wider rock canon percolates away in the background. Her songs are very contemporary, but many old dudes are here in cameo. On the lovelorn <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DXqZ66XK3z8\">Moon Song</a>, her characters agree about Eric Clapton and argue over John Lennon. On <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vAKg267JgBE\">Smoke Signals</a>, she references the Smiths’ How Soon Is Now?, the death of David Bowie and Thom Yorke (indirectly).</p> <p>But Bridgers’s devotion to this male pantheon is not total or blind. When she theatrically smashed a guitar on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in 2021 and David Crosby sniffed his disapproval, she was quick to call him a “little bitch” on Twitter, where she has long been a witty and sincere presence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/24/phoebe-bridgers-glastonbury-roe-v-wade-taylor-swift-paul-mescal\">Phoebe Bridgers on Taylor Swift, her boyfriend Paul Mescal and speaking out on Roe v Wade: ‘I want to show everybody what I believe in’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bridgers’s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/16/834971727/phoebe-bridgers-elliott-smith-figure-8-20th-anniversary?t=1658926557341&amp;t=1658935137071\">devotion to Elliott Smith</a>, the cult singer-songwriter who took his own life in 2003, does provide a bass-note thrum throughout.

None of this detracts from the originality and immediacy of Bridgers’s warm, keyboard-enhanced sound tonight. The band are dressed as skeletons (a goofy, spooky Bridgers signature), while Bridgers herself is in a cream suit whose waistcoat features a tasselled design of ribs. The songs’ sadness is very much offset by the cleverness of the pop-up-book stage set.

I know that sounds like a ridiculous question, but some people on the far right would like it to be. Social media was recently <a href=\"https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32EX3VW\">awash with outrage</a> over a bill introduced by North Carolina state legislators that would legalize violence against anyone undergoing or performing an abortion. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220710020606/https:/webservices.ncleg.gov/ViewBillDocument/2021/661/0/DRH40068-MLy-38A\">North Carolina House Bill (HB) 158</a>, sponsored by a Republican state representative, Larry Pittman, proposed that abortion be considered first-degree murder and would have allowed civilians to use deadly force to prevent someone from ending a pregnancy.</p> <p>While this is clearly terrifying, it should be noted that a lot of discussion circulating about the bill online wasn’t accurate: the outrage was sparked by a somewhat misleading post that made it look like the bill was actively being considered. In fact, however, HB 158 was introduced in February 2021 and didn’t advance out of committee. An <a href=\"https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32EX3VW\">AFP fact check</a> also notes that it received little support from legislators.</p> <p>Still, even though the bill was largely performative, that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be taken seriously. The far right constantly introduce extreme bills like this into state legislatures with the full knowledge that there is zero chance they will pass. It’s part of a broader strategy to further their agenda that can be summed up as <em>exhaust and inure</em>. <em>Exhaust</em>: the more they overwhelm legislatures with extreme legislation, the harder it becomes for liberals to fight them. It becomes a game of “Whac-a-Mole”. <em>Inure: </em>proposing extreme ideas like this via legislation helps gradually desensitize people and shifts the Overton window to the right; step by step the unthinkable becomes mainstream.</p> <p>All this isn’t just my personal opinion, by the way: it’s extracted from a playbook written by Christian nationalists. A few years ago a <a href=\"https://religiondispatches.org/project-blitz-seeks-to-do-for-christian-nationalism-what-alec-does-for-big-business/\">researcher called Frederick Clarkson</a> uncovered an initiative from a coalition of far-right Christian groups called Project Blitz that gave their supporters detailed instructions on how to codify their views into law and gradually destroy the division between church and state. I highly recommend reading Clarkson’s <a href=\"https://religiondispatches.org/project-blitz-seeks-to-do-for-christian-nationalism-what-alec-does-for-big-business/\">writings</a> on Project Blitz: they are essential for understanding the current moment. As Clarkson said when he first found the playbook: “It’s very rare that you come across a major primary source document that changes the way you view everything, and this is one of those times. This is a 116-page strategy manual hidden away on a website explaining at least what a section of the religious right are doing in the United States.”</p> <p>Bills like the one in North Carolina, it can’t be stressed enough, are not just frivolous one-offs by extremists. They’re part of a coordinated – and highly effective – strategy to consolidate power by the right. Democrats should really be paying more attention to these tactics and learning from them. So many centrists are afraid that suggesting things like free healthcare will make them look like radicals hellbent on bringing communism to America. You think the right care about looking “radical”? Of course not. They care about power. And they’re very good at doing whatever it takes to get it.</p> <h2>South Carolina bill outlaws websites explaining how to get an abortion</h2> <p>Want another example of that “Whac-a-Mole” strategy in action? South Carolina state senators <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/22/south-carolina-bill-abortion-websites/\">recently introduced legislation</a> that would make it illegal to host a website or “[provide] an internet service” with information that is “reasonably likely to be used for an abortion”. This is incredibly far-reaching language that means even news stories related to reproductive rights could be censored. This bill is unconstitutional and it’s not clear that it will be law anytime soon. But, again, that doesn’t make it any less worrying. As one expert told the Washington Post: “These are not going to be one-offs. These are going to be laws that spread like wildfire through states that have shown hostility to abortion.”</p> <h2>A 99-year-old’s dying wish was for a giant penis statue over her grave</h2> <p>I would describe this as a snippet of much-needed light news, but there is nothing light about the penis and testicles that now sit on top of Catarina Orduña Pérez’s grave: they weigh nearly 600 pounds. The statue is also five-a-half-foot tall. “She told me that [the statue] was her desire so that no one would forget her and that everything we loved about her would be remembered more easily,” <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnnqw/mexico-dick-tombstone?\">Pérez’s grandson told Vice</a>. A legend.</p> <h2>Shireen Abu Akleh’s family demand US action</h2> <p>It has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/17/shireen-abu-aqleh-was-a-lifeline-for-palestinians-and-her-killing-has-shaken-us-to-the-core\">over two months</a> now since the Palestinian American journalist was killed while covering a military raid in the occupied West Bank. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/24/israel-un-shireen-american-journalist/\">UN rights body investigation</a> found that the shot that killed Abu Akleh came from Israeli security forces, echoing eyewitness accounts of the shooting and analysis by other rights groups. Still, the US seems to have no desire to ensure there is accountability for her death; the journalist’s family travelled to Washington to beg the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to do something this week and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/28/shireen-abu-akleh-palestinian-journalist-killed-00048582\">he fobbed them off</a>. If Abu Akleh had been murdered in Ukraine by Russian forces, I think the US response would be rather different. When journalists are killed by US allies (Jamal Khashoggi comes to mind), the US seems to rather relax its concerns about things like human rights and accountability.</p> <h2>‘I will never regret the time I spent with my children, but society is punishing me for it in my 60s’</h2> <p>“Precarity can happen so easily to anyone,” writes Louise Ihlein in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/26/i-will-never-regret-the-time-i-spent-with-my-children-but-society-is-punishing-me-for-it-in-my-60s\">powerful piece in the Guardian</a>. “[B]ut it happens a lot to women who have spent their lives caring for others.”</p> <h2>Being a woman in Afghanistan has become ‘death in slow motion’</h2> <p>A chilling new report released by Amnesty International documents how the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan have been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/07/27/1114033369/what-its-like-being-a-woman-in-afghanistan-today-death-in-slow-motion\">“decimated by the Taliban”</a> in less than a year.

Write your name!” I knew exactly what she meant, so I wrote: “Lots of love, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rob-brydon\" title=\"\">Rob Brydon</a>,” and off she went, happy as Larry.</p> <p><strong>If I’m not performing</strong> or doing a show, I like to be on a golf course. I’ve even started playing golf with my wife. She’s really competitive, so she gets grumpy, but I love playing with her. Last year I learned my whole panto script on the golf course.

Her father, Terry Yorath, played for Leeds United, Coventry City and Tottenham Hotspur, and represented Wales both as a player and manager. But the women’s game is about far more than “just kicking a football on a pitch,” she said.</p> <p>As the most high profile of women’s sports in England, and the fastest growing, she said the potential of women’s football is “enormous”. “For me, it’s about the possibilities in women’s sport, and also within the world and society, and how we are treated and how society reflects its values.”</p> <p>Having a double female commentary team for England games has helped ensure that the broadcasts are “not just a shop window for a few women playing football,” she said. “This is about reflecting society. And that bleeds down to all areas of what we’re doing. So that has been another shift in the alchemy of the success of the tournament.”</p> <p>Many women in football have not had the opportunity to grow their careers until recently, she said, meaning they have had to get up to speed very fast. “But they’re doing brilliantly and there are more opportunities out there for them now than ever before because there are more platforms, more interest, more female football writers.”</p> <p>But on the pitch, representation issues loom large for England and its stark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/18/england-women-squad-euro-2022-whiteness-diversity\" title=\"\">lack of racial diversity</a>. Following England’s match against Norway, BBC presenter Eilidh Barbour said: “All starting 11 players and the five substitutes that came on to the pitch were white. And that does point towards a lack of diversity in the women’s game in England.”</p> <p>While Logan said that, in the past, England has had many black players and a black manager – Hope Powell was the first black and female coach of an England side – “in this current starting 11 that isn’t the case”.</p> <p>The problem lies, she said, with the development of academies, which she said have “squeezed out” some children, who may previously have been scouted like her co-host and former England defender Scott was, playing in a football cage in Tower Hamlets. “What the academies have got to be mindful of is that they are not just taking in kids who turn up and they are making sure that kids with talent, who can’t get to academies for whatever reason, are not excluded.”</p> <p>The reason this does not happen in the men’s game, she added, is because young boys are viewed as “very valuable commodities” which means academies do what it takes to find the most talented boys to train with them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"852dab0678da6f9028ddec6d61f436a79996734f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/852dab0678da6f9028ddec6d61f436a79996734f/0_114_2724_1634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England manager Sarina Wiegman celebrates after the match against Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England manager Sarina Wiegman celebrates after the match against Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The FA’s appointment of Dutch former player and manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/23/sarina-wiegman-england-lionesses-coach-womens-football-team-euro-semi-finals\" title=\"\">Sarina Wiegman</a>, who started as England manager last September, was “genius”, said Logan, describing her as “an extraordinary leader”.

I remember saying to my teacher, “I want to do the Oxford and Cambridge entrance,” and she said, “I don’t think you’re up to it.” Looking back, I can see that she thought a black girl whose parents left school at 14 doesn’t go to Oxford or Cambridge.</p> <p><strong>Katharine</strong> That teacher was a terrible teacher. My whole life has been about ensuring that children can aspire to be whatever they want to be. There are children who have all sorts of talents and achieve all sorts of things – we should celebrate them, not just the ones who become rich bankers in the city.</p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> I don’t celebrate rich bankers in the City!</p> <p><strong>Katharine</strong> It’s the Hollywood rags-to-riches story, someone from the slums who ends up as a CEO, but there are all sorts of people who make shorter leaps.</p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> I have a problem with anyone who would cap children’s aspirations because that was done to me. It’s only because I was – even then – quite stubborn that I was able to overcome it. </p> <p><strong>Katharine</strong> You’re preaching to the converted. I’ve worked in education for 25 years; 82% of my children go to Russell Group universities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3db4c2b6b4ea18e93d4246972d9d2736c745047\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3db4c2b6b4ea18e93d4246972d9d2736c745047/0_612_7787_4672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Abbott and Katharine Birbalsingh at a restaurant table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The </strong><strong>big </strong><strong>beef</strong></p> <p><strong>Katharine</strong> There are issues in terms of expecting too little from children who come from a variety of different backgrounds that could be considered disadvantaged. For instance, the way it can often go is if a black child doesn’t bring in his homework there’s a sense of, well, he might come from a difficult background, it’s hard for him, perhaps he has a single mum, we can’t really expect as much of him as we can from another child, so it’s OK, we’ll let it go. If this happens over time, in the end the black child falls behind because the expectations of him are less than they would be of, say, the white, middle-class child.</p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> Your argument is that the real problem black children have is teachers who are too kind to them?</p> <p><strong>Katharine</strong> It masquerades as compassion, but actually it’s a way of letting children down.</p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> I’ve worked in an inner-city area for 35 years. I’m very interested in education. I visit schools, I talk to parents about their children and I don’t recognise this idea that black children are being let off lightly. You know as well as I do that the level of exclusions for black boys is much higher than for white boys. This doesn’t suggest to me that it is about letting them off; it suggests a system that is quick to make judgments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Katharine</strong> The number one thing holding children back in schools is poor behaviour, and that is because of poor leadership decisions in the school. If you have an environment that demands high standards, the children will rise to the standards. If you’re relaxed about behaviour, the more vulnerable children – because of race, class, they live on the local estate, they are SEN, it could be anything – end up falling off the wagon. People call me the strictest headteacher in Britain, but all that means is we’ve got order and structure in the school, which means children can thrive in an environment that is safe and secure.</p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> I would say that the one thing that holds black children back is teachers’ preconceptions. I go back to the teacher who told me I was not up to the Cambridge entrance exam. Even teachers who think they are nice have preconceptions, especially about black boys, and if you have preconceptions about children they can live down to them. That’s why I come back to changing the atmosphere in the classroom and having a more diverse mixture of teachers. I’m not against discipline – I come from a working-class, West Indian background. The thing about discipline is that it has to be done with love and you’re not just arbitrarily saying: you can’t speak in the corridor.</p> <p><strong>Katharine</strong> I agree they need to know that they are immersed in love; they need to feel that you are on their side and the system is fair. So our children will do things like thank the teachers for giving them detention because they know they are trying to help them stay on the straight and narrow.</p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> That’s a bit extreme!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9fb0dfc5d17694310b88971485478af047e7aaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9fb0dfc5d17694310b88971485478af047e7aaf/0_550_8109_4866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Abbott and Katharine Birbalsingh at a restaurant table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Sharing plate</strong></p> <p><strong>Katharine</strong> Both our mothers are Jamaican nurses who came to this country at a similar time, which is a lovely thing.</p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> This is a bit irrational, but because of my family I’m prepared to give people of Jamaican origin the benefit of the doubt because it is a very specific experience.

I remember being called racist names, being excluded from friendship groups. People would come up to me and rub my skin, and say, “Does it come off?” Everyone talked about the local shop using the P-word. Now if a child was racist in any way, the other children simply would not accept it; it’s blasphemous.</p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> I think teachers have mastered the language of anti-racism, but in terms of the preconceptions about children, I’m not sure much has changed. And sadly, because I’ve spent my life campaigning on these issues, I wouldn’t say policing has got much better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3767656bc38d698aad7e43194649807c506448a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3767656bc38d698aad7e43194649807c506448a4/0_546_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diane Abbott and Katharine Birbalsingh at a restaurant table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p> <p><strong>Diane</strong> It’s important to meet and listen to people – that’s what politics is about.</p> <p><strong>Katharine</strong> I do feel I have to defend myself against various assumptions you think I think, which I don’t actually think.

Thereafter the full gamut of orchestral hardware rides the sonic storm, with two harps in swift glissando, strings, brass and woodwind careering across the stave and the organ joining the roar. “See where their white sails, bellying in the wind, Speckle the green and blue” as Walt Whitman, whose mystical-visionary poems Vaughan WIlliams sets here, expresses it.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019c6j\">Prom 16</a></strong> was reassuringly full on Wednesday – compared with recent thin attendance, and despite that day’s rail strike – to hear the BBC Symphony Chorus, the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales and soloists, conducted by Andrew Manze.

Listening again to the Vaughan Williams, and hearing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0cn28ts\">Verdi’s Requiem</a>, it appears choral works suffer, with soloists favoured in the microphone setup, chorus diminished in the process. Yet the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, who performed another epic symphony, Rachmaninov’s Second, at Monday’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019cps\">Prom 14</a></strong>, came across with terrific flair on a second listen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5c4ffbd33b0b88299a8e3b1c2110fdc0fb5584d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5c4ffbd33b0b88299a8e3b1c2110fdc0fb5584d/0_181_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conductor Kazuki Yamada, violinist Elena Urioste and horn player Ben Goldscheider at the CBSO’s Prom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conductor Kazuki Yamada, violinist Elena Urioste and horn player Ben Goldscheider at the CBSO’s Prom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The work’s contours and pattern of tension and release, elusive in the hall, were now bold and defined, full of sensuous detail. The CBSO’s gifted conductor designate, Kazuki Yamada, has charm in abundance. I look forward to getting to know the partnership properly in their acoustically rewarding home base, Symphony Hall. To open the Prom, Yamada conjured a mercurial performance of Glinka’s Overture to <em>Ruslan and Lyudmila</em>.

These talents are combined in the figure of <a href=\"https://www.marciodasilva.com/biography\">Marcio da Silva</a>, the Brazilian founder of <a href=\"https://www.ensembleorquesta.com/\">Ensemble OrQuesta</a>, a group of young artists who perform baroque opera. His drive and focus informed the group’s powerful staging of Monteverdi’s <strong>L’incoronazione di Poppea</strong>, the opening event in that annual box of pleasures, <a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/grimeborn/\">Grimeborn </a>opera festival. In the confined space of the Arcola theatre, the direction, wisely, is kept simple and formal. Props are a plinth-like bed, a chair and a chalkboard to notch up deaths in ancient Rome. Sightlines may prevent you from seeing all the action, or the tireless and eloquent musicians (seven, including de Silva). No matter. All 10 singers impressed, the cast led superbly by Helen May (Poppea) and Julia Portela Piñón (Nerone).</p> <p>The plot of <em>Poppea</em> may be morally scrambled but the meaning is transparent. Love, distorted by egotism, curdles into humanity’s most destructive force. Monteverdi’s music, conversely, ebbs and flows, in generous, pulsating waves, culminating in the ecstatic Pur ti miro, Pur ti godo. I’m obliged to say, before someone writes in, that the authorship of this duet is disputed. The only response is to rejoice that it exists.

If you fall on a mountain, you will die,” says SK, a 15-year-old who is fleeing Afghanistan. “If you pass, you will win. That’s why they call it the game.” Slapping this pop-culture filter on the harsh realities of globalisation gives this Dutch documentary a high-concept jolt, but in actuality it is probably the only way for such young minds to process the traumatic enormity of what they are engaged in, and make light of their own vulnerability.</p> <p>The distances involved – with some of those playing the “pedestrian game” walking overland from Syria to the Balkans – are mind-boggling. But we are a generation on from the rickety human-trafficking supply lines of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_This_World\">Michael Winterbottom’s In This World</a>; many of these migrants seem relatively well-resourced, buying winter clothing and mobile phones to replace confiscated ones en route.

Often shot in bleary night vision or under sodium lights in interstitial border zones and camps, their ordeals linger with a near-hallucinatory power. But with the testimony of 10 or so different migrants all intermingled, individual journeys get subsumed – perhaps intentionally – into a collective portrait of “the game”.

If the Czech Republic is to complete the journey from deep climate change scepticism to full recognition of the global heating crisis, history may record that the common experience of awakening to a pervading burning smell marked a turning point.</p> <p>This was the sensation that greeted inhabitants of Prague and other towns and cities last Monday morning as smoke from a blaze that had broken out the previous day in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/picture/2016/apr/21/bohemian-switzerland-national-park-czech-republic\">Bohemian Switzerland</a>, a storied forested area close to the German border, wafted across the country and seeped into the popular consciousness.</p> <p>In scenes that Czechs previously associated with Hollywood disaster films or news footage from more southern climes, more than 400 firefighters spent the rest of the week trying to extinguish flames that spread over 1,200 hectares of the popular national park area, which was used as a location for the <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> films.</p> <p>Hundreds of people were evacuated as emergency services scrambled – eventually successfully – to preserve the <a href=\"https://www.visitczechrepublic.com/en-US/ede74964-bc4e-4146-994b-7f3abfa69d10/place/c-pravcicka-brana\">Pravčická Brana archway</a>, one of Europe’s most striking rock formations. The border crossing into Germany in the nearby village of Hřensko was closed.</p> <p>Declaring it the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/jul/26/hundreds-evacuated-czech-german-firefighters-battle-wildfire-video\">worst forest fire in the nation’s history</a>, the Czech authorities requested help from other countries. Two extinguisher planes from Sweden arrived on Friday to replace Italian aircraft that had to be redeployed to Italy to tackle forest fires there; Slovakia sent 30 military personnel along with a UH-60M Blackhawk helicopter adapted to fight fires.</p> <p>The overstretched fire service advised people to close their windows, and pointedly requested them not to call emergency lines unless they saw signs of fire in their locality. The appeal reflected the fact that reports of smoke were being received in Prague, 60 miles to the south, and as far away as Pardubice, more than 120 miles away.</p> <p>“It was literally a wake-up call, or a wake-up smell, for many people,” said Petr Kutilek, a political scientist and member of the Czech Green party, reflecting a belief that the event could propel climate change to the top of the country’s political agenda.</p> <p>Police are investigating suspicions that the fire was sparked by human negligence. But its rapid spread at a time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/22/weather-tracker-record-breaking-heat-continues-scorch-western-europe\">record-high temperatures</a>, and similar blazes elsewhere in Europe and beyond, has increased acceptance that the emergency is real even in circles that were once hotbeds of denial.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/28/czech-president-swears-in-petr-fiala-as-new-pm-behind-glass-screen\">Petr Fiala, the Czech prime minister</a> – whose Civic Democrat (ODS) party has long been considered climate-sceptic – told the Prima TV channel after visiting the scene that he would “have to wear blinkers and not think rationally … if I did not see that the climate is changing in a certain way and that the whole of Europe is facing fires caused by unusually high temperatures”.</p> <p>That view was a far cry from the hardline climate change denialism of the former Czech prime minister and president Václav Klaus – a co-founder of Fiala’s party – who branded global warming “bogus” and called campaigners against it “<a href=\"https://english.radio.cz/president-klaus-makes-new-comments-about-climate-change-do-they-echo-views-8599604\">a threat to freedom and economic growth</a>”.</p> <p>Other weather-related encounters in the Czech Republic have fuelled a shift in sentiment – particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2021/jun/25/czech-republic-tornado-deaths-villages-damage-south-moravia-hodonin-hrusky\">a deadly tornado</a> that struck several villages in the south Moravia region last summer, killing six and injuring hundreds more.</p> <p>Even before that, a survey conducted for Czech Radio found that 93% of Czechs accepted that climate change existed, with 86% expecting it to change the world. But in a striking contradiction, only 39% expected it to affect them personally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c9504bab4253111954cb97743ac3a797bb42eb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c9504bab4253111954cb97743ac3a797bb42eb6/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The blaze was declared the worst forest fire in the nation’s history.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The blaze was declared the worst forest fire in the nation’s history.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michal Čížek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such lingering scepticism raises questions over the political will to embrace mitigating policies – doubts crystallised last month when the Czech environment minister, Anna Hubáčková, declared that cars with internal combustion engines would continue to be sold after 2035, despite an EU directive banning them in line with the bloc’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/14/eus-green-deal-plans-launched-with-make-or-break-decade-warning\">Green Deal climate package</a>.</p> <p>“The current cabinet has upheld some of the key legislation that in the long-term favours the Czech energy conglomerates benefiting from the current energy mix,” said Albin Sybera, a Czech political analyst. “There’s a reluctance to clash with the powerful lobby that has kept that mix together – and which could be undone by a greater share of renewables, for example. That’s why the main parties in the ruling coalition are reluctant to recognise the urgency to act – even in the face of a devastating fire that has destroyed swathes of the country’s most remarkable national park.”</p> <p>This caution has a historical irony. Officially tolerated environmental activism under the communist dictatorship of the former Czechoslovakia is credited with having helped trigger the 1989 velvet revolution.

Wilde was 20 when she released her debut hit, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UqMcevcUmqg\" title=\"\">Kids in America</a>: a track co-written by her father and brother Ricky that laid the groundwork for her to become one of Britain’s most successful female solo acts of the 1980s. In 1998, Wilde went off-grid, retraining as a landscape gardener before presenting horticultural shows on the BBC and Channel 4, winning a gold medal at Chelsea flower show and releasing two gardening books. She returned to the stage in 2001, and Kim Wilde: the Greatest Hits Tour is at venues across the UK from 10 September.</p> <p><strong>The very gorgeous </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/26/anton-corbjin-portraits-interview-david-bowie-naomi-campbell-virgil-abloh\" title=\"\">Anton Corbijn</a></strong> took this photo of me aged 25 and standing outside Rak Records, Mickie Most’s label. I’ve gone for a 60s look – wearing striped trousers and a white belt from Kings Road in London, which is where I bought most of my clothes from. I was very inspired by Hollywood photos of Lauren Bacall, and loved the images of her looking absolutely terrifying. I thought: “That’s a great pose to do in front of the camera.”</p> <p>I was having a brilliant time back then. Even though I was spending a lot of time in airport queues and checking into hotels, or hanging out backstage at TV studios and doing a lot of miming, I was living the dream. I’d wanted to be on Top of the Pops from the first moment I watched it, and to meet these enigmatic pop stars, my idols and people whose records I was buying, like Heaven 17 and ABC, was fabulous. However, no matter how successful I got, I never felt part of the scene. In fact, I felt like a bit of an impostor – mostly because my goal was never to be a pop star, but to write songs and be an accomplished musician. I wasn’t wrapped up in fashion to any great extent. At first I just wanted to be a session singer and to get some money – I learned that the more harmonies you did on someone else’s song, the more cash you got. But once I found myself there, I thought: “OK then, this is what I’ll do.”</p> <p>Although to the public I probably had this image of being young, gorgeous and available, I didn’t feel that way at all. Kids in America was an incredible way to start my career, but I still experienced all the same insecurities anyone does in their 20s. Besides, I didn’t believe that my beauty was particularly great. The way I looked didn’t make me feel prettier or better about myself. I never presumed that one’s image was a passport to romantic happiness; in fact the two never seemed to go hand in hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I didn’t take fame too seriously either.</strong> I wasn’t in that bedroom when the kid put the poster up of me, so it always felt like a very distant concept. When this photo was taken, I was still living at home. I had a baby sister whose nappy I was changing after Top of the Pops. Life was very normal. I wasn’t to be found at the latest nightclub hanging out with famous people. Quite the opposite: for most of the early days I was still gossiping with the girls I went to school with.</p> <p>Largely that has to do with my dad. While he never sat me down and gave me the 10 point guide to fame, I just observed the way he handled himself. He always worked really hard, but he didn’t believe success gave him the right to be more important than anyone else. The biggest love of his life was rock and pop, and growing up he was constantly playing music of every kind: from classical to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/27/the-beach-boys-40-greatest-songs-ranked\" title=\"\">Pet Sounds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/20/mike-oldfield-interview-tubular-bells-drugs\" title=\"\">Mike Oldfield</a> to Elvis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/crosbystillsnashandyoung\" title=\"\">Crosby, Stills and Nash</a>. Music was our family’s religion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I was frightened no one would want to see me on stage any more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My parents were young – they were only 20 when they had me and Ricky – and were having more parties than I was. They were probably having a hell of a lot more sex than I was, too. The biggest shock to them was when I came back with blond hair, while at art college. They said I looked great and I thought: “How annoying is that?” There wasn’t much to rebel against. The 80s was a wild time for a lot of people – especially if you were doing a lot of drugs. But that lifestyle never appealed to me. I knew how to drink champagne, copiously, but that was it. Besides, I just always felt really privileged and lucky to be in the situation that I was in – to produce a record with my brother and go out on stage to perform.</p> <p><strong>I decided to change my life</strong> when I turned 30: my career had been incredibly successful, I had platinum records under my belt, but I felt lost. Instead, I decided to get married and become a mother. I moved into gardening; signing up to Capel Manor College to do a part-time gardening course. It was a fairly small class of 20 – and while everyone had a handle on who I was, my previous profession was irrelevant: everyone was more interested in our shared passion for plants and their Latin names. It was a life-changing experience, and wonderful to slip into an anonymity where “Kim Wilde” didn’t matter any more. I morphed into this earthy version of myself, not a trace of lipstick – although I mostly kept the blond hair.</p> <p><strong>When my children got a bit older</strong> I was seduced into going on an 80s revival tour. There was part of me that was really inquisitive as to what it would be like to hang out with the Human League, Nik Kershaw and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/07/clare-grogan-i-drew-on-my-pop-star-past-to-write-a-book-for-my-daughter\" title=\"\">Clare Grogan</a>. I thought it could be fun, even though I reckoned I’d hate it and was frightened no one would want to see me on stage – a married woman with two kids who’s not a size eight anymore. “It’s all over!” I imagined they’d think when they saw me up there. Instead, I was staggered to see a huge audience who didn’t care that I was no longer the 21-year-old version of myself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/16/dermot-oleary-looks-back-bowl-on-head-for-haircut\">Dermot O’Leary looks back: ‘I don’t remember having a bowl on my head for a haircut’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At 62, I’ve never felt more of a pop star, and I appreciate that I’ve had my own careful journey to arrive at this rather audacious place where I am now. I always had a strong sense of my identity, but I am now brave enough to wear these costumes; to walk out in front of a crowd dressed in a Barbarella outfit while holding a space-age laser gun. It’s not just the elaborate outfits either – I feel as if I’m finally growing into myself. I’m better at standing my ground; I don’t blanche every time someone calls me an icon; and I find the stage the most natural place in the world to be. I would never have said that in the middle of the 80s! The girl in the photo certainly would have found that concept impossible.</p> <p>Sometimes I see young artists with all the confidence I have now, but at the start of their career. While I recoil and think “How did you do that? Who are you?” I’m happy my life has held back some weird and lovely surprises. I’m not going to be running around this planet for that much longer, and I don’t have time to sit around pondering about impostor syndrome any more. I want to jump in and be as bold as I can be. After all, my dad is still touring and he’s 83.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/30/10-moments-that-changed-womens-football-in-england","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T11:00:24Z","webTitle":"Hope and glory: 10 moments that changed women’s football in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/10-moments-that-changed-womens-football-in-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/30/10-moments-that-changed-womens-football-in-england","fields":{"headline":"Hope and glory: 10 moments that changed women’s football in England","trailText":"From the national team’s first full-time manager to landmark TV deals, key steps on the way to Sunday’s final","byline":"Sophie Downey","body":"<h2><strong>The Hope Powell effect</strong></h2> <p>Powell deserves recognition as a pioneer of the sport. Her appointment as the first full-time England manager in 1998 and subsequent 15-year period at the helm were pivotal. A former player with 66 international caps, she instigated massive reform while in charge, fighting the FA for facilities, the establishment of a national pathway, and central contracts. The latter, of which there were 17 initially, gave players the chance to become full-time footballers. They are seen as one of the first steps in the sport’s professionalisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a937c5128a270272a0e718f655ccbeee1a14e51e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a937c5128a270272a0e718f655ccbeee1a14e51e/543_66_2418_1451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hope Powell’s 1998 appointment brought huge reforms to the game in England, including the establishment of a national pathway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hope Powell’s 1998 appointment brought huge reforms to the game in England, including the establishment of a national pathway.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Hosting Euro 2005</strong></h2> <p>The 2005 edition, featuring just eight teams, took place in the north-west of England. The hosts were not a major force at the time but contained star quality with the likes of Kelly Smith. They exited after the group phase, with just one win from three matches, but its audience’s interest was piqued. The then record attendance for an England home game was set at the City of Manchester Stadium for the opener, with 29,092 fans turning out.</p> <h2><strong>Arsenal </strong><strong>conquer Europe</strong></h2> <p>To this day, Arsenal remain the only English side to have won Uefa’s showpiece European tournament. Back in 2007, Vic Akers’s all-conquering side caught the headlines as they completed the quadruple, winning what was then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/apr/30/womensfootball.sport\">the Uefa Women’s Cup</a>. They were the underdogs as they faced and beat Sweden’s Umeå 1-0 in a two-legged final. It was an impressive feat from a squad that contained many England stars.

After several iterations and expansions, it turned fully professional at the start of the 2018-19 season. In addition, the WSL 2 (now the Championship) was added in 2014 to establish an improved pathway in the football pyramid. Most of the England team play in the country’s top league, touted by many as one of the most competitive in the world.</p> <h2><strong>London 2012 Olympics</strong></h2> <p>London 2012 was without doubt another spark that lit the fuse of women’s football in the UK. It was the first time a Team GB women’s football team could take part in an Olympics. They played in front of thousands across the tournament but most notably in front of 70,000 people who packed into Wembley to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/31/london-2012-team-gb-brazil\">watch them beat Brazil</a>. The slogan for London 2012 was to “Inspire a Generation” and there is no question that Team GB did just that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8283e407754957fa13e1b1d1479207656064bfa7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8283e407754957fa13e1b1d1479207656064bfa7/0_141_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Team GB fans celebrate after Steph Houghton scores against Brazil at Wembley during London 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Team GB fans celebrate after Steph Houghton scores against Brazil at Wembley during London 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hackett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Heartbreak and joy in Canada</strong></h2> <p>The 2015 tournament was the first time the Lionesses had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\">won a medal of any colour</a> at a World Cup. However, it was not the medal that caught the attention of the nation. It was the way in which they found themselves in the bronze medal match. England’s plucky underdogs faced Japan in the semi-final, losing through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\">a stoppage-time own-goal in heartbreaking fashion</a>. Tears flowed that day but back home, the nation had been enraptured by their story. Beating Germany for the medal just a few days later was the icing on the cake.</p> <h2><strong>Brands taking the leap</strong></h2> <p>For many years, the sport was crying out for investment and there was always the feeling that it would reap rewards. In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/20/barclays-womens-super-league-sponsor-record-deal-uk-fa\">Barclays became the title sponsor</a> of the WSL, a partnership that was heralded as the biggest ever brand investment in UK women’s sport. Vitality UK took on the Women’s FA Cup while Continental Tyres continued its support. The Lionesses themselves have attracted their own brands, increasing both visibility and money coming into the game.</p> <h2><strong>Breaking records at the 2019 World Cup</strong></h2> <p>A combined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/22/womens-football-prize-money-world-cup\">1.12 billion people</a> tuned into official coverage of the 2019 tournament, a record audience for the competition and another turning point in the game. It put to bed the notion that “nobody watches” women’s football with an 11.7 million peak audience at home watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/02/usa-england-womens-world-cup-match-report\">England’s 2-1 defeat by the USA</a> in the semi-finals. Moments like this had a massive knock-on effect, with national broadcasters stepping up their coverage of both domestic and national team matches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Landmark broadcast deal</strong></h2> <p>Last year the FA sealed a landmark rights deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/mar/22/a-huge-step-forward-wsl-announces-record-breaking-deal-with-bbc-and-sky\">with Sky and the BBC</a>, a three-year agreement to broadcast the WSL. The deal has brought more access to women’s football than ever before, with multiple games being shown on live TV every weekend. It is believed to be the biggest deal of its kind in any professional women’s football league in the world. Not only does it bring more eyes on women’s football, but it increases interest commercially.</p> <h2><strong>Sarina Wiegman’s appointment</strong></h2> <p>Baroness Sue Campbell described the appointment of Sarina Wiegman as “the final piece of the jigsaw”. This will be the third successive major tournament final for the England manager having reached two with the Netherlands and now one with England. Her demand for ruthlessness and high standards is widely acknowledged and the relationships she has developed with the players, giving them the freedom to be themselves on the pitch, has reaped rewards. As Campbell continued: “Her presence has pulled it all together in a way that perhaps, now we see it, we understand what’s been built.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/30/british-idlers-how-a-2012-attack-on-uks-work-ethic-could-haunt-liz-truss","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T11:00:23Z","webTitle":"British ‘idlers’: how a 2012 attack on UK’s work ethic could haunt Liz Truss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/british-idlers-how-a-2012-attack-on-uks-work-ethic-could-haunt-liz-truss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/30/british-idlers-how-a-2012-attack-on-uks-work-ethic-could-haunt-liz-truss","fields":{"headline":"British ‘idlers’: how a 2012 attack on UK’s work ethic could haunt Liz Truss","trailText":"Tory leadership frontrunner says she did not write infamous passage in Britannia Unchained, but the book’s whole tone is now jarring","byline":"Patrick Wintour","body":"<p>In an awkward moment during the first televised head-to-head Tory leadership debate, Liz Truss was challenged about a passage in the book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">Britannia Unchained</a>, which she co-authored in 2012 when she was a new intake backbencher seeking to make her mark as a next-generation Thatcherite.</p> <p>The passage in question is infamous, reading as it does: “Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.”</p> <p>To be on the side of hardworking British people has long been safe Tory territory. To assert that such people do not exist was a risky proposition.</p> <p>The passage, leaked by an eager publicist before the book’s full publication, won the authors – Truss, Dominic Raab, Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel and Chris Skidmore – the kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/17/tory-backbenchers-urge-welfare-reforms\">attention that ambitious backbenchers crave</a>, even if the book’s wider ideas about a shrunken state, national decline and enterprise got lost in the attack on the British people’s laziness and penchant for shallow cultural trash.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">Britannia Unchained: the rise of the new Tory right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book got another round of publicity when four of the authors were handed big portfolios in Boris Johnson’s first cabinet, suggesting it showed the ideological frame of his administration. The unlucky Skidmore was cast in the role of the fifth Beatle by becoming only a minister of state.</p> <p>But the mixture of despise and near contempt for the British character implicit in the fragment has clearly unnerved Truss. Challenged on it in the debate, Truss said she had not written the offending chapter, gently blaming Raab, a Rishi Sunak supporter, instead.</p> <p>Sunak said he recalled that the authors of the book took collective responsibility for its contents, a reasonable point given the way the five self-consciously offered their ideas at the time as a decisive alternative to the mushy coalition Conservatism being offered by David Cameron in harness with Nick Clegg.</p> <p>They were all members of the Free Enterprise Group, wrote a collective introduction to the book, authored a second, more policy-prescriptive second volume, After the Coalition, and altogether gave the impression of offering a cohesive tour d’horizon of where Britain needed to look for renewal.</p> <p>Given the one-dimensional nature of the Conservative leadership contest, fought entirely within the parameters of the Tory right, many of the ideas in the book will hardly appear controversial. Weakening labour laws, reducing the size of the state, lower taxes, less welfare dependency, raising parental expectations, more science in schools – these are small change at the Tory hustings. They are hardly the equivalent of floating private health insurance in liberal democratic circles, something David Laws, a Clegg acolyte, did when he contributed to The Orange Book, a similarly controversial if less cohesive work, published in 2004.</p> <p>The risk in Britannia Unchained lies not so much in individual policies shocking this current narrow electorate, but instead the whole on your own two feet tone, jarring in an era when the wider public after the pandemic and at a time of raging fuel prices have learned to see the state as a source of protection, not oppression.</p> <p>Written by the cream of the 2010 intake inhabiting largely wealthy, safe, southern English seats, the tone may also play less well in the “red wall”. MPs nursing small majorities may blanch, for instance, when they read: “We should stop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie between manufacturing and services, the north and the south, women and men. Instead, we should focus on trying to make it easier for firms to recruit people and ensuring the tax burden is less onerous.”</p> <p>The book is littered with calls for ever harsher medicine. “We must stop bailing out the reckless, avoiding all risk and rewarding laziness.” “The bald fact is that the only successful approach to poor performance has turned out to be hard work.” “The average Singaporean works two hours and 20 minutes a day longer than the average Brit.” “There is no need for managed decline, but Britain will only get there if people are willing to take the tougher options.”</p> <p>The Science Museum is scolded for trying to make its exhibitions relevant. Media studies are anathema. By contrast, Korean students are lauded for “going straight from long days at school to studying all evening and weekends”. And that is all before you get to the chapter on the work ethic. The Joy of Living this is not.

His arrival, though, is part of a more general picture of the key challengers tweaking their attacking options. Of the Big Six, only Manchester United are yet to sign a forward but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/25/cristiano-ronaldo-set-for-talks-with-manchester-united-over-future\">the Cristiano Ronaldo saga</a> could result in a major change to their front line.</p> <p>Haaland is a risk. He is clearly a footballer of astonishing potential, one of those outsized forwards who crop up infrequently and for a time make the game seem laughably simple. He has scored 78 league goals over the past three seasons; he himself has spoken of watching City and imagining how many goals he would score just like the one he got 12 minutes into his first appearance for the club, a friendly against Bayern, jabbing in a low cross from close range. But what matters for City is less whether he bangs in 30 or 40 over the campaign than whether he can provide ruthlessness in the big Champions League games in which they keep on falling just short.</p> <p>His rough edges, his idiosyncrasies, may be what allow him to do that, untethering him from the City system, making their attacking play less predictable. (Are they predictable, and is that a problem if they are? Even that is not apparent). City do have a clear pattern – there is an obvious City type of goal, the low cutback for an oncoming player – but that works in almost all circumstances, which is why they have been top scorers in each of the last five league seasons. The problem is that the circumstance in which it perhaps doesn’t work is against the very best sides in the very biggest games and, by definition, there are very few of them, meaning the data set is necessarily slight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a10a36e4f61db7e061b53db3b249f6263e7ffc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a10a36e4f61db7e061b53db3b249f6263e7ffc2/50_19_5361_3218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erling Haaland celebrates after scoring for Manchester City in last Sunday’s pre-season game against Bayern Munich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erling Haaland celebrates after scoring for Manchester City in last Sunday’s pre-season game against Bayern Munich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Casterline/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But those rough edges, his bullish self-assurance, may be what creates friction. Haaland has been open about his admiration for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/zlatan-ibrahimovic-romelu-lukaku-rivalry-new-book-adrenaline\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who lasted just one acrimonious season under Guardiola at Barcelona</a> and sneered about the “obedient little schoolboys” who comprised the rest of the squad. Haaland’s goal against Bayern was set up by Grealish and he spoke after that game of how he liked his “vibes”.</p> <p>Grealish, it seemed, was signed to add a little anarchy to the neat passing of the forward line, a balancing act he admitted he had found difficult; his interview on the final day in which he spoke of how inhibited he at times felt by the demands of the system was as revealing as anything about the compromises demanded by Guardiola’s methods. Perhaps the two can add improvisation that will raise City to greater heights, but it is a risk.</p> <p>The refashioning of Liverpool’s forward line had been anticipated for a while. Liverpool have been very efficient in recent years in identifying targets early and evolving without great ructions but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/22/sadio-mane-completes-bayern-munich-move-liverpool-35m-deal\">the loss of Sadio Mané</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/13/darwin-nunez-should-be-ideal-fit-for-liverpool-rampaging-bull\">the addition of Darwin Núñez</a> to a front three that only saw the arrival of Luis Díaz in January inevitably means uncertainty. Díaz was widely seen as having assimilated quickly but was ineffective in the Champions League final, though, and there must have been concerns about the way that Mané’s move into the centre seemed to impinge on Mohamed Salah’s form in the second half of last season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd13a8ddba4887e23ba77a9642142780fbde8515\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd13a8ddba4887e23ba77a9642142780fbde8515/0_116_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raheem Sterling has arrived at Chelsea, who loaned out Romelu Lukaku and still want to add another forward.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Sterling has arrived at Chelsea, who loaned out Romelu Lukaku and still want to add another forward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The great Soviet-era coach Valeriy Lobanovskyi observed that at the highest level the bonds between players are at least as important as the players themselves; finding a trio whose chemistry had such a mutually beneficial impact is extremely difficult. It may be that Salah, Núñez, Díaz is even greater than Salah, Roberto Firmino, Mané, but it may not.</p> <p>It may be a necessary part of their development, but Chelsea seem to have taken a step back from last season. Adding Raheem Sterling and offloading Romelu Lukaku changes the dynamic of the attack, but Chelsea want to add one other forward. That Todd Boehly has been doing the job of sporting director perhaps hasn’t helped recruitment, but repeatedly being gazumped by Barcelona, a club with no money, is an admittedly harsh lesson in the chimerical economics of modern football.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/30/tottenham-seal-deal-to-sign-richarlison-from-everton-for-initial-50m\">adding Richarlison</a>, Tottenham have added depth and variety and should have relieved some of the pressure on Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/04/arsenal-confirm-gabriel-jesus-signing-from-manchester-city\">Gabriel Jesus</a> seems a more natural fit for Mikel Arteta’s plans at Arsenal than Alexandre Lacazette ever did, even if doubts remain about his finishing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there is Ronaldo, the albatross United gleefully tied around their necks last season that, despite his best efforts, they seem unable to lose. He does not – cannot – fit Erik ten Hag’s system, and if he does somehow remain at the club, particularly given all the stories about his attitude to pressing drills in training last season, it’s hard to see how he would not be a disruptive presence.</p> <p>The contenders will be the same as ever: City or possibly Liverpool are likely to be champions and the battle for Champions League qualification will almost certainly be between the familiar six sides. But in the rejigging of forward lines there is an element of jeopardy and it is in that uncertainty that the initial fascination of this season’s title race lies.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2022/jul/30/brexit-uk-shoppers-pay-more-eu-zara-ikea-decathlon","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T11:00:23Z","webTitle":"‘Brexit to blame’: UK shoppers pay up to 50% more than those in EU","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/30/brexit-uk-shoppers-pay-more-eu-zara-ikea-decathlon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/jul/30/brexit-uk-shoppers-pay-more-eu-zara-ikea-decathlon","fields":{"headline":"‘Brexit to blame’: UK shoppers pay up to 50% more than those in EU","trailText":"From Zara to Ikea and Decathlon, stores charge more for same items, Guardian Money research finds","byline":"Patrick Collinson","body":"<p>Zara is charging British shoppers as much as 50% more than in Spain, while Decathlon partly blames Brexit for markups on e-bikes that can be up to £250 pricier in the UK than in France.</p> <p>The figures come from a snapshot survey by Guardian Money that examined prices of popular items at pan-European retailers including Ikea, Apple, JD Sports, and H&amp;M, as well as Zara and Decathlon. It compared prices in the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Ireland.</p> <p>It found that while at some retailers, such as JD Sports, prices are broadly similar across Britain and the EU countries, at others prices in the UK are markedly higher. None of the retailers had generally lower prices in the UK.</p> <p>The findings add another twist to the current UK cost of living crisis.</p> <p>Zara, Europe’s biggest clothing retailer, has some of the biggest percentage price differentials between the UK and the rest of Europe.</p> <p>A British shopper pays £49.99 for <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/linen-blend-tunic-dress-p04886242.html?v1=199219360\" title=\"\">a linen blend tunic dress</a> at one of Zara’s stores in the UK, equal to €58.70 at current exchange rates.

But in France, Spain and Italy, the price for the same item is €1,199. The e-bike buyer at Decathlon’s Brighton store is therefore paying €326 (£278) more than if they popped across the channel and bought it in Dieppe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52264765c51b9515fc8f0b259e8d35e47141a29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52264765c51b9515fc8f0b259e8d35e47141a29e/2_153_794_501/500.jpg\" alt=\"Decathlon Riverside electric hybrid bike\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Riverside electric bike at Decathlon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Decathlon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Decathlon largely blamed Brexit for the price differentials. It said: “The UK’s exit from the European Union has made it more expensive to import stock. It also meant that Decathlon UK had to expand the size of the supply team in order to deal with the additional administration, costs and duties associated with Britain’s exit from the customs union.</p> <p>“In the UK specifically, we have the obvious challenges involved in dealing with constantly changing exchange rates, coupled with the post-Brexit burden of having to pay import duties twice on a number of products (once as goods enter the EU, and again once they enter the UK).”</p> <p>The research findings were shown to Zara but the retailer declined to comment.</p> <p>The survey had substantial limitations: it only compared prices on a relatively small number of identical items at each retailer, and comparative prices for the UK are subject to change according to daily fluctuations in the euro-sterling exchange rate.</p> <p>But it was notable that shoppers in Britain are paying either significantly more, or largely the same, as shoppers elsewhere in Europe. Rarely did we find examples of prices that were lower in the UK than on the continent.</p> <p>The following is what we found when we went shopping at each retailer in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.</p> <h2><strong>Zara</strong></h2> <p>Our survey found a fairly consistent pattern of pricing, with the lowest prices in Zara’s home market of Spain, then a consistent band of prices across Euro-denominated countries, then often (although not always) higher prices in the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fe3b415f65878f0a80577fda76f8e974149008ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe3b415f65878f0a80577fda76f8e974149008ea/0_0_750_1125/667.jpg\" alt=\"Zara linen blend tunic dress\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zara’s linen blend tunic dress is £49.99 (€58.70) in the UK but in Germany, France, Italy and Ireland the price is €49.95, and in Spain it is only €39.95.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zara</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We found that for the store’s lower-price items – such as shirts – its prices in the UK were on a par with most other European locations, although higher than in Spain.</p> <p>Concerned that we were being unfair on the retailer – maybe chancing across some items that just happened to be more expensive in the UK – we trawled through multiple items at the store, and found even bigger price differentials than at first.</p> <p>Take, for example, a printed kaftan dress that sells for £79.99 at Zara in the UK – equal to €93.90. In Germany it is €69.95, and in Spain only €59.95. So British buyers are paying 56% more than the Spanish.</p> <p>However, we also found a men’s linen shirt that is £32.99 in the UK, equal to €38.73, that was €39.95 in Germany – €1.22 more expensive. But in Spain it was €29.95.</p> <p>Zara is part of the Inditex group, which includes brands such as Massimo Dutti, Pull&amp;Bear and Bershka.</p> <p>At Massimo Dutti, we found similar price differentials to Zara. A men’s wool suit blazer sells for £229 in the UK, equal to €268. But in Germany it’s only €219, and in Spain, €179. The buyer in Britain is paying €89 more than the buyer in Spain for the identical jacket.</p> <p>We don’t know why Zara and Massimo Dutti appear to charge so much more in the UK, and how much of the difference is because of Brexit, as the company declined to answer our questions. What we do know is that Inditex made a £98m profit in the UK in 2021, according to its global annual report.</p> <p>The conclusion? If you are heading to Spain this summer and have your eye on a Zara dress or top, it’s definitely worth buying it there rather than in the UK – subject to the UK’s post-Brexit customs and duties rules when you bring it back into the country.</p> <h2><strong>Decathlon</strong></h2> <p>The retailer has 47 stores across the UK, usually edge-of-town big-box outlets near companies such as Ikea. But while it is highly regarded for the quality of its own-brand sports merchandise, we found prices in Britain can be significantly higher than elsewhere in Europe.</p> <p>As noted previously, its Riverside e-bike retails in Britain for 27% more than in France or other European locations.</p> <p>There are similar price differentials on other items. For example, its standup paddleboard sells for £299 in the UK, equal to €351. But in France it is €269. France is Decathlon’s home turf but elsewhere in Europe prices are lower than in the UK. That paddleboard is €269.99 in Germany and Italy.</p> <p>Guardian Money included Ireland in the overall price survey because in many cases what is sold in Irish stores is sourced from logistics centres in the UK, so one might assume prices would be similar to the UK, plus maybe a bit extra for the additional transportation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"62875e228af99c2d6cacba274341923ddd450e89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62875e228af99c2d6cacba274341923ddd450e89/434_105_531_1190/446.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea Billy bookcase white\" width=\"446\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ikea’s Billy bookcase.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ikea</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even in Ireland, where consumers have long endured some of Europe’s highest retail prices, Dublin’s Decathlon came out cheaper than the UK – in some cases substantially so.</p> <p>Decathlon explained that Brexit, plus other factors, were behind the higher UK prices. “First and foremost, it is important to note that each Decathlon business unit operates as an independent, autonomous entity in its respective country. Decathlon has a range of very different competitors in each of the countries in which it operates, and pricing has to reflect this.”</p> <p>In relation to Ireland, the company added: “Their stock comes directly from France, and given that they are an EU member state, they are not burdened with the same additional costs as the UK.”</p> <h2><strong>Ikea</strong></h2> <p>The first item we chose to price-test was the furniture retailer’s classic product: the Billy bookcase. The basic version is £50 in the UK, equal to €58.70 at the time of the test. In Spain it was €59, and in France €59.99 – so almost no difference. But in Germany it was €55, so a few quid cheaper than the UK.</p> <p>We then moved on to a chest of drawers: the Koppang. This was £150 in the UK, equal to €176. Germany and Spain were this time significantly cheaper, at €149, or 15% cheaper than the UK, although France was higher.</p> <p>Next we examined a sofa. Ikea’s bestselling basic Klippan two-seater sofa in dark grey is £279 (€327) in the UK, but <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/klippan-2er-sofa-kabusa-dunkelgrau-s09251777/#content\" title=\"\">€259 in Germany</a> and €249 in France. So shoppers at Ikea in Britain are paying almost a third more for a basic Ikea sofa than those in France.</p> <p>We asked Ikea the same questions as we put to Zara and Decathlon. It declined to answer the questions and sent a statement instead. It said: “We are not immune to the current macroeconomic developments facing businesses, retailers and the public at large. Many Ikea countries have seen price changes; however, the changes will differ from country to country as prices are influenced not only by the raw material prices but also by transport, logistical costs and local market conditions.”</p> <h2><strong>JD Sports</strong></h2> <p>This UK company based in Bury now operates in 29 countries, with 3,300 stores.</p> <p>But don’t wait to buy your trainers on holiday – prices were very similar across the UK and elsewhere in Europe.</p> <p>For example, the Nike React Vision men’s trainers are £120 in the UK, equal to €141. But in every other European market we tested, the price was €135. So the UK price was more expensive – but only by 4%. That is the sort of gap where movements in the euro-sterling exchange rate could soon wipe out any difference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"517e50c6a0eb6ec0e2b544df4ceb291ee5e85a5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/517e50c6a0eb6ec0e2b544df4ceb291ee5e85a5a/48_137_681_326/500.jpg\" alt=\"Nike React Vision men’s trainers\" width=\"500\" height=\"239\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JD Sports prices Nike React Vision men’s trainers at £120 in the UK (€141) but in every other European market Guardian Money tested, the price was €135.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JD Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Apple</strong></h2> <p>Apple products have long been cheaper in the US than in Europe but within Europe the differences, judged by our price test, are minimal.</p> <p>We looked at the new iPhone 13 Pro Max, 6.7in, 256GB in various markets around Europe. This was the only item where the UK came out cheapest – although by only 1.5%.</p> <p>The UK price was £1,149, or €1,349. In Germany it is €20 more expensive, and in France and Spain it is €30 pricier. Inevitably we found it cheaper in the US, where it retails for just under £1,000 on current exchange rates – a saving of £150 compared with the UK.</p> <p>Apple appears to run a pricing model with small price variations across Europe, which makes it pointless for shoppers to cross borders to buy, while offering its products significantly cheaper on its home turf, the US. It did not respond to questions submitted by Guardian Money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47b6c0f186a3cda85fd0ee3f97e580aced35884e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47b6c0f186a3cda85fd0ee3f97e580aced35884e/515_359_4498_2868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone 13 Pro Max \" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Within Europe the price differences of Apple products, judged by our test, were minimal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>H&amp;M</strong></h2> <p>We found that the clothing company H&amp;M prices its goods in the UK almost identically to the rest of Europe.</p> <p>We looked first at a linen blend shirt dress, which retails in the UK stores for £39.99, equal to €46.97. In every other EU market we tested, the price was €49.99, so the shopper in Britain is saving about £3.</p> <p>We then examined some men’s cargo joggers that are £29.99 in the UK, or €35.23. In EU markets the price was €34.99, so a few cents cheaper.</p> <p>In a statement, H&amp;M said: “Our prices should be, more or less, the same across markets; however, they can differ slightly due to local taxes, cost levels and local external variables.

Using the example of a €500 suit, the HM Revenue and Customs site shows a £10.76 customs charge and an £88.24 VAT charge.</p> <p>Holidaymakers are liable for taxes and duties on all goods bought over the £390 allowance. For example, if you are bringing in a £500 laptop and a £100 watch, you will need to pay tax on the watch and the laptop.</p> <p>Navigating the rules is not easy. You have to declare where the item was made as well as where it was bought. That €500 item of adult clothing bought in Spain comes with a £99 charge if it was made outside the EU but £86.08 if made inside.</p> <p>If you live in Northern Ireland, then it’s a completely different story, with the province treated as if it is inside the EU for customs purposes. That means the tax on an item of adult clothing bought in Barcelona and taken home to Belfast is zero.</p> <p>HMRC’s website says: “You do not pay duty or tax on alcohol, tobacco and most other goods you bring in to Northern Ireland from the EU.”</p> <p>One bonus for the holidaymakers is that duty-free shopping is once again good value when visiting EU countries from Britain.</p> <p>You can bring in up to 18 litres of wine, 4 litres of spirits or 42 litres of beer duty-free into the UK.</p> <p>But getting that lot on to a Ryanair flight might be a bit of a struggle.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/30/archie-roach-australian-singer-songwriter-and-campaigner-dies-aged-66","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T10:53:49Z","webTitle":"Archie Roach, Australian songman and voice of the stolen generations, dies aged 66","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/30/archie-roach-australian-singer-songwriter-and-campaigner-dies-aged-66","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/30/archie-roach-australian-singer-songwriter-and-campaigner-dies-aged-66","fields":{"headline":"Archie Roach, Australian songman and voice of the stolen generations, dies aged 66","trailText":"Tributes pour in for musician whose song Took the Children Away became the anthem of the stolen generations","byline":"Andrew Stafford","body":"<p>Archie Roach, the Indigenous Australian songwriter whose celebrated song <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/13/archie-roachs-took-the-children-away-how-one-heartbreaking-song-galvanised-a-nation\">Took the Children Away</a> brought national attention to the story of the stolen generations, has died aged 66.</p> \n<p>Roach died at Warrnambool Base hospital after a long illness, surrounded by his family and loved ones.</p> \n<p>“We are heartbroken to announce the passing of Gunditjmara (Kirrae Whurrong/Djab Wurrung), Bundjalung Senior Elder, songman and storyteller Archie Roach,” his sons Amos and Eban Roach announced in a statement on behalf of the Roach family.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/30/archie-roach-obituary\">Archie Roach obituary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“We thank all the staff who have cared for Archie over the past month.

In November 2019 Roach’s album Tell Me Why – a companion piece to his autobiography – became his first to reach the national top 10.</p> \n<p>Roach was also a political force and leader, who fought tirelessly to draw attention to the history of, and inequity facing, Indigenous Australia. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2015 for his services to music and social justice, and was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association’s Hall of Fame in 2020. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/12/archie-roach-reveals-he-was-critically-ill-during-arias-performance\">He was gravely ill at the time of his induction</a>, and performed with his medical team and an ambulance on standby.</p> \n<p>Roach was born in the central Victorian town of Mooroopna on 8 January 1956, the youngest of seven siblings.

Roach later described them as “blameless, as far as I’m concerned. They were used.” While at school, he briefly attended a Pentecostal church, where he learned hymns, and he was also introduced to the music of Hank Williams.

But their lives over the next 15 years were blighted by alcoholism and homelessness as they drifted between Victoria and South Australia. Roach suffered from severe epilepsy and survived one suicide attempt. Soon after, Hunter briefly left him. This proved the catalyst for Roach to turn his life around.</p> \n<p>In his memoir, Roach wrote that “empathy was my impetus”. He brought all of it to his songwriting, which was beginning to blossom. He first performed Took the Children Away at a Bicentenary protest in Sydney on 25 January 1988. “People were stunned,” he wrote. “Women were crying. Men had their heads bowed, shoulders heaving.”</p> \n<p>Roach was stunned, too, unaware that the story of his family was shared by so many in the audience. He was invited to play on ABC Radio National and then on the television show Blackout. The late Steve Connolly, guitarist with Paul Kelly’s band, saw this performance and Kelly invited Roach to open for him at the Melbourne Concert Hall (now Hamer Hall).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/25/paul-kelly-the-crowd-was-stunned-into-silence-after-archie-roach-sang-took-the-children-away\">Roach’s two-song set opening for Kelly had an equally profound impact on the mostly white audience</a>. After performing Took the Children Away, the hall was silent, then, as Roach began to walk off, the full house erupted in applause. Kelly and Connolly later produced Roach’s debut, Charcoal Lane, which also featured Hunter’s song Down City Streets.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/13/archie-roachs-took-the-children-away-how-one-heartbreaking-song-galvanised-a-nation\">Archie Roach’s Took the Children Away: how one heartbreaking song galvanised a nation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The album went gold, with Roach winning Arias for best new talent and best Indigenous release. Took the Children Away won an International Human Rights Achievement award in 1992. On 13 February 2008 he performed the song in Federation Square, Melbourne, after the then-prime minister, Kevin Rudd, delivered a national apology to the stolen generations.</p> \n<p>Roach had suffered from ill health for the last decade. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/15/archie-roach-on-performing-a-day-after-his-partners-funeral-we-got-through-it-i-dont-know-how\">After Hunter’s death in 2010</a> he had a stroke. Though he recovered and returned to live performance only six months later, he was soon diagnosed with lung cancer, and had half a lung removed. He had already given up a kidney in an unsuccessful transplant to one of his brothers.</p> \n<p>In October 2020 he launched the Archie Roach Stolen Generation Educational Resources, a free package of educational support materials developed by First Nations curriculum writers to teach young Australians about Indigenous Australia, cultural identity and the stolen generations.

And if you don’t know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/thailand-cave-rescue\">what happened next</a>, you must have been living in your own personal cave during the 18-day search-and-rescue operation. But despite the fact that we all know the outcome, and that it’s the third film in as many years to tell the story, Ron Howard’s account of the drama is compulsively watchable and breathlessly tense.</p> <p>This version of the events, which stars Viggo Mortensen as laconic British cave diver Rick Stanton and Colin Farrell as his biscuit-hoarding fellow expert John Volanthen, follows the Bafta-nominated 2021 documentary <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/31/the-rescue-review-thai-cave-rescue-documentary-free-solo-directors\">The Rescue</a></em>.

The cave divers are key figures, but the film also follows the contribution of Thai groundwater specialist Thanet Natisri (Nophand Boonyai). It weaves in the Thai navy Seals, the children’s families, and touches on the political backdrop. The rescue, <em>Thirteen Lives</em> stresses, was a team effort; and likewise this thrilling piece of film-making.

My dad was managing a local club, and I was brought along for good luck. My family say I’ve been a fan ever since.</p> <p>I’ve been to hundreds of matches, and attended 40 of the 92 English league grounds. I’ve been to the Asian Super Cup final in Japan, as well as games in China, Germany and Poland. But there’s something unique about seeing our English Lionesses reach the final of the Euros.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89ff798d3d42c14dd043c411e31b71bf168d8a4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ff798d3d42c14dd043c411e31b71bf168d8a4c/0_0_1536_2048/750.jpg\" alt=\"Bryony Rowan as a baby\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Some of my best childhood memories are of watching my mum play for Bradford City.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryony Rowan as a baby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I come from a footballing family, so it’s not surprising I’m such a passionate supporter. My mum and dad have an England flag standing proudly outside their bedroom window for this weekend’s match, and I tried for five hours – ultimately, unsuccessfully – to get a ticket to Wembley.</p> <p>Some of my best childhood memories are of watching my mum play for Bradford City, a top team at a time when women’s “professional” football didn’t exist. My dad played, too, for Crewe’s developmental team, so all of us always saw football as a sport for everyone. As a 10-year-old, I remember chatting tactics with my dad’s friends, and my opinion counted just as much as anyone else’s.</p> <p>But I recognise that my experience was at odds with my peers. Growing up, my dad would take me to Huddersfield Town matches. I was completely swept up by the buzz of the crowd and the camaraderie between the fans. But even if there were sometimes other girls in attendance with their dads, I rarely saw mums or groups of women. When we would go to watch my mum play, even though Bradford City were in the Women’s Premier League National Division – the highest level in women’s football at the time – there was no fan culture that you would typically associate with professional sport. Supporters were friends and family. But the men’s games seemed to cultivate the most loyal followings, even the obscure ones. At school, even though I was mad about the game, I never bothered chatting football with the boys; I knew I’d be disrespected despite my encyclopedic knowledge.</p> <p>I know how exclusionary football can be to women and girls. For that reason alone, it’s impossible to overstate just how significant Sunday’s Euros final will be. It could be the watershed moment female fans and players have waited for, as the UK is finally forced to wake up en masse to the fact that football is for women too.</p> <p>Millions will be tuning in, including men who have never really acknowledged that women’s teams exist before, let alone supported them. Anecdotally, the reason seems to be simple: the truth is that the Lionesses’ talent is impossible to ignore. The team displays good, old-fashioned sportspersonship at its finest. They have conceded one goal since the group stages; in their game against Norway they scored six goals in one half, which had never been done before at the Euros. These women are smashing records, they have got the skill level, the professionalism, the personalities – what is the excuse to <em>not</em> support them at this point?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2edf1f0066aad31569e21accd282a9825699c1bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2edf1f0066aad31569e21accd282a9825699c1bb/0_0_750_1334/562.jpg\" alt=\"Bryony Rowan with her dad\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Growing up, my dad would take me to Huddersfield Town matches.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryony Rowan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Too many girls still grow up believing that football is a sport for boys. But now, regardless of the messaging they may receive, girls will be able to watch women play from the stands or at home. You can’t overstate just how seismic that will be. If girls can see it, they can be it. I’m a diehard Huddersfield supporter, which has always been a family-friendly club, and as a child (and now a young woman), I’ve always felt welcomed as a female supporter. That makes a huge difference, because formative experiences matter.</p> <p>It’s hard to describe just how good it feels to be swept up in a summer of football frenzy with women at the heart of our national pride. The Euros could be our opportunity to create a lasting legacy that transforms the way women’s sport is received across the board. But to be successful, we need to understand that change is not galvanised on positive feelings alone.</p> <p>Women’s football urgently needs investment, strategy and planning. We need resources to not only get women into football, but also to keep them there. This is no longer a men’s game, and we need to recognise that there are already excellent female players, coaches and physios who don’t have the recognition they deserve. And I’m not just talking about sponsorship. It’s vital we also make women’s games more accessible and affordable if we want to increase crowd numbers – ticket prices and match locations have to be better considered to have any hope of transforming football into a game for all.</p> <p>The Lionesses have captured the hearts and imaginations of girls across the country. I’m hopeful that their dedication will set us on an unstoppable path for change that will make everyone see that the women’s game is just as worthy as the men’s in its own right – and worth shouting about from the rooftops.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bryony Rowan is a PhD student and Huddersfield Town supporter.

The narrator is a translator of German fiction and part-time classics lecturer at a London university, living in lockdown with her increasingly distressed 10-year-old son and her increasingly withdrawn partner Jason, who is drinking increasing quantities of alcohol. Her time is divided between trying to care for and home-school her son, trying to do her work and trying not to spend too much time on Twitter. None of these endeavours is particularly successful.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she’s thinking about the future and particularly about her proposed book on ancient Greek techniques of prophecy. Each chapter heading introduces a way of divining the future – Rhapsodomancy: Prophecy by Poetry; Ololygmancy: Prophesy by the Howling of Dogs; Urticariomancy: Prophecy by Itches, and so on. Often we get a brief account of the Greek method, but sometimes just another day in lockdown. “I am sick of the future,” the book begins. “Up to here with the future. I don’t want anything to do with it; don’t want it near me.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Based on current plausible prognostications (Prophecy by Science?), this is a reasonable position. We all know what’s coming for us and our children and we all know who to blame; what is a novelist to do, how should narrative proceed, when the only question left is exactly how fast the end is approaching? It’s all here, “that dystopian future of surveillance, video calls and VR headsets, and viral epidemics spread by globalisation, and the 24-hour news saying AI extinction event gene-modification the collapse of civilisation”. (What, no climate change?)</p> <p>One of the problems for realist fiction in 2022 is that the end of the world as we know it proceeds shapelessly, without much by way of plot or narrative structure but with an obvious and looming ending. It’s hard to craft an elegantly structured novel that admits our widely shared sense of living in the end times, which is presumably why some writers are persisting along parallel tracks with fiction set in a fantasy, Covid-free version of the last three years. Delphi is not the book for readers still hoping to participate in this grand repression, but for anyone looking for ways of thinking creatively and with love about art in an emergency and what just happened to us all I would recommend it, because despite the bleakness – you can’t have realism without bleakness now – this is clever, warm and funny writing.</p> <p>Finding her husband playing Candy Crush when he has shut himself in the study and declared himself unavailable for childcare or housework because of urgent and overwhelming work commitments, the narrator furiously recounts her own afternoon: “barely got a couple of hours on my translation, then had to drive back out to pick Xander up at 3.15 and admire some cereal boxes that had undergone, frankly, the bare minimum of intervention, drive back via Tesco and the garage, make Xander’s tea then prep ours, play football with him in the garden, wash up – OK, I’m boring myself now … ” Jason is playing Candy Crush Saga. “Saga? As in a long and complex narrative, possibly written in Old Norse?” He’s too absorbed in the game to respond: “I realise that if Jason had an affair I would be able to forgive the sex but I would never ever be able to forgive him the time.”</p> <p>Between the domestic dark comedy, the narrator thinks about narratives of the future, and particularly narratives of the future from the past. What do we want to know, what do we not want to know, what do we have to believe to keep going and how much do we want to know the truth of what we have to believe? Meanwhile, the ancient Greek gods bargain, curse and fight in the background because, while the action, as in any lockdown story, is limited, the narrator’s head is a busy and unusual place echoing with voices from long ago as well as Twitter’s prophecies of doom. This isn’t exactly a comfortable book, but it has the consolations of proper thinking and good writing.</p> <p><em>• </em>Delphi by Clare Pollard is published by Fig Tree (£12.99).

It’s not just due to confirmation bias – the tendency to seize ideas that validate our views, while dismissing information that challenges them. It’s also because of distance. We’re often too close to our own arguments to evaluate them critically. To recognise our blind spots, we need other people to hold up a mirror.

I asked him if he could help me identify flaws in my reasoning about the benefits of them. He quickly pointed out that when I said, “Vaccines are safe and effective,” I was parroting a narrative. How safe? How effective? He was right. I had fallen victim to what psychologists call <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/black-white-thinking-burden-binary-brain-complex-world-bookbite/26648__;!!IBzWLUs!UmTW0U_pPif7aySsM2TmRv3ESZuzewqsyogxDiooQTCTdyjFWGr6ea1kDEB1Izq-fJKg_Mz9nI5JDWyElT-n7rmXxY_KDYYW$\" title=\"\">binary bias</a>.

Before the discussion, they read<strong> </strong>one of two versions of an article on a different issue: guns. A simple edit to the article was enough to boost their odds of finding common ground on abortion from 46% to 100%. In the first version, the gun issue was presented as a war between two camps; in the second, it was framed as a complex issue that could be seen through many different sides of a prism. There were plenty of conservatives who favoured universal background checks for gun ownership, and quite a few liberals who supported the right to bear arms. Once people saw the shades of grey on guns, they came to the abortion conversation with a more open mind.</p> <p>I needed to bring that complexity into my arguments. I asked my friend how he would weigh the benefits against the costs of vaccines. To my surprise, we agreed on the standards. We’d have to weigh the probability and severity of Covid-19 against the probability and severity of adverse effects from vaccines. When I sent him some initial evidence showing that the benefits outweighed the risks, he said my view was biased. Instead of making one-sided arguments, I should be questioning the status quo. I told him the goal isn’t to challenge a narrative – it’s to find the truth.</p> <p><strong>Agree on your approach to arguing</strong></p> <p>In conflict-mediation training, I learned that if you want to have a good argument, it helps to take a step back and talk about <em>how</em> you argue. I told my friend that before debating the facts, we should discuss how to assess them. A balanced argument doesn’t weigh two sides equally – it gives more weight to the strongest evidence. He was trying to use a chart implying a weak correlation between vaccination rates and mortality to debunk the results of multiple randomised controlled trials. He said the results of these trials could be exaggerated by scientists with incentives to promote vaccines, and that adverse events might be suppressed by big pharma and the government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</figcaption> </figure>  <p>My friend had helped me see the selective laziness of my reasoning. Now I had an opportunity to help him spot a hole in his. I asked if he believed the Earth is round. He said yes. I asked him to consider what it would look like if he evaluated evidence on the shape of the Earth the same way he does vaccines. He might say physicists are biased and astronauts are paid to lie. He might insist on seeing it with his own eyes. I followed up with another question. Even if he could see a round Earth from space, who’s to say it isn’t an optical illusion? The Earth is spinning, but your eyes (and inner ears) tell you it’s standing still. I acknowledged that he has some valid concerns about vaccines, and that I share some of them. But I worry that on this issue, he’s more in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2019/feb/05/flat-earth-rising-meet-the-people-casting-aside-2500-years-of-science-video\" title=\"\">Flat Earther</a> camp than the science camp. For the first time in our 30-year friendship, he said: “I see what you’re saying.”</p> <p>People who are sceptical of scientific evidence on one issue rarely deny it across the board. Climate change deniers put their faith in physics each time they board a plane. Vaccine sceptics show their trust in medicine whenever they take an antibiotic.</p> <p><strong>Build up to the really toxic topics</strong></p> <p>The stronger your convictions, the harder it is to recognise your biases. Finding an issue where views are less extreme can create some distance. I didn’t have to attack my friend’s conclusions, I just had to help him reflect on his own thought process. A few months later, he proposed that we should switch sides on the debate. He sent me a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/pdfs/mm7104e2-H.pdf\" title=\"\">study</a> suggesting that, compared with people who were vaccinated and boosted, unvaccinated people had a risk more than 13 times greater of being infected with Covid – and more than 53 times greater of dying from it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The highest compliment from someone who disagrees with you is not ‘You were right.’ It’s ‘You made me think.’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e65c9849d08187a6e725d5a84317be6abf29a8b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e65c9849d08187a6e725d5a84317be6abf29a8b6/0_0_769_1333/577.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a woman holding out her hands in frustration\" width=\"577\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The highest compliment from someone who disagrees with you is not, “You were right.” It’s “You made me think.” Good arguments help us recognise complexity where we once saw simplicity.

As adults, we often shy away from minor disagreements with our partners. The risk is that we never prepare for the major ones. Arguing well is like learning to balance on a tightrope.

If you only argue when the stakes are high, your emotions are running too hot to think and learn. Practising small fights is how you train for the big ones.

Sir Brian Langstaff said infected people and bereaved partners should be given “payments of no less than £100,000”.</p> <p>Des Collins, a senior partner at Collins Solicitors, which represents some of the victims, said he would be dialling up the pressure on the government on Monday, after Boris Johnson was urged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/10/pay-contaminated-blood-scandal-victims-before-they-die-boris-johnson-urged\">to pay the interim amounts to those affected at once and before more of them die</a>. The recommendation for immediate payments was backed by the former health secretaries Jeremy Hunt, Matt Hancock and Andy Burnham.</p> <p>At least 2,400 people died after contracting HIV or hepatitis C as a result of receiving infected blood from the NHS in the 1970s and 1980s, and as many as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/24/infected-blood-inquiry-hears-evidence-hiv-hepatitis-c\">30,000 people became severely ill</a>. The scandal has been labelled the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.</p> <p>An open letter to the prime minister this month signed by organisations including the Haemophilia Society and the Terrence Higgins Trust said 419 people had died between July 2017, when the inquiry was announced, and February this year. It said it had been reported that one infected person was dying every four days.</p> <p>Ros Cooper, who was infected with hepatitis C after being given infected blood products as a child, described the news of the interim recommendation as an “extraordinary development”. Cooper told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think it is evidence of just how much has been uncovered that would back up this request.”</p> <p>Cooper, who began receiving blood clotting factor products when she was less than six months old, said being infected with hepatitis C had left her unable to work. “It’s been the controlling factor in my life since I found out as a teenager that I got it,” Cooper said. She said she had suffered mental health problems and fatigue: “The mental side-effects of being told you’re going to die in your 20s have been huge.”</p> <p>She added that it had been “compounded” by having “to fight ever since then, to try and get some level of acknowledgment of justice from successive governments”.</p> <p>Hunt echoed Collins, calling for the payments to all the victims and bereaved partners be made “right away”. Appearing on the Today programme, he called on ministers to act before more victims died.</p> <p>“I just would urge ministers to recognise that time is of the essence and just waiting, you know, a couple of months until, for example, the leadership campaign is resolved and the new prime minister has made the decision will mean that a few more people are likely to have died,” he said.</p> <p>“We should do it right away. We’ve waited far too long. Successive governments, which I was part of one, didn’t act as quickly as they should have and we need to recognise this as a terrible, terrible injustice.”</p> <p>Hancock said the government had a “moral duty” to compensate victims of the scandal and said he was “confident” it would.

Neither does the Democratic president, Joe Biden, nor do a good number of economists.</p> <p>And yet, many Americans appear to believe the world’s largest economy is in a recession, creating yet another liability for Biden in the run-up to November’s midterm elections, where voters are already inclined to hand Republicans control of at least one chamber of Congress.</p> <p>The case for the country experiencing a contraction was bolstered on Thursday when the Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/us-economy-gdp-second-quarter\">reported the economy shrank for the second straight quarter</a>, a worrying data point that doesn’t satisfy the technical definition of a recession, but nonetheless underscores the damage done by snarled global supply chains and America’s continuing bout of high inflation.</p> <p>“It suggests, overall, the economy is weakening, it’s certainly losing steam, where there are storm clouds not only on the horizon but we’re entering them right now,” said James W Hughes, dean emeritus of the Edward J Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. “But I don’t think it’s clear whether we’re in a recession right now.”</p> <p>Biden attempted to downplay the data after its release, saying that a growth slowdown is “no surprise” after the US economy expanded rapidly last year and made up ground from the record collapse caused by Covid-19 in 2020.</p> <p>“Even as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure,” Biden said in a statement that called for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/28/climate-bill-joe-manchin-whats-in-it\">a compromise bill Democrats announced this week</a> to fund party priorities such as lowering healthcare costs and fighting climate change, while also reducing the federal budget deficit.</p> <p>The Republican chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, appeared inclined to agree. The central bank has spent much of this year raising interest rates to keep prices in check, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/fed-increase-interest-rates-inflation\">on Wednesday announced another big increase</a>.</p> <p>“I do not think the US is currently in a recession and the reason is there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,” Powell said, speaking the day before the GDP data was released.</p> <p>But to Republicans, the report was all the proof they needed that the economy is on the decline, and that the president is to blame. Indeed, they had a moniker at the ready: “Joe Biden’s recession”.</p> <p>“Biden and Democrats are responsible for our shrinking economy, and they’re only trying to make it worse,” the Republican National Committee chair, Ronna McDaniel, said.</p> <p>Their announcement wasn’t exactly correct.</p> <p>While many countries consider two consecutive quarters of economic contraction to be a recession, in the US, the private National Bureau of Economic Research makes the call, and <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions\">defines it</a> as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months”.</p> <p>Surveys indicate Americans aren’t waiting for those economists to weigh in.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/\">University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index</a>, which measures Americans’ views of the economy, hit its lowest point ever in June. Though it rebounded slightly in July, the survey’s figure is lower than even April 2020, when Covid-19 had cost more than 20 million people their jobs and the unemployment rate hit 14.7%.</p> <p>“It’s shock, after shock, after shock and we’re in an environment where these shocks are affecting morale,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at the consultancy EY-Parthenon. The disruptions include the past year and a half of rising inflation, the sharp uptick in gas prices in 2022 and the Covid-19 pandemic itself, particularly the new variants that have hampered the return of everyday life.</p> <p>All of that has sucked the cheer out of what would normally be a critical asset for the Biden administration: low unemployment. The jobless rate was 3.6% in June, near where it was before the pandemic, and the economy has added hundreds of thousands of jobs in recent months.</p> <p>To Daco, the question of why the economy is where it is can’t be answered by the actions of one man.</p> <p>“I don’t think you can really put the blame on any administration when it comes to the state of the economy, especially when you have a shock” like the Covid-19 pandemic, he said. “That blame game doesn’t really serve much purpose.”</p> <p>Voters nonetheless seem ready to take their frustration out on Biden. A <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22088874-cnn-poll-biden-approval-rating\">SSRS poll conducted for CNN</a> and released earlier in July found only 30% of respondents agreed with his handling of the economy, and just 38% approved of his job performance in general.</p> <p>The poll aggregator <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/\">FiveThirtyEight</a> puts the odds of the Democrats losing control of the House of Representatives as high, and they may also become the minority in the Senate. The Republicans waiting to take over leadership of Congress’s lower house are said to be <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/19/hunter-biden-gop-2023-00046419\">planning investigations</a> of the first two years of Biden’s presidency, including the inflation wave.</p> <p>Consumer prices have climbed 9.1% for the 12 months until June, a rate not seen since the early 1980s. The forces pushing them up are myriad, and include the Fed’s zero interest rate policies during the Covid-19 downturn, the government’s attempts to rescue the economy by sending consumers money and the global supply chain disruptions that remain from the days of pandemic lockdowns, which have been worsened by new shocks to oil and food markets caused by the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>Much has been made of Biden’s policies in 2021, particularly the $1.9tn American Rescue Plan, which was intended to jolt the economy’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic by again sending Americans stimulus checks, and also aiding unemployed workers and local governments.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/20/jane-timken/bidens-american-rescue-plan-fueled-inflation-so-di/\">Economists differ</a> over how much that package added to inflation. William Spriggs, chief economist of the AFL-CIO trade union federation, sees it as one of the few things keeping the economy going.</p> <p>“People have been able to spin the story, with the help of economists, that the inflation is Biden’s fault,” he said. Instead, Spriggs credited the American Rescue Plan with giving consumers the funds to continue spending, even as the economy contracted in the second quarter of this year.</p> <p>With its power to raise interest rates and drive up costs for mortgages, car loans and other sorts of debt, the Fed is the most powerful inflation fighter in Washington.

At 9am on a Monday in springtime, it’s already buzzing with activity. Well-groomed pedigree dogs tow their well-groomed pedigree owners around on long leads; joggers and power walkers are out in force; wading birds busily forage on the foreshore. On a clear day you can see all the way to Corfe Castle across the world’s second-largest natural harbour (after Sydney, Australia). It’s a bit hazy today, but still the view, which is central to this case, is pretty good.</p> <p>And yet Whitecliff Park is the scene of two shocking double murders. Most recently, during the night of 15 February, an attack left two dead on Turks Lane, along the southeastern edge of the park. Six months earlier, two much-loved elderly residents – fine, upstanding pillars of the community – were poisoned to death on Whitecliff Road, at the top of the park. In a statement Dorset Police said: “Officers carried out inquiries into these incidents; however, no arrests have been made.”</p> <p>It could have been worse: the victims could have been people. They are – were – trees: two sycamores and a pair of English oaks. John Challinor, who chairs the local Parkstone Bay Residents Association, still considers it murder, though. “If you deliberately kill, that’s murder, isn’t it?” he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec2026af2a8dc6694fece90a6a12f27e2cf2a497\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec2026af2a8dc6694fece90a6a12f27e2cf2a497/0_219_6651_3991/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The two dead oaks in Whitecliff Park, Poole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The two dead oaks in Whitecliff Park, Poole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We’ll come to Challinor, and the sycamores. But first to those oaks, which Steve Cox calculates were around 80 years old. Cox used to be the council’s senior tree officer; now he runs an aboricultural consulting firm in Poole. He has worked with the trees around here for more than 20 years. He points up to the branches of the neighbouring trees in the line of oaks bursting into life, then at two dark skeletons that will never wake from winter again.</p> <p>We go closer, up to the trunk of one of them, where Cox points out a small dark circle, about a metre above the ground, and another, and another – five or six in total, around the trunk. The same marks are on the other tree. Drill holes. A twig poked into one of them goes in about 10cm, angled downwards. That’s where the poison was injected. Most probably a horticultural glyphosate herbicide such as Roundup, he reckons, but he’s heard of bleach and diesel being used. You don’t need a chainsaw to kill a tree and the internet will quickly tell you how.</p> <p>Cox explains that the drill holes take the poison into the live vessels in the most recent few years of growth, under the bark. “The wood cells are oriented vertically, so each one of those vessels is a long tube connecting the root system to the leaves, sucking up nutrients and water the whole time. If you drill into those vessels and introduce a poison, that can disrupt the tree’s transport system and its growth processes to the extent that the tree dies. You’re disrupting the connection between the root and the leaf. If it was Roundup, it’s designed to go down into the root system as well as up, so it’s a very effective way of killing a tree.” Put like that, it certainly sounds like murder.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who would benefit from these trees dying? People who would get an improved view of the harbour</p> <footer> <cite> </cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cox is down to earth, matter of fact, practical. He knows that in urban areas the relationship between trees and humans can be a delicate balance, and it needs to be managed, but he will list the benefits of trees at any opportunity. “We know they’re providing oxygen and taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, soaking up water, reducing storm surge levels, filtering pollution from the air. Trees are fabulous organisms that do all of those things effortlessly, it seems.”</p> <p>Does he love trees? “Yeah. Trees have given me a career. I love spending time with them and learning about them. Our work can be stressful, but also I’m looking at trees, which is therapy.” As well as loving the trees here in Dorset, he has lived and worked with trees in Cameroon and the Solomon Islands and has written a book on urban tree management (as well as a novel). I think if you drilled into Cox, sap might come out, and if you sawed him in half there would be rings: 63 of them.</p> <p>To a motive, then. “You’ve got to ask who would benefit from these trees dying and it’s people who would get an improved view of the harbour,” says Cox, looking up from the base of the trees to the houses behind, on Whitecliff Road. They’re mostly newbuilds, and of a certain style: lots of glass, big, brash and boxy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6a152946586cb02eb46f6ba8efe6a1a6a9446a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6a152946586cb02eb46f6ba8efe6a1a6a9446a9/0_419_6616_3970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arboricultural consultant Steve Cox\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arboricultural consultant Steve Cox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don’t find anyone at home in the house directly behind the dead trees, but you could say that several houses might benefit from their removal, including a development under construction further back. A little way along the road, a couple washing their cars say they heard about the trees but they’ve only just moved in. Anyway, it doesn’t affect them – the oaks don’t go this far along; they’ve got some low scrubby bushes in front of them, which they like because they screen the playground in the park without taking away the harbour view. No, they wouldn’t like to give their names.</p> <p>How much is a view worth? A lot, around here. A house with a good view on Whitecliff Road can go for £2m-£2.5m, says Adrian Dunford, director of Tailor Made estate agents up the road in Sandbanks, where the houses sell for even more. “A house with no view there? Probably £1.5m. A house with a tree in front of it has probably got a partial view, but the gain in value by removing the tree might be about 20%.” Not bad for a quiet night’s work, with a drill and a bottle of Roundup.</p> <p>Of course the trees also play a big part in making the area so desirable. “It’s that sylvan setting,” says Dunford, slipping into estate-agent speak. “The tranquility of being surrounded by trees, and having tree-lined avenues, it all adds to the pleasure of living in the area.” Just with a hefty dollop of Not-In-My-Front-Garden. “There’s always been a pressure to remove trees in order to gain more housing development, or to make a house larger, or to improve a view,” he says.</p> <p>Cox has never known a prosecution for an attack on a tree in a public space, which is classed as vandalism. Nick Perrins, current head of planning at BCP council which covers Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, says it’s hard “unless you’ve got some evidence from CCTV cameras, or someone’s seen it.” No one is surprised that no arrests have been made for the Whitecliff Park killings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</figcaption> </figure>  <p>You’re much more likely to get caught killing a tree on your own land. Trees on private land are often protected by Tree Preservation Orders made by the local authority. A TPO is a recognition that a tree has some presence in the locality and provides some public amenity. A TPO map of the Poole area shows thousands of individual trees marked. “Trees are a really important part of the character of our area, they’re a key part of why it’s so beautiful and special,” Nick Perrins tells me. Unauthorised pruning or felling of protected trees is a criminal offence that can lead to prosecution.</p> <p>Of course, attacks on trees on both private and public land aren’t limited to one affluent corner of Dorset. It’s difficult to put numbers to the issue, because some of it just comes under vandalism, and records of TPO breaches are kept by local authorities, of which there are 333 in England alone. A trawl of local papers and websites throws up incidents in Newlyn in Cornwall or Beverley in Yorkshire, and any number of other places. But a day spent with Steve Cox confirms that Poole is certainly a hotspot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now, the tree is gone – poisoned not by Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un but by a retired accountant</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After inspecting the poisoned oaks at Whitecliff, Cox takes me on a little tour of some other recent crime scenes in the area. To the Lilliput district first, and a large detached house on a road called Avalon. The owner, a retired accountant named Robert Page, had agreed to sell the property to a developer who was going to knock it down and build a block of luxury flats. But the lucrative deal fell through when planning was refused, one of the reasons being a 20-metre Monterey Pine in the garden. The 65-year-old tree, described as “huge and historic”, had been under a tree protection order since 1989. Page applied to have the tree felled, claiming it was a risk, but this was turned down, too.</p> <p>Guess what? Not long afterwards the hitherto healthy tree began to wither and die. Cox’s company was involved in the council investigation, which found that herbicide had been injected into drill holes and concrete poured around the roots, and led to prosecution. Now, the tree is gone: it eventually toppled on to the roof of a garage block during Storm Arwen last November. But its ghost lives on in Google Maps street view, blackened and shrivelled, poisoned not by Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un but by a retired accountant.</p> <p>At the trial at Salisbury Crown Court in December, Nick Cotter, prosecuting, told the jury: “When you start placing the evidence together it becomes like dead wood on the shoulders of Mr Page, weighing him down.” Page claimed a vigilante had come onto his property and killed the tree. The jury said that was rubbish. Sentencing him, Judge Robert Pawson branded Page “arrogant”, said he had “murdered” the Monterey Pine, and “lied through his teeth over its demise”. He went on: “That tree cast a literal shadow over your house and garden. Now that tree casts a metaphorical shadow over you and your family.” I think Judge Pawson might have quite enjoyed that one.</p> <p>Page was found guilty, and ordered to pay £80,000: £25,000 in court costs, five grand for the loss in public benefit, and perhaps most significantly, £50,000 for the amount his property had gained in value through the loss of the tree.</p> <p>“We’ve always had a pretty good record of taking action where needed,” says the council’s Nick Perrins. “Everyone understands the trees are special – therefore we tend to have people reporting things to the council, and we will respond to them.” You might think you can get away with cutting down that yew you don’t like in your own garden, but your neighbour may well dob you in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Poole is the tree murder capital of Britain. The leafier and wealthier parts of Poole, anyway</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next, we’re off to Sandbanks proper, home to some of Britain’s most expensive real estate, and another crime scene. In 2019, businessman Trevor Beale had two Scots pines hacked back at the rear of his luxury home because they shaded his patio and balconies. One of the trees was actually in his neighbour’s garden. Beale claimed an overzealous tree surgeon had got carried away, but pleaded guilty to two charges of contravening tree preservation regulations. He was fined £2,700, plus £15,000 court costs, and the judge ordered him to pay back £40,500, the calculated value Beale’s crime had added to his property.</p> <p>And there’s more: a £7,500 fine for a man who tried over a year to kill a large pine tree in his mother’s Sandbanks garden by pouring Jeyes fluid over it; attacks on the trees along Panorama Road – the list goes on. Everyone I speak to here thinks it’s a big issue in the area, and getting bigger. I’m going to come out and say it: Poole is the tree murder capital of Britain. The leafier and wealthier parts of Poole, anyway. And I wonder if there’s a connection, between the wealth and the tree crime. “Trees are such a big issue in this area,” says Cox. “There are so many of them and so many people, and the people have got a lot of money. If it was a destitute area there would be less money thrown at the issue.”</p> <p>John Challinor – chair of the Parkstone Bay Residents Association, remember – agrees. “You get some people who feel, quite frankly: I’ve got some money, I can do what I like.’” I’ve returned to Whitecliff Harbourside Park to see the remains of its two other victims – young sycamores felled during the night of 15 February. Challinor, along with local councillor Ann Stribley, and Michele Beesley of the Whitecliff volunteers group, have brought me to where they stood, now just a couple of sorry stumps, about 15cm across. The cuts are quite smooth; Stribley thinks they were felled using a handsaw. “There were no bits – a chainsaw always leaves bits. And no one heard a thing.” Stribley, who has represented the area for more than 40 years, says attacks on trees are definitely on the increase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"662f7749c5dcc5f34c81d83ab056219fbf58c362\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/662f7749c5dcc5f34c81d83ab056219fbf58c362/0_894_4262_5328/800.jpg\" alt=\"The remains of one of the sycamores on Turks Lane, Poole.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The remains of one of the sycamores on Turks Lane, Poole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“When I saw what had happened, I was appalled,” says Beesley, who has lived here since 1956 and walks in the park every day. “I couldn’t believe anyone would have the nerve to do that. It’s vandalism. We have enough trouble with youths and antisocial behaviour – actually, this is worse: how can you expect them to behave if adults are doing this?”</p> <p>“We pay council tax,” says Challinor. “The council works hard to maintain really lovely outside spaces for people, and then someone decides they don’t care, they’d rather have a nice view. It’s selfish, whether it’s a homeowner or a developer – either way, it’s purely for their own gain.”</p> <p>For Stribley, blocking the view was one of benefits of the trees, but she is looking in the other direction. “To block the view of the horrid houses,” she says, with a shudder. Not a fan of boxy, brash architecture, I think.</p> <p>The houses along Turks Lane behind the sycamore stumps are indeed boxy newbuilds, more modest than some I’ve seen today. The most recent to sell went for a mere £1.25m. None of them benefits massively from the removal of the trees – a bit of extra view, maybe, but only of the park, not of the water. Still, I nervously ring the bell of the house directly behind where the trees stood.</p> <p>A woman comes to the door, buzzes open the gate. Her name is Cassandra. She’s been here a year. She says she knows nothing about the demise of the sycamores, but that the falling seeds were a nuisance, and had cut her daughter’s face. Nor is she after a bigger or better view; her living room is at the back of the house, and as I can see, she keeps the curtains closed on this side. She does say something about cultural attitudes to trees and people in different places. In Hong Kong, where she is from, they put people before trees: “Here, plants are more important than the people.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>A few weeks later and I’m getting strong deja vu. I’m back in Dorset, talking to another man named Steve who knows a lot about trees. We’re in another bit of the county, Charminster, near Dorchester, and Steve Maros, arboricultural manager of Dorset county council, is telling me about some more trees that have been killed, deliberately – murdered, you might say.</p> <p>It seems this crime wave has spread, like the poison itself, and is infecting the entire county. I went to see one of the victims on the way here – a lime tree on Court Orchard Road in Bridport. If the killing of the oaks in Poole, with their drill holes and poison injection, represents a scientific approach to the crime, then this is the opposite: crude butchery. The lime, which is 50 or 60 years old, has been hacked with a hatchet, all the way round the circumference of the trunk, “to stop the translocation of water and nutrients up and down the tree”, Maros tells me. It’s called ring-barking.</p> <p>The tree won’t survive, even if there are still some signs of life. “But we have left it up just to spite him, until it gets to the stage where it becomes dangerous. Once the timber dies it becomes brittle and is a health and safety issue.”</p> <p>It sounds as if he knows who did it. “We nearly always know who it is,” says Maros. “But unless you catch them red handed it’s impossible to prove. And neighbours don’t want to get involved.” Five years ago they used to see the odd case. “In the last couple of years there’s been a massive increase,” he says. And he shows me a list of attacks – poisonings and ring-barkings – from the past year: a birch in Coventry Close in Corfe Mullen; Churchill Close in Sturminster Marshall (although that one, another lime, survived); Woodroffe Meadow in Lyme Regis; Noake Road in Sherborne; several in Weymouth, in Alexandra Road, the Southill estate, Belle Vue Road. “Not surprisingly, many of those were to do with blocking a view of the sea,” Maros says. </p> <p>Why this sudden surge? “I think during lockdown a lot of people were sitting at home thinking, ‘We keep asking the council to get rid of that tree. They won’t do it so I’m going to take matters into my own hands.’ I think, in general, society is taking things into its own hands. We certainly get more Mr Angrys on the phone than we ever did before.” Mrs Angrys, too, he adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b05229910253261d8c655a1c1ac72bdb46d1b29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b05229910253261d8c655a1c1ac72bdb46d1b29/0_220_6605_3963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Cox examines a drill hole on one of the poisoned oaks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Cox examines a drill hole on one of the poisoned oaks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does he have any sympathy for the people whose light and views are blocked? “None whatsoever. The tree was often there long before the house. We find people will buy a house with a massive tree on the pavement outside. It’s not hidden – they must have seen it when they looked at the house. Then, within a week or two, the phone rings. ‘Oh hello, we just bought this house with a big tree outside, can you come and fell it because it’s blocking the light?’ And I say, ‘Well, no.’”</p> <p>Maros, and Dorset county council, are asking anyone with information about attacks to get in touch with the arboriculture department. They’ve had some responses, but nothing that is going to lead to prosecution, and again Dorset has never seen a successful prosecution of an attack on a council tree. Maros would like to see justice done, in the way that it has been for people cutting down trees on their property. “I think you’ve only got to make a couple of examples for the message to get across that this is actually not acceptable. At the end of the day, it’s criminal damage, like putting a brick through someone’s window. They would expect to get fined or taken to court for that. Trees are no different and they are public assets.”</p> <p>I wonder if he knows what they’ve done in a couple of places in Australia in an effort to curb the same problem? When 200 new street trees were removed or damaged in the Perth suburb of Stirling, the local authority started to put up signs in front of houses saying that a tree had been vandalised <em>outside</em> this property: publicly branding the culprits. “If someone has lopped a tree purely and simply to get a view of the city it is quite obvious it’s the owner of the property,” Stirling’s mayor Giovanni Italiano told a local radio station. “If we can’t prove who it was, the sign will go up and stay there for 12 months.”</p> <p>On the other side of the country, at Blacks Beach in Queensland, when 40 trees were illegally axed in order to open up a view to the ocean, Mackay regional council erected huge billboards in their place. You take away the trees to get a better view, we take away that view. There’s something delightfully direct about both approaches – shame ’em and block ’em. Maros, who hadn’t heard about it, seems to approve of the Aussie tactics. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/10/is-this-the-end-of-forests-as-weve-known-them\">Is this the end of forests as we’ve known them?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the way home I stop off once more at Whitecliff Park in Poole, scene of the poisoned oaks. Of all the tree attacks I’ve seen and heard about, these are the most upsetting – because of their scale, and age, and because they were part of an ancient row that is now so rudely interrupted. They’re still standing – no one’s getting a tree-free view yet. But with the other oaks in the row now in full leaf, their demise is even more stark – a pair of black ghost ships in an armada in full sail.</p> <p>As I approach, I can see the ivy has started to take over, creeping up and around, covering the drill holes, hiding the evidence. A flock of crows – a murder of crows, fittingly – has taken up residence in one of the two and is adding to the macabre mood by cawing menacingly.</p> <p>Hang on, though: the other, the bigger of the two trees, has a fuzz of pale green about one of its lower branches. Not ivy, but actual growth. Oak leaves. It doesn’t look healthy at all – the leaves are blotchy, wrinkled, sickly. And it is only one branch. I’m sure the fate of the tree is sealed and this is a last gasp rather than a new breath. But this one old oak isn’t quite dead yet.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/30/mithail-afrige-chowdhurys-best-phone-picture-ship-breakers-dhaka","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T09:00:21Z","webTitle":"‘These ship-breakers work on a site laden with toxic waste’: Mithail Afrige Chowdhury’s best phone picture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/30/mithail-afrige-chowdhurys-best-phone-picture-ship-breakers-dhaka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/30/mithail-afrige-chowdhurys-best-phone-picture-ship-breakers-dhaka","fields":{"headline":"‘These ship-breakers work on a site laden with toxic waste’: Mithail Afrige Chowdhury’s best phone picture","trailText":"The Bangladeshi photographer on workers in Dhaka who risk their lives dismantling old vessels for recycling or disposal<br>","byline":"Grace Holliday","body":"<p>Bangladeshi photographer Mithail Afrige Chowdhury has spent six years on a series featuring workers in his country’s ship-breaking yards.

It was cheaper for Freya to pay for Mabel’s medical bills out of her own pocket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0a3abfa9a72db5f9eeae11c7f37db872eb4f5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0a3abfa9a72db5f9eeae11c7f37db872eb4f5f/0_126_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Freya Liberty and Mabel the dog for Money feature\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freya Liberty’s insurer told her it no longer covered American akitas such as her rescue dog Mabel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Freya Liberty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Freya couldn’t have anticipated the cost of living crisis coinciding with Mabel being put to sleep. “We wouldn’t have done the fundraiser had it not been for the energy bill increase in April,” she says.</p> <p>Costs included a £250 cremation plus a £190 vet bill, and a couple of smaller charges for mementoes such as paw prints.</p> <p>Freya put as much as she could on to a credit card but was £100 short. She decided to set up a JustGiving page to see if family and friends would contribute.</p> <p>“Just before I set up the page, I felt as if I’d personally failed my amazing dog, who’d kept me going throughout the pandemic. She was my absolute comfort. It felt awful that I was sitting there considering whether we could get her cremated,” she says.</p> <p>The page ended up raising six times the intended amount. The £100 that Freya used from the fundraiser enabled her to bring Mabel’s ashes home. It has provided time for Freya to grieve for her pet properly before she scatters her ashes on the Welsh coast – a spot that Mabel particularly enjoyed. The other £500 went to Manchester and Cheshire Dogs Home.</p> <p>My hamster Maisie came into my life as an affordable pet. I bought her from a local pet shop in Hackney, east London, for £12.</p> <p>The cost of her upkeep was never a worry. Yet, as she took her final breath at the end of last year, I was hit with the potential cost of disposing of her body. I lived in a one-bedroom rented flat in London with no garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b4012138a992ac9ae9361c2e7ac186f2ab6131b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b4012138a992ac9ae9361c2e7ac186f2ab6131b/0_126_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Raycraft’s hamster Maisie for Money feature\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly Raycraft bought her hamster Maisie from a local pet shop in Hackney for £12.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Molly Raycraft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A ring-round of local vets indicated it would cost £125 upwards to cremate an animal weighing under 1kg such as Maisie. A burial in one of London’s dedicated pet cemeteries was another option but worked out at £320 upwards. Taxidermy – not an option I wanted to consider – was no cheaper, totalling £175 upwards.</p> <p>Burying a dead pet in a public park or forest was a common conclusion among the many people on internet forums facing the same dilemma. However, this is illegal and carries the risk of a £5,000 fine.</p> <p>A more harrowing option was to simply bin the body, costing nothing, but creating the cruel imagery of foxes mauling at the corpse of a beloved family member.</p> <p>A low-cost and time-sensitive decision had to be made. Maisie was placed in an iPhone box alongside her favourite swatch of old dressing gown. I said my goodbyes and put her coffin, wrapped in Sainsbury’s carrier bags, into my foodless freezer-turned-morgue. It gave me time to make cheaper arrangements.</p> <p>Eventually, Maisie was transported to my mother’s house, where she was laid to rest in a picturesque Kentish garden with a body count of about 30 rodents.</p> <p>My freezer and delayed burial approach is a less practical option for people with bigger pets, forcing their hand to pay cremation fees.</p> <p>Mabel’s story is one of the rare fundraisers to have a positive outcome.</p> <p>Many donation pages for pet cremation have no contributions. Owners can’t collect the ashes, leaving them with a painful sense of failing their pet in the fallout of the current crisis.</p> <p>“We have seen an increase in this area recently,” says Diane James, the head of the pet bereavement support service at Blue Cross. The pet charity has set up several pet food banks and is offering low-cost and free veterinary treatment at its animal hospitals, which includes cremation if the pet has been treated on-site.</p> <p>The vet world is also feeling the strain. “A veterinary business isn’t a particularly profitable one and comes with many stresses, hence why larger corporates are taking over practices rather than them running independently,” says Anna Foreman, the in-house vet at Everypaw Pet Insurance.</p> <p>Amid this general industry price rise, there have been cases of exploitative overcharging and negligence. Some owners report that, having paid for cremations, they ended up with pets being chucked into incinerators, and the ashes returned containing a concoction of remains.</p> <p>However, even the majority of crematoriums that are doing their best to minimise their profit margins to help bereft customers have been forced to increase their prices to stay afloat amid soaring energy bills.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Owners have been plunged into financial difficulties that could not have been predicted at the beginning of their pets’ lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“My fuel prices have doubled,” says Sue Hemmings, an undertaker at Pets At Rest on the Isle of Wight and a member of the Association of Private Pet Cemeteries and Crematoria. “Obviously, our biggest outgoing is the cost of gas because that’s how we cremate animals. All my suppliers across the board have increased their prices, from flowers and cardboard boxes to tissue, caskets and delivery charges. Not one thing has remained the same price as it was this time last year.”</p> <p>Hemmings offers payment plans, which have led to people paying as little as £5 a week out of their universal credit to pay for individual cremation. It enables them to bring their beloved pet home. Communal cremation is a cheaper option but fewer opt for this as the ashes aren’t returned.</p> <p>The reality is that many pet owners have been plunged into financial difficulties that could not have been predicted at the beginning of their pets’ lives.</p> <p>Demand for pet-friendly rental properties increased by 120% between July 2020 and July 2021, reflecting the sharp rise in pet ownership during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/articles/property-news/pet-friendly-rental-homes/\" title=\"\">according to data</a> from the property website Rightmove.</p> <p>The government has responded to this by issuing <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-standard-tenancy-agreement-to-help-renters-with-well-behaved-pets\" title=\"\">a model tenancy agreement</a>, which discourages blanket bans on pets. It is expected to be supported by more mandatory measures in the renters’ reform bill in the spring of 2023, which should mean more pets in rentals.</p> <p>However, a combination of reduced access to affordable burial and cremation options, and the rising cost of living, mean a pet’s death may, for some, spark an increase in debt and some difficult decisions.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/30/transfer-news-leicester-city-reject-newcastle-40m-bid-james-maddison","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T08:32:06Z","webTitle":"Leicester City reject Newcastle’s £40m bid for James Maddison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/transfer-news-leicester-city-reject-newcastle-40m-bid-james-maddison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/30/transfer-news-leicester-city-reject-newcastle-40m-bid-james-maddison","fields":{"headline":"Leicester City reject Newcastle’s £40m bid for James Maddison","trailText":"Leicester City have rejected a £40m bid for James Maddison from Newcastle United","byline":"Jacob Steinberg","body":"<p>Leicester City have rejected a £40m bid for James Maddison from Newcastle United.</p> <p>Eddie Howe has identified Maddison as a key target this summer and Newcastle are weighing up whether to test Leicester’s resolve by making an improved bid for the attacking midfielder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/sunday-the-king-plays-cristiano-ronaldo-reveals-manchester-united-return\">‘Sunday, the King plays’: Cristiano Ronaldo reveals Manchester United return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leicester are the only team in the Premier League who are yet to make a senior signing this summer.

The claim that a voice to parliament is mere symbolism, for example, as if symbols haven’t been powerfully motivating throughout history. Or the idea that the government should instead concentrate on practical policies, as if it can’t do both, and as if a representative voice would not also be a practical means to drive change.</p> \n<p>Others will be much harder to navigate.</p> \n<p>The prime minister is proposing three fairly simple constitutional changes, one of them stating that the parliament will legislate the detail of the voice. While he’ll legislate to set up the simple proposition for the referendum, all the details of the voice will be contained in subsequent laws thrashed out by the parliament, which by definition can’t be passed until after the referendum decides whether or not the voice is going to happen at all.</p> \n<p>For now he doesn’t want to go any further than that – deflecting demands for any more detail on whether a voice will be elected or how it will be representative.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"58bc76da-89a6-4b68-ac16-4e002405c2df\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nN5omvCUH6M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Labor knows it will have to answer some of these questions eventually. Yes, they have been addressed by the co-design process set up when the Coalition was in government, and in innumerable other committee investigations and reports in the years of debate since the Uluru Statement from the Heart. But now the electorate really needs to understand the answers.</p> \n<p>Labor also knows the greatest threat to maintaining momentum lies in getting bogged down in arguments over the detail with those whose aim is to sink the plan – effectively repeating the mistakes that enabled John Howard to defeat the republic referendum in 1998. “There may well be misinformation and fear campaigns to counter,” Albanese said, in what is almost certainly an understatement.</p> \n<p>The opposition spokesman, Julian Leeser, who attended Garma with the prime minister and his ministers in the “spirit of bipartisanship” and who worked with Senator Patrick Dodson on the constitutional recognition select committee, immediately hedged his bets, welcoming the statement and demanding the detail at the same time.</p> \n<p>And then there’s the question of amending the legislation setting up the “machinery” of conducting referenda, to align it with modern voting expectations and perhaps to modernise the somewhat outdated provision that politicians supporting the “yes” and “no” case write an essay which is mailed to all voters.</p> \n<p>It seems unlikely the government will suspend the provisions of the act to allow public funding of a “yes” and “no” case, leaving it up to each side to raise funds, but that process will almost certainly bring more controversy and debate.</p> \n<p>The momentum for the prime minister’s “unifying Australian moment” that will rise “above politics” felt powerful against the red earth of Garma, delivered to an audience some of whom had waited lifetimes to hear a prime minister say those words. Maintaining it through an ill-tempered political discourse with little capacity for nuance or attention to detail will be the prime minister’s great challenge.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/30/chris-xu-shein-mysterious-billionaire-founder-fast-fashion","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"Chris Xu: Who is Shein’s mysterious billionaire founder?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/30/chris-xu-shein-mysterious-billionaire-founder-fast-fashion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/30/chris-xu-shein-mysterious-billionaire-founder-fast-fashion","fields":{"headline":"Chris Xu: Who is Shein’s mysterious billionaire founder?","trailText":"Very little is known about China’s king of fast fashion who has rapidly become one its richest men","byline":"Helen Davidson in Taipei","body":"<p>There are only two public anecdotes about Xu Yangtian, also known as Chris Xu – the mysterious billionaire founder of Shein.

According to two former business partners and colleagues, after having successfully built an e-commerce company together, one day they turned up and he was gone. Allegedly taking the company’s PayPal accounts with him, Xu ignored their calls and “kicked [them] out of the game”.</p> <p>Alone, Xu went on the establish a company that would reach a $100bn valuation within a decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd0616d0d9cad52f77a47a917962f070660f991c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd0616d0d9cad52f77a47a917962f070660f991c/0_308_4718_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue DeTiger performs during Shein X Rock the Runway in Simi Valley, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blue DeTiger performs during Shein X Rock the Runway in Simi Valley, California. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a funding round earlier this year, Shein was valued at more than Zara’s owner Inditex and H&amp;M combined. Last week it announced a new executive hire to <a href=\"https://ww.fashionnetwork.com/news/Shein-hires-development-director-for-european-market,1426375.html\">spearhead its expansion to Europe</a>, Jacobo Garcia Miña, whose CV includes senior roles at Inditex and Britain’s luxury Burberry label. He will oversee operations from Dublin, as Shein prepares to open pop-up stores in major European cities this summer.</p> <p>Its brand recognition, particularly among young shoppers, is already enormous. Even if you have never visited its site or app, your browsers and social media platforms have more than likely fed you its ads.</p> <p>Xu is among China’s richest men, but is far less well known than figures like Alibaba’s Jack Ma, or Tencent’s Pony Ma. He refuses interviews and rarely comments publicly outside the occasional press release quote.</p> <p>Differing reports describe him as a Chinese-American who studied at George Washington University, or as born in Shandong in 1984, going on to study at Qingdao University of Science and Technology. Shein has told media that Xu is Chinese-born. Chinese media describes him as being an average student from a poor background, who had to work to support himself through college. He developed a skill with search engine optimisation (SEO) which would underpin his future success.</p> <p>Reports on Xu’s background and rise through the industry have painted a picture of a hardworking SEO whiz, with an alleged capacity for ruthless business decisions. In 2008 he formed a cross-border e-commerce business, Nanjing Dianwei Information Technology, with two partners: Wang Xiaohu had an equal share and Li Peng was a consultant with a 10% stake.</p> <p>Li told Wired in May the trio rented a small office, trying to sell anything from teapots to phones, before moving towards clothing. They began honing the model for what would later become Shein – tiny direct-to-customer orders placed with small suppliers, turned around quickly in response to demand rather than predicted sales, and using Xu’s SEO skills for trend spotting and promotion. “We were going for low margins and large quantities,” Li told the outlet.</p> <p>In 2011 Xu created SheInside, a Nanjing-based online wedding dress retailer and Shein’s predecessor. Multiple reports have detailed controversy around this move, with Li claiming Xu “kicked me and [Wang] out of the game”. According to Li, Xu disappeared from the office one day with control of the company’s PayPal accounts, ignoring all calls. Li directed the Guardian towards previous interviews where he had already made the claim, but also declined to elaborate further. Wang told the Guardian Li’s version was correct, but declined to comment further.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09d9827925b2d697d5dba2df90ff7976306fb76b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09d9827925b2d697d5dba2df90ff7976306fb76b/0_3_900_1125/800.jpg\" alt=\"A satin dress by Shein.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satin dress by Shein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shein</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shein has rejected this characterisation of events in previous reports, and Xu reportedly threatened to sue when the claims were first published. A spokesperson told the Guardian that Li only worked for Nanjing Dianwei from October 2008 to mid-2009, but confirmed neither Wang or Li became partners of SheInside nor had any business ties with SheInside. Xu could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>Two years after starting SheInside, in one of his only known public social media posts, Xu wrote on Facebook: “The company has grown rapidly and has more than 50 employees!” In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/she-in-shine-out-sheinside-changes-brand-name-to-shein-300095504.html\">the company became </a>Shein, moving its headquarters to Guangzhou, and opening an office in the US.</p> <p>Under Xu, Shein began to develop its own supply chain, what the tech analyst and founder of Tech Buzz China Rui Ma terms the “dirty work” that other less successful competitors neglected. It hired technical college graduates to scour the internet for popular designs. It also formed an inhouse design team, and bought competitor Romwe – an e-commerce company founded by Li and his then girlfriend. Shein’s ads and products became ubiquitous, flooding the internet and becoming a major user of advertising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/aug/29/fast-fashion-retailer-shein-design-reality-show\">driven by influencers, celebrities and social media</a> – especially TikTok.</p> <p>The company earned a rare reputation among its thousands of suppliers – primarily in the Nancun neighbourhood of Guangzhou – for paying accounts on time, but also for stringent requirements that reportedly led to high attrition rates. Ma says the consistent monthly pay cycle is a contributing reason for why suppliers try to stick with Shein, despite tough commercial conditions.</p> <p>“Basically, suppliers are either making no money, or often times, losing money on the initial order,” says Ma in a recent analysis. “They’re mostly hoping to make a viral item that can result in a large volume order for that item.”</p> <p>Shein’s spokesperson said it was innovative practices that allowed it to cut costs and pass savings on to customers. “Our technology-driven, nimble supply chain model is able to reduce overproduction by utilising actual market demands to predict sales and control production,” they said.</p> <p>The company has also been dogged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/06/they-took-my-world-fashion-giant-shein-accused-of-art-theft\">accusations and instances of plagiarism</a>.</p> <p>Industry insiders tell the Guardian there is widespread scepticism of Shein’s sustainability as a business model. That scepticism has only increased during the pandemic, as supply chain woes have slowed down or crushed the rest of the industry, but Shein has continued to grow, largely unaffected.</p> <p>In recent years the focus has returned again to Xu, amid rumours and reports of expansions and international asset transfers demonstrating the CEO’s ambition that Shein grow even larger. Reports in May said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/27/retailer-missguided-on-brink-of-calling-in-administrators\">Shein was angling to buy UK clothing giant Missguided</a> before its recent collapse, after a failed attempt to buy Topshop in 2021.

There are now numerous links between Shein and Singapore, with key assets including the headquarters of the legal operators of Shein’s website – Roadget Business, now shifted from China to the city-state. The shift could be helpful in bypassing China’s strict and often unpredictable regulation of offshore IPOs.</p> <p>Chinese business records show Xu has been cutting some business ties with his homeland. He began dropping management and legal roles with Shein and related entities, including Guangzhou Xiyin International Import &amp; Export, in late 2020, and his second in command, Molly Miao, took over as legal representative of Shein in China. Miao could not be reached for comment. Records show the main Chinese entity – Nanjing Lingtian Information Technology – was deregistered in 2021.</p> <p>Shein did not respond to questions about changes to the business ownership and asset locations, or the plans in Singapore or New York.</p> <p>While the business has continued to grow, some the shine has come off Shein’s performance. Sales grew 60% in 2021 to $16bn, Bloomberg reported, down from a 250% jump to $10bn the year before, and recent private sales of its shares are said to be at discounts from its April valuation of $100bn. Investors will be asking if Xu can maintain the momentum.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu and Chi Hui Lin</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/jul/30/frederick-douglass-musical-american-prophet","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"Frederick Douglass gets the Hamilton treatment with new musical","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/30/frederick-douglass-musical-american-prophet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jul/30/frederick-douglass-musical-american-prophet","fields":{"headline":"Frederick Douglass gets the Hamilton treatment with new musical","trailText":"American Prophet, focusing on the abolitionist, orator and polymath, is the latest marker of a Douglass renaissance in popular culture","byline":"David Smith in Washington","body":"<p>For <a href=\"https://fdfi.org/kennethbmorrisjr/\">Kenneth Morris</a>, sitting in a darkened theatre among hundreds of people, it was a moment of a communion with a man he never met but whose light he carries wherever he goes.</p> <p>Morris is the great-great-great-grandson of Frederick Douglass, abolitionist, orator and polymath.

The story of how he escaped slavery as a young man to become a leading thinker, speaker and star – the most photographed man of the 19th century – was told in a Pulitzer prize-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/david-blight-on-frederick-douglass-i-call-him-beautifully-human\">biography by David Blight</a> in 2018 and his speeches featured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/26/frederick-douglass-hbo-documentary?ref=upstract.com&amp;curator=upstract.com&amp;utm_source=upstract.com\">an HBO documentary film</a> earlier this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01c0c3848755948b9322b1a8dac2e2b625a08484\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01c0c3848755948b9322b1a8dac2e2b625a08484/0_83_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cornelius Smith Jr as Frederick Douglass in American Prophet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cornelius Smith Jr as Frederick Douglass in American Prophet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arena Stage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It suggests that former US president Donald Trump got his tenses confused but was not entirely wrong when he observed: “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.”</p> <p>Now Douglass has got the Hamilton treatment – sort of. Development of American Prophet <a href=\"https://www.americanprophetthemusical.com/\">began in 2015</a>, the same year that Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hip-hop influenced musical about the founding fathers made its debut and became a sensation.</p> <p>Like Hamilton, the show features a president (in this case Abraham Lincoln) bursting into song, a score (by Marcus Hummon) that crosses style barriers and a meditation on legacy and “who tells your story” (Anna, noting that her husband’s name will be remembered by history, asks: “But will mine? Will mine?”)</p> <p>But whereas Hamilton has received criticism in recent years for underplaying slavery in the national origins story, American Prophet puts the issue front and centre. There are flashbacks to Douglass’s early life in bondage when Anna (Kristolyn Lloyd), a conductor on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/17/their-stories-need-to-be-told-the-true-story-behind-the-underground-railroad\">the underground railroad</a>, encourages him to flee. “My children will not have a slave for a father,” she tells him. “You are not a slave.”</p> <p>At one point Douglass (<a href=\"https://corneliussmithjr.com/\">Cornelius Smith Jr</a>) recites his celebrated speech: “What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"464f910b3418acf7a74d43f9c89e63b5e0016c25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/464f910b3418acf7a74d43f9c89e63b5e0016c25/0_203_1200_1500/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kristolyn Lloyd as Anna Murray Douglass in American Prophet.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristolyn Lloyd as Anna Murray Douglass in American Prophet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arena Stage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And a Douglass call to action is turned into a rousing musical number: “It is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.” At the climax of the show, he addresses the audience directly and asks them to consider what their contribution to justice will be. “Agitate. Agitate. Agitate!” he urges.</p> <p>For Morris, who is president of <a href=\"https://fdfi.org/\">Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives</a>, a non-profit organisation that works to combat human trafficking and racism, and who worked as a consultant on the production, such a cry is more pertinent then ever in the Washington of 2022.</p> <p>He said: “His words still 170 years later resonate, unfortunately. There’s still a lot of work to be done. But we need his voice and we need to be inspired by the great freedom fighters that came before us because we’re living at a time when the country is as divided as it’s been in a long time with the racist, sexist, xenophobic rhetoric that is out there.</p> <p>“In the 19th century they ‘othered’ people of African descent to justify taking away their humanity and treating them inhumanely. They would say things like, ‘They’re better off in slavery. Listen to the happy songs that they’re singing. They’re getting the Christian religion.’</p> <p>“When we think about making a group of people an ‘other’, I think about things like ‘They’re coming to invade our country, they’re rapists or criminals’, justifying mistreating a group of people so that their children can be put in cages. History is not just about the past, but it’s also about the present and it’s about the future as well.”</p> <p>The sentiments were echoed by <a href=\"https://randolph-wright.com/\">Charles Randolph-Wright</a>, the show’s director and co-scriptwriter. After Thursday night’s performance, Randolph-Wright took the stage and said: “It’s so important that we figure out a way to communicate and that’s what we hope for with this piece, that you all, every single one of you, goes out and agitates because that’s what we must do. We have no choice. We do need the fire as Frederick told us 170 years ago<em>.”</em></p> <p>He added: “At a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/republicans-critical-race-theory-winning-electoral-issue\">critical race theory</a>, Frederick Douglass and Anna Murray Douglass will not be taught in schools, we have to find the way that it is taught, that they learn about these extraordinary people. And there are so many that did this, so many women who’ve always been ignored in the movement. It’s imperative that we now see and hear them<em>.”</em></p> <p>Douglass was born in 1818, escaped from slavery in 1838 and became a prominent abolitionist, conveying to audiences the horror of his first-hand experience and touring Britain and Ireland.</p> <p>American Prophet is set between 1851 and 1865 with flashbacks to his past. It charts Douglass’s complicated interactions with the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2009/dec/02/john-brown-civil-war\">extremist John Brown</a> and President Lincoln, whose assassination on Thursday night prompted one audience member to exclaim, “Oh, shit!”</p> <p>In a Zoom interview this week, Randolph-Wright, 65, reflected: “Hamilton just blew open the door of what we could do, especially for younger audiences to want to discover history. I hope that we can do that same thing with this storytelling and I hope people are hungry for it. We need to understand where we’ve been to deal with where we are and where we’re going.<em>”</em></p> <p>The musical was originally supposed to be staged in the summer of 2020 but was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. Randolph-Wright added: “My view of this show is radically different now in 2022 than it was in 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9eb453d726c0e23dfc19f43f024b7f6066354fd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eb453d726c0e23dfc19f43f024b7f6066354fd7/0_120_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cornelius Smith Jr as Frederick Douglass and the cast of American Prophet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cornelius Smith Jr as Frederick Douglass and the cast of American Prophet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arena Stage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Being in Washington when all of the things are happening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/12/january-6-hearing-trump-analysis\">with January 6</a>, with the supreme court – we’re rehearsing and trying to go in and do this work and all this around us is insanity. That’s what was around Frederick and he dealt with it and tried to figure out what was the answer. The answer changes.”</p> <p>Randolph-Wright, who comes from a long line of civil rights activists, found Douglass’s words both beautiful and prescient. “They are what he wrote about 170 years ago and this we are still dealing with, especially what people of colour deal with every single day in this country, what women deal with, all of it.</p> <p>“Those words still resonate so strongly. I’ve had friends who’ve come to this show already and they say, ‘You wrote those, right?’ I’m like, ‘No, no, that’s his speech word for word.’”</p> <p>The words also struck a chord with the opening night audience at Arena Stage. Jamie Stiehm, 61, a columnist and historian <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/parallel-lives-from-the-eastern-shore/\">who has studied Douglass</a>, said the musical format worked: “It was so passionate, it was so serious, it wasn’t light and whimsical. It didn’t trivialise anything. It ended on that note of ‘we need the fire’ and to ‘agitate’. I thought the actors brought that to life and he himself would have been pleased with the production.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/30/spoilt-unruly-children-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"Spoilt and unruly children playing dress-up: how the Tories stopped being serious | Alan Finlayson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/30/spoilt-unruly-children-tories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/30/spoilt-unruly-children-tories","fields":{"headline":"Spoilt and unruly children playing dress-up: how the Tories stopped being serious","trailText":"Rebelliousness against any rule they don’t like has replaced political philosophy, says Alan Finlayson, professor of political and social theory","byline":"Alan Finlayson","body":"<p>What has happened to English Conservatism? The party was once believed to have a sophisticated grasp of statecraft and a “natural” capacity to hold on to power. Here it is now, spending the summer trapped in a nightmare of its own making. The cakeist unseriousness of the celebrity Boris Johnson has been spun off into a TV game show: charmless candidates for the next prime minister pander to judges who form not so much a party as a youth subculture that has grown geriatric – its codes and styles opaque to anyone who doesn’t collect Thatcherite “merch” from the 1980s.</p> <p>All this – like Johnson’s reign of backfire – is symptomatic of a longer, wider and deeper ideological decline. Conservative political philosophy used to make arguments that opponents had to reckon with: sharp and informed<strong> </strong>scepticism about the grand plans of those who know the world through books alone and the expectation that technocrats in Whitehall could manage benevolently and wisely all of the time. Emphasising the tragic flaws in human nature, warning that efforts to perfect ourselves can give free rein to our imperfections, it was an important counterbalance to political arrogance. Such big ideas challenged the rationalists and progressives of the liberal centre and socialist left.</p> <p>But the Conservatives of today are possessed of a small idea: that they should be able to do whatever they want, whenever they want (to whoever they want), and that the rest of us should not just accept this but facilitate and celebrate them – or be condemned as “snowflakes”.</p> <p>In recent years, casual asides have shown up this intellectual decline. Andrew Murrison MP, complaining about the National Trust’s research into the history of the slave trade, said he wanted only to see “an <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2020-11-11d.437.0\">elegant pile of bricks</a> or a beautiful landscape before going for a nice cup of tea and a slice of cake” – as if Britain’s land were but a play park and its history mere homework.</p> <p>The initial response of the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, to the invasion of Ukraine was not ministerial gravitas but schoolboy enthusiasm; his old regiment had “<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/well-kick-putins-backside-says-ben-wallace-0htn8hdps\">kicked the backside</a>” of the tsar in the Crimean war and could “always do it again”. Alongside such idlers and fantasists, the party is full of student politics sectarians self-identifying as culture warriors and acting like excitable teenagers. They warn of conspiratorial elites they read about online, using imported American slang such as “deep state”, a penchant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/18/boris-johnson-defends-record-as-government-faces-confidence-vote\">Johnson indulged</a> in his speech on the no-confidence motion his government called on itself.</p> <p>Now the party, advised by spads who can’t hold a drink – if the wine stains on the walls of Downing Street are anything to go by – has chosen two ideal avatars of its own self-images, and set them to fight over who started it. On one side is a man thought to be the richest in the House, a public schoolboy who never had any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2022/jul/11/rishi-sunak-criticised-footage-no-working-class-friends-video\">working-class friends</a> and for whom politics is a hobby; on the other, a politician unrestrained by commitments to anything other than her own advancement, and whose success lies in realising that she can tickle the Tory tummy by talking about British cheeses and Yorkshire tea while looking as if she’s imagining the execution of her speechwriter.</p> <p>What accounts for this extraordinary infantilisation of English Conservatism?</p> <p>The core of Conservative ideology has always been a principled commitment to inequality. It exists to defend aristocracy – not the rule of the posh but the rule of the best. Part of its success lies in how it can always change the definition of “the best”: from ancient landowners to new entrepreneurs creating wealth and nobly allowing it to trickle down; from great Britons to plucky Englishmen throwing off the shackles of backwards Brussels and rebellious Scots.</p> <p>According to conservative political philosophy, nature has made only a few fit to rule, enabling them to see further, deeper and higher than ordinary people. Accordingly, they cannot be confined by conventions and regulations. They have an aristocratic licence to break the rules because they serve a higher value: defence of the realm; market innovation; the mystical will of the people. Crucially, this idea has mutated into the belief that, because the best aren’t bound by the rules, if you break the rules you must be one of the best. Refusing to be bound by the decisions of judges, being ostentatiously uncivil online, ignoring the international treaty you just signed, is reimagined as proof of fitness for office.</p> <p>Long embedded in a culture that celebrates daringly naughty aristocrats, this kind of thinking has been particularly animated by the concept of the “<a href=\"https://wordhistories.net/2020/10/03/nanny-state/\">nanny state</a>”. The term originated, naturally, in a column in the Spectator<em> </em>in 1965. A metaphorical trump card, it has been played endlessly to block any and every proposition about what it might be in our common interest to regulate. It makes selfish obstinacy feel like a bold assertion of maturity, independence and self-reliance. The myth of the nanny state gives believers a teenage thrill of anti-authoritarianism. But because the high is fleeting, they must always search again for a nanny against whom they can prove themselves: trade unionists, judges and human rights lawyers; virologists, statisticians, people wearing face masks; the BBC, the SNP, the ECHR. In extreme cases they assert themselves against the nannying laws of physics, which insist on governing the interactions of CO2 molecules with solar radiation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/15/britain-ni-protocol-brexit-ministers-deal\">Britain’s attack on its own protocol is one more exercise in Brexit gaslighting | Fintan O’Toole</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once it has succumbed to this childlike conception of political freedom, other parts of conservatism also retreat to the nursery. For instance, the British right has always appreciated the aesthetic dimensions of political life, or, rather, the theatre of power. Margaret Thatcher was a skilled player, artful political instinct informing her performances of Boudicca, Britannia and the Iron Lady. Her political grandchildren know only how to cloak themselves in secondhand stereotypes. Johnson’s cultivated dishevelment evokes a naughty but clever schoolboy: Just William Goes to Parliament. Jacob Rees-Mogg has long since lost himself in method-acting the part of an indifferent aristocrat. And so the leadership candidates argue over their cosplay: Liz Truss’s low-rent Thatcher tribute act wrapped up in a bow versus Rishi Sunak’s suits and Prada shoes.</p> <p>For Conservatives today, politics is a role-playing game in which the winners get to do whatever they want. They offer neither the maintenance of tradition nor a well-managed economy but, having broken the social contract, promise their nervous supporters that they too can be one of the best, jumping the queue and speaking their mind without consequence. Confined by our unfit, decaying and inequitable constitution, the rest of us can only look on at this unruly children’s party, knowing full well who is paying for the breakages.<br></p> <p>But playtime cannot last for ever. Reality – a broken ambulance service, inflation outstripping wages, the climate crisis – never goes away. It’s up to us to<strong> </strong>take back control from these political juveniles, and school them properly.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alan Finlayson is professor of political and social theory at the University of East Anglia</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jul/30/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-garma-festival-covid-cases-deaths-hospitals-surge","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T07:46:14Z","webTitle":"Coalition offers qualified support for Indigenous voice as PM reveals referendum wording – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/30/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-garma-festival-covid-cases-deaths-hospitals-surge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/30/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-garma-festival-covid-cases-deaths-hospitals-surge","fields":{"headline":"Coalition offers qualified support for Indigenous voice as PM reveals referendum wording – as it happened","trailText":"Anthony Albanese announces draft wording of referendum question in Garma festival speech.

My parents were disabled, I lived on a council estate. But in the 00s I saw a lot of people out of work and nothing happening to them. Benefits were at a level where there was a slight disincentive to work. My mum was on disability allowance and there was no meaningful effort to get her back into the workplace – she was really smart and that was a shame. I felt New Labour had got a bit exhausted.</p> <p><strong>Rufus</strong> When Jeremy Corbyn’s policies were put to people blind, they received between 60 and 90% approval on the doorstep. Right now I am not even on the political spectrum: I’m, like, tear-it-all-down anti-capitalist. I think capitalism and patriarchy between them have ruined everything that’s good about being alive, and I only understand that now I am a bit older.</p> <p><strong>Geoff</strong> My politics have a pessimistic view of some things, but I do think well of people. I don’t have that thing the left has for the right, you know: “How would you feel if your kid married a Tory?” Labour voters would be significantly less happy than a Tory voter would be if their kid married a Labour voter.</p> <p><strong>Rufus</strong> It’s like asking an alligator: would you be happy if your kid married a chick. The alligators all go: “Yeah, we’re actually quite in favour of that.” If my son, who I’m raising to be compassionate and empathic, reached his teenage years and went, “Dad, I’ve joined the Tories,” I’d find it very hard to look him in the eye. I would still love him though, just for the record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e16f24a425da6fad58bd5d1b376bffb338485ca4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e16f24a425da6fad58bd5d1b376bffb338485ca4/0_134_7779_4669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedians Geoff Norcott and Rufus Hound chatting at a table at Hide restaurant in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The big beef</strong></p> <p><strong>Geoff</strong> I wouldn’t describe myself as anti-woke, but I have seen subjects dismissed – not the take on the subject, the whole subject. I guess people wonder if the juice is worth the squeeze, and that is something I’m seeing more of.</p> <p><strong>Rufus</strong> I would be won over by the idea that this new censorious culture is ruining comedy were it not for the fact that there has been no shortage of comedy in the last few years that I have found absolutely hilarious.</p> <p><strong>Geoff</strong> I do have a bit in my current show about trans stuff. I tried a bit on the last tour and it’s taking a while to get it right; people didn’t laugh. I trust audiences, and if they recoil then I think there’s something wrong with it. Now what I talk about is the difference in tone with people transitioning from female to male – it doesn’t seem that many men give any shits about that, and I think that’s funny and interesting, so I mine that. I think it comes down to the quality threshold of the joke, so rather than be wary of a subject, be wary of having a bad joke on a subject. Touring since the pandemic, I don’t know if audiences want offence. I definitely don’t think they’re specifically saying: “I want rightwing comedy.” What they do like is honesty; if you take a slight risk in terms of being honest, and if it’s funny, that’s what is getting rewards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Rufus</strong> I feel differently about all of it. The idea that there is anything you can’t say is nonsense. What you can’t do is say anything you like and expect that people who are upset or offended by what you’ve said can’t voice the fact they are upset or offended. There are consequences. I grew up heroising Bill Hicks, but then marginalised voices started saying some of that stuff is really bad. When we hear these voices our choice is how we respond to them, and it seems to me, as a humanist with a bit of decency and compassion, what does it hurt to make those changes?</p> <p><strong>Geoff</strong> Standup has that unique licence: what makes it an incredible art form is that you can just be really honest, and if you put your little joke token in, you might get to say something that people in normal society might not quite be able to get away with saying. Not something offensive, just something a bit more real.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20164f542abf8112be475e3694271660cf805a3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20164f542abf8112be475e3694271660cf805a3f/0_258_6454_3873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedians Geoff Norcott and Rufus Hound chatting at a table at Hide restaurant in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Sharing plate</strong></p> <p><strong>Rufus</strong> I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and I’m basically a mess as a result.

The sense Bernard Manning created for his audience was: people who aren’t the same colour as you are second-class citizens. That’s why we censor his jokes – that makes sense to me. However, if the comedian on stage caveats it for a full 20 seconds, then immediately afterwards goes, “Yeah I know, horrific isn’t it?” I don’t understand how under those conditions hate is being spread.</p> <p><strong>Geoff</strong> They stripped it of context. I suppose that is our version of pleading the fifth.</p> <p><strong>Rufus</strong> Also tone. How something is said by a comedian in the last 20 minutes of their set on a Saturday night sounds very different from you reading it over your cornflakes on Monday morning with the Daily Mail.</p> <p><strong>Geoff</strong> I rate being a comedian above all other loyalties. It’s kind of extreme sports – when you meet other people who have done that, it’s like a union, before politics, leftwing or rightwing, anything like that. We’ve got much more in common by being comedians than anything else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7543830d1440201fe8ca4eb8f3afcdb6f78a92b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7543830d1440201fe8ca4eb8f3afcdb6f78a92b/0_153_7645_4587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedians Geoff Norcott and Rufus Hound chatting at a table at Hide restaurant in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p> <p><strong>Geoff</strong> I was a bit apprehensive because I know how passionate you are about your politics.

Sitting the kids in front of the TV for hours on end obviously shouldn’t be the only solution, but it needn’t be as passive as all that. A family film marathon can be a cheerfully sociable use of shared time – not to mention a cheap one, for parents burnt out on repeat cinema trips to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/02/minions-the-rise-of-gru-review-another-serving-of-funny-goofball-nonsense-steve-carell\">Minions: The Rise of Gru</a></em>. But which streaming platforms will serve you best this summer? And how few of them can you get away with subscribing to? Allow me to break down the best they have to offer.</p> <h2><strong>Disney+</strong></h2> <p>The top option seems like a no-brainer: over the past century, Disney has evolved from a film studio into the key corporate influencer of childhood (and beyond, it seems, as adults’ thirst for Disney-branded superhero entertainment shows no sign of abating). A perverse part of me wants to tell you that Disney+ isn’t worth throwing monthly subscription fees into the coffers of a company that hardly needs the spare change. The more practical part sees how invaluable it is for parents of small children.</p> <p>The highlights are obvious, beginning with the platform’s near-complete library of animated features from the Disney and Pixar stables. Perhaps the kids will insist on watching <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/frozen/4uKGzAJi3ROz\">Frozen</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/moana/70GoJHflgHH9\">Moana</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/toy-story/1Ye1nzUgtF7d\">Toy Story</a></strong> for the 17th time; perhaps you can wield your parental nostalgia rights and try out a classic that’s new to them. My own childhood loyalties compel me to plump for <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/the-little-mermaid/5MpPFhS8FTXh\">The Little Mermaid</a></strong>, though equally I’ve never seen a kid uncharmed by <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/the-jungle-book/5trzAb4Rz3F9\">The Jungle Book</a></strong>. If you dare try <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/bambi/2s64jMJasyNO\">Bambi</a></strong>, be mindful of the fact that it’s exactly as laceratingly sad as you remember.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3b7c308b515489480e7e2eac558291fb07012a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3b7c308b515489480e7e2eac558291fb07012a2/0_342_2944_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bambi, 1942.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bambi, 1942. Disney/Allstar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Should you be ready to move on to live action, large-scale musicals do the job just as well as when they were the four-quadrant blockbusters of the 1950s and 1960s. Disney+ has the essential pair of Julie Andrews vehicles. <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/mary-poppins/3P3waOoBmUdm\">Mary Poppins</a></strong>, with its animated interludes, dash of teaching-moment suffragette politics and effectively bittersweet conclusion, is an ideal transitional film for young viewers, while <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/the-sound-of-music/4c1Sp2qE83Fc\">The Sound of Music</a></strong> presents parents with a few more real-world complications to explain, but enough indelible songs and curtain-clad japery to make it all palatable.</p> <p>Otherwise, the eternally endearing Muppets bridge the gap between juvenile whimsy and more grownup wit: Disney+ has 2011’s fresh, bouncy reboot <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/the-muppets/pBEV9Y7KrRg7\">The Muppets</a></strong>, but also 1979’s original <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/the-muppet-movie/2rJuGncIuWy1\">The Muppet Movie</a></strong>, which plays just as spryly, and with more enduring songs. As for slightly older children willing to shed fantasy entirely, Robin Williams’s nearly 30-year-old smash <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/mrs-doubtfire/RpQjgk9ZcSih\">Mrs</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/mrs-doubtfire/RpQjgk9ZcSih\"> Doubtfire</a></strong> remains antically funny and just rude enough, even if its gender politics haven’t aged quite as well as the star’s bravura performance. For quieter, thoughtful children, meanwhile, Mira Nair’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/movies/queen-of-katwe/6FtfjP77HPmS\">Queen of Katwe</a></strong> is among the Mouse House’s more underrated recent offerings. A stirring, kind-hearted true story of a Ugandan girl rising from poverty to international chess competitions, it’s like a sunnily wholesome <em>Queen’s Gambit</em>.</p> <h2><strong>BBC iPlayer</strong></h2> <p>For anyone unwilling to pay for Disney titles, the free BBC iPlayer has a couple of treats still on offer: Tom Holland’s first (and best) two outings as Spider-Man – <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0012k3b/spiderman-far-from-home\">Far </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0012k3b/spiderman-far-from-home\">from Home</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000qq38/spiderman-homecoming\">Homecoming</a></strong> – are on the platform’s current film menu for the next two weeks, as is <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b007cjnd/monsters-inc\">Monsters, Inc</a></strong> – still, for my money, one of the warmest and peppiest capers in the Pixar canon. Prefer to hit up the Beeb for more homegrown kids’ fare? You’re in luck: also on offer currently is Aardman Animations’ droll prehistoric comedy <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000qq5b/early-man\">Early Man</a></strong> – no classic, but even Aardman’s boilerplate films have more character than most – and the original, still heart-lifting adaptation of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b018jv82/the-railway-children\">The Railway Children</a></strong>, particularly well timed if you’ve been on a family outing to see the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/17/the-railway-children-return-review-amiable-but-predictable-sequel\">likable sequel</a> in cinemas.</p> <h2><strong>Netflix</strong></h2> <p>You can head to Netflix for the most deservedly beloved British family films of recent times. <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70305929\">Paddington</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80195897\">Paddington 2</a></strong>, with their tender, visually inventive and occasionally riotous reinvention of Michael Bond’s bear-out-of-water tales, might just be the cream of the streamer’s children’s movies – though there’s a good deal to choose from, especially via their dedicated Netflix Kids platform. Netflix’s in-house animation has been particularly impressive of late. Last year’s zany <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81399614\">The Mitchells vs the Machines</a></strong>, in which a dysfunctional family fights a robot apocalypse, was a clever, hyperactive delight; this year’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81018682\">The Sea Beast</a></strong>, a rip-roaring, monster-hunting adventure on the high seas, sees them emulating classic Disney with splendid results. (No surprise there: director Chris Williams also gave us <em>Moana</em>.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2efa32c8c15494a860b15d637a151d8ab61a258e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2efa32c8c15494a860b15d637a151d8ab61a258e/0_0_1920_1038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sea Beast.

For toddlers, the mellow, none-more-gentle <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/60032294\">My Neighbo</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/60032294\">r Totoro</a></strong> is a safe bet, but older, more fanciful kids can thrill to the knottier, more perilous quest narratives of <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/60023642\">Spirited Away</a></strong> and the like.</p> <p>Shifting back to American fare, there’s the robust, airborne adventure <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70109893\">How to Train Your Dragon</a></strong>, and a number of worthwhile live-action titles, including the Bowie-starring neogoth fairytale <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/680020\">Labyrinth</a></strong>, by now the source of multiple generations of childhood nightmares; Danny DeVito’s enduringly popular Americanisation of Roald Dahl’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70033005\">Matilda</a></strong>; and the sensitive, rather sweet disability parable <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80147986#:~:text=2017%20%7C%20PG%20%7C%201h%2053m%20%7C,Watch%20all%20you%20want.\">Wonder</a></strong>. Families with kids edging into teendom, meanwhile, can hardly do better than Greta Gerwig’s smashing, stout-hearted rejig of <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81140933\">Little Women</a></strong>.</p> <h2><strong>Apple TV+</strong></h2> <p>Netflix’s subscription-based rivals lag somewhat behind in their family-friendly selections. Apart from the gorgeous, wild-spirited Irish animated folk fantasy <strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/wolfwalkers/umc.cmc.amuoq00hqelfi98j0gvg641x\">Wolfwalkers</a></strong> and the attractively shot but unsurprising nature documentary <strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/the-elephant-queen/umc.cmc.1ybrwww83rknjtwiuuemjfbvq\">The Elephant Queen</a></strong>, Apple TV+’s originals have largely passed over that market. At a push, you could also include this year’s dewy-eyed best picture Oscar winner <strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/coda/umc.cmc.3eh9r5iz32ggdm4ccvw5igiir\">Coda</a></strong>, an inclusive adolescent drama suitable for families who can handle a mild sex joke or two. Browsing the paid-VOD selections yields arguably richer rewards, among them Steven Spielberg’s still-luminous, somehow 40-year-old alien friendship tale <strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/et-the-extra-terrestrial/umc.cmc.y7sdg83ku22c7qmfh4v16q2e\">E</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/et-the-extra-terrestrial/umc.cmc.y7sdg83ku22c7qmfh4v16q2e\">T</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/et-the-extra-terrestrial/umc.cmc.y7sdg83ku22c7qmfh4v16q2e\"> the Extra-Terrestrial</a></strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"125f3702cdc9283c4165dc7018afba328a66b4f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/125f3702cdc9283c4165dc7018afba328a66b4f2/0_0_5400_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wolfwalkers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"541\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ‘gorgeous, wild-spirited’ Wolfwalkers.

But, as with Apple, you have to pay separately for some of the best picks: still, it’s worth a few extra quid for the marvellous farmyard romp <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Babe-James-Cromwell/dp/B00IK9C6GO\">Babe</a></strong> or the lavishly imagined, 80s-tastic fantasy trip <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neverending-Story-Barret-Oliver/dp/B00ET1RR48\">The Neverending Story</a></strong>.</p> <h2><strong>Best of the rest</strong></h2> <p>On Sky/Now TV, subscribers have an easy solution in the full library of <strong><a href=\"https://www.nowtv.com/watch-harry-potter-movies\">Harry Potter</a></strong> sagas, endlessly rewatchable to kids hooked on the mythos. But parents can also try out a solid-gold classic: now in its ninth decade, <strong><a href=\"https://www.nowtv.com/watch/the-wizard-of-oz-1939/A5EK6sKrAayc6uCLdTFfy\">The Wizard of Oz</a></strong> continues to startle children with its transportive, iridescent world-building.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e8645fa06bee6e1b500d5a52fa3b1dc3a6d1706\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e8645fa06bee6e1b500d5a52fa3b1dc3a6d1706/0_0_3824_4985/767.jpg\" alt=\"‘Heart-rending’: The Red Balloon.\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Heart-rending’: The Red Balloon.

Not much has changed.</p> <p>Finally, at the arthouse end of the family-viewing spectrum, you might not expect to find anything for children on Mubi, but for adventurous parents and open-minded young ones, there are discoveries to be made. Children old enough to read subtitles would do well to try out the empathic, child’s-eye social realism of Saudi charmer <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/wadjda\">Wadjda</a></strong>, while the stop-motion French animation <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/my-life-as-a-courgette\">My Life as a Courgette</a></strong> hits a rare balance between adult wisdom and youthful innocence in its portrait of a lonely misfit child finding comfort and community in a rural orphanage. Pair it with some surreal, mirthful wackiness from the platform’s selection of Hungarian animated shorts: <strong><a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/scenes-with-beans\">Scenes With Beans</a></strong> will tickle kids with a penchant for the bizarre.</p> <p>Over on the similarly highbrow BFI Player, two outstanding films fill that tricky gap for emotionally mature children gradually crossing into grownup storytelling. Spanish director Carla Simón’s vibrant, suitably seasonal coming-of-age drama <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-summer-1993-2017-online#:~:text=An%20outstanding%20debut%20feature%20charting,death%20in%20early%201990s%20Spain.\">Summer 1993</a></strong> tackles complex themes of grief and self-worth with a soft, sure touch. Also set over a young girl’s formative summer, meanwhile, Céline Sciamma’s impeccable <strong><a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-tomboy-2011-online\">Tomboy</a></strong> offers an ideal entry point into a 21st-century understanding of gender identity, without ever feeling like a message movie. Who’s to say you can’t sneak a little learning into a summer movie marathon?</p> <h2><strong>New this week on streaming and DVD</strong></h2> <p><strong>Murina</strong> <br>(Modern Films) <br>The winner of last year’s Caméra d’Or for best debut at Cannes, Croatian director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović’s sun-bleached but steel-cool psychodrama promises big things from its Scorsese-endorsed writer-director, but isn’t out to show off.

And I will pack it again and again.</p> <p>If you can’t face layering sunscreen over moisturiser, either because you don’t have the time or because too much product feels unpleasant (I relate), you really need Garnier Ambre Solaire’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/-ambre-solaire-sensitive-face-and-neck-sun-cream-spf50plus-50ml-10153830\" title=\"\">Super UV Anti-Dryness Protection Cream</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/-ambre-solaire-sensitive-face-and-neck-sun-cream-spf50plus-50ml-10153830\" title=\"\"> </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/-ambre-solaire-sensitive-face-and-neck-sun-cream-spf50plus-50ml-10153830\" title=\"\">SPF50+</a></strong> or – for the less dry, more combination-skinned – the same brand’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/ambre-solaire-super-uv-anti-10291969\" title=\"\">Super UV Anti-age Face Protection Cream SPF50+</a></strong>.

What we have here is a rich, gentle but very quickly absorbed formula that plumps up and moisturises the face and neck as much as many expensive day creams, and not only sits obediently under makeup but actually gives it a helpfully grippy base. The inclusion of glycerin – one of my favourite ingredients – gives it a glowy, ever-so-slightly glassy finish that keeps skin looking moist and fresh all day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jul/16/ive-quit-single-use-travel-minis-in-favour-of-refills\">I’ve quit single-use travel minis in favour of refills | Sali Hughes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The anti-age version is also big on hydration: it uses hyaluronic acid to plump up thirsty skin, but also contains niacinamide to soothe sensitivity and help with uneven tone. This is a more fluid version of its sister formula, with an even lighter texture, but is still as agreeable on dry skins as oilier ones. I can’t quite skip a day cream beneath this one, but most will. Both are non-comedogenic (they won’t clog your pores), leave no white cast and can, in my now-extensive experience, be used around the eye area with no ill-effect.</p> <p>For oily types, I’m pleased to report that Bioré, creator of the outstandingly good Aqua Rich Watery Essence sunscreen range, imported from Japan, has recently launched a new face-protecting milk: <strong><a href=\"https://www.stylevana.com/en_GB/deal-kao-biore-uv-aqua-rich-aqua-protect-lotion-spf50-pa-70ml.html?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=freelisting\" title=\"\">Aqua Protect SPF50</a></strong>.

Virgil van Dijk approaches him, observed only by Lassche’s wonderfully wry camera, and informs Van Gaal that he, Virgil van Dijk, will be the first penalty taker in any forthcoming shootout. “Ah…,” Van Gaal says, a look of wonder spreading across his face. “So you’ve become a coach now.”</p> \n<p>“No … no,” Van Dijk stutters. “All I’m saying, what I mean is …” But Van Gaal is already hoisting an eyebrow and laughing weirdly, before getting back to telling Frenkie de Jong to beat his man more often, then scolding the entire squad, with feeling, for standing still in possession.</p> \n<p>The players smile and listen. It’s obvious that they love this old geezer, a Van Gaal who looks pretty startling out there these days, his monolithic head flatter than ever, chiselled like a cliff face, a head that should surely have been designated by now as a Dutch national monument.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/06/koeman-to-succeed-van-gaal-as-netherlands-manager-after-world-cup\">Koeman to succeed Van Gaal as Netherlands manager after World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What the players don’t know is that Van Gaal has a catheter and a colostomy bag fitted under the tracksuit hanging loosely from his shoulders. Or that he will go straight from national team duty to spend his nights in hospital, watching football on an iPhone on his gurney, fighting the after-effects of prostate cancer treatment. By the time the decisive game against Norway comes around he will be in a wheelchair, a legacy (absurdly) of falling off his bike trying to keep up with the players.</p> \n<p>Van Gaal had 25 radiation-therapy sessions before he took the Netherlands job in August 2021. His record since reads: played 13, won nine, drawn four, scored 38. He will take his country to Qatar in November knowing this is the final act in a 50-year career. He’s fragile now, but also luminous and utterly compelling, that famous honesty sharpened to a point by old age and last things.</p> \n<p>Lassche’s film, which will be released in the UK later this year, is seen entirely from the perspective of Van Gaal and the people in his life, directed without voiceover, and with sparse, un-narrated archive. It is a great football film that never really feels like a football film: deeply touching, revelatory in parts, and also very funny because Van Gaal is funny.</p> \n<p>There is a lovely section where Van Gaal is driving with the De Boer twins crammed next to each other in the back of his car while he shouts back from the front seat and they have a wonderful argument about the 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign. Lassche just lets his camera linger on these identical, grouchy looking middle-aged men being lectured by Dad, like a David Lynch dreamscape.</p> \n<p>Later Van Gaal goes to see Erik ten Hag at Ajax, and we hear Ten Hag speaking (pretty good) English to his players before Van Gaal takes over, switches to local tongue and starts with: “Let me just say that in my time you would all be speaking in Dutch”. He pulls Hakim Ziyech to one side. Their exchange goes like this:</p> \n<p>“Hakim Ziyech. I think there’s always room for improvement … do you agree?”</p> \n<p>“Of course.”</p> \n<p>“And do you have a realistic self image?”</p> \n<p>“Yes, always.”</p> \n<p>“The fans have accepted you, despite you giving the ball away too much … that says something.”</p> \n<p>Ziyech says thank you and takes his signed book. Later a reporter asks Van Gaal about his famously overheated media exchanges. “Was your anger always real?” “Yes,” the reply comes. “And that is a stupid question.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bc304c166c26a3aabb0906ec0d9816394b8c510\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bc304c166c26a3aabb0906ec0d9816394b8c510/0_34_2996_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Van Gaal with Wayne Rooney before the 2016 FA Cup final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Van Gaal with Wayne Rooney before the 2016 FA Cup final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Van Gaal also has another habit: he’s good at being right, in a way that might not seem instantly obvious. As all roads lead to the ruins of Rome, this brings us to his time at Manchester United. “Manchester was my most difficult period,” he says. “I came in as manager and everything was disappointing. Most of the players on the squad were over 30. It’s unbelievable, I was at the richest club in the world and I could not buy the players I wanted.”</p> \n<p>Van Gaal talks to Wayne Rooney on Zoom, who drops in casually that he’d never actually worked properly on tactics during his 10-year United career. “I saw you could actually improve us as a team. I’d never worked on team shape before at Manchester United. I’d never done it! I found it so strange,” Rooney says. “Then to go in and constantly do it the way you wanted, I really enjoyed that.”</p> \n<p>Parts of the English press had portrayed Rooney as a kind of remedial man-beast, confused by Van Gaal’s instruction. It turns out he wanted more of this. But then Van Gaal was depicted as a hilarious eccentric throughout his time at United, with talk of mutiny as the players felt the drills and the briefing documents were, you know, a bit of a drag. Van Gaal is going to the World Cup this year. United are still thrashing about in a slough of despond. Perhaps it seems less funny now.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6616464b-85f4-447c-bf8c-15d72fc9cfad\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JjiWMSlRWRM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The sacking is discussed with some new detail about how stark it all was. Van Gaal’s wife, Truus, says: “I knew Louis would be sacked. We had a small boardroom there and it was always fun with the old Manchester legends. [Alex] Ferguson, Bobby Charlton. We had a table with good food and drinks. And suddenly they stopped greeting us, just waved from afar. Something was wrong. Then the man [Ed Woodward, United’s then chief executive] denied it. I said ‘Louis, you’re going to be fired, get wise to it,’ and I slammed the door of the apartment shut.”</p> \n<p>During the FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in 2016 it emerges on social media that José Mourinho has already been hired. “I told Louis, you’ve been fired,” Truus goes on to say. “He got so angry. Why do you have to spoil my party, stop all this negative nonsense. Later he rang me. It’s Louis – you can come home. You were right.” Van Gaal had been sacked, long distance, without a board member in sight. “His voice sounded broken. When I came home I could see he had been crying.”</p> \n<p>Otherwise the film is basically Van Gaal walking into rooms and saying stuff, looking at things, having feelings. Often he’s on a balcony leading a riotous singalong. He watches some gorillas in the wild, staring at them hard, and you half expect him to lean in and start telling them how to eat sugar cane better.</p> \n<p>We stay in the room to see him having his cancer diagnosed, the news taken with total eye contact and hard questions about the realities. He describes having an injection to dampen his testosterone levels. “It completely wipes out the libido, Geertjan. I also have a catheter which doesn’t help when you want to make love,” he adds, giving Lassche one of his wife’s currant buns with cheese. And you realise in these moments that Van Gaal is basically football’s dad. A little maddening, a little wonky and embarrassing, but utterly essential.</p> \n<p>There is football too. Van Gaal meets Edgar Davids, one of his dearest former players, seen here in some startling archive kickabout footage (he really was an absolute miracle). Speaking to his old players, Van Gaal seems to come from some other world outside football, a more priestly, Lutheran tradition of moral absolutes, of right and wrong, of skin scalding instruction.</p> \n<p>The Van Gaal Total Man Principle demands total control, subjugation to the team (and to Louis Van Gaal). This tension is the story of his career in many ways, of the passing of his tactical era, and of the tides in elite modern football, a controlled collectivism that works only when players are able to submit. As Van Gaal talks to Davids the shadow of that great Ajax team rises once again. It took three years to win a title there, and four to become European champions with an average age of 23. Had Van Gaal achieved nothing else from there his name was already set in lights.</p> \n<p><em>Louis will be released in the UK by Vertical Entertainment this autumn.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/30/qasim-sheikh-on-scotlands-cricket-racism-scandal-to-know-others-wont-go-through-this-is-everything","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"Qasim Sheikh on Scotland’s cricket racism scandal: ‘To know others won’t go through this is everything’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/qasim-sheikh-on-scotlands-cricket-racism-scandal-to-know-others-wont-go-through-this-is-everything","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/30/qasim-sheikh-on-scotlands-cricket-racism-scandal-to-know-others-wont-go-through-this-is-everything","fields":{"headline":"Qasim Sheikh on Scotland’s cricket racism scandal: ‘To know others won’t go through this is everything’","trailText":"Former international batter tells Simon Burnton that the day of the report into failings that led the whole board in Scotland to resign was ‘the toughest of my life’","byline":"Simon Burnton","body":"<p>On Wednesday, 48 hours after the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/25/cricket-scotland-faces-special-measures-status-after-racism-report\">the racism report that shook Scottish cricket</a>, Qasim Sheikh and Majid Haq went into the lion’s den.

If I’m honest, the first half an hour in the ground was quite weird. You could see people were on eggshells, which I can understand. As the day went on, a lot of them stared in silence.

They stood with us for a good amount of time, and we had some laughs. Gradually more and more of the national team players came over and showed some solidarity. That’s been lacking up to now.</p> <p>“I went to the ground not sure if I should be there. I was asked: ‘Was I just there to embarrass people?’ In the end I think it was a very important day. The following morning I woke up to 30-odd messages from influential people in Scottish cricket, who are starting to come forward. But it’s absolutely not just about me and Majid – there are many people who have suffered and they all deserve to have these kinds of conversations. They all deserve to be healed.”</p> <p>One thing that is clear from both Sheikh and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/azeem-rafiq\">Azeem Rafiq</a>, whose decision to speak out about his experiences of racism at Yorkshire have forced that county – if not yet the wider English game – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/22/cricket-the-spin-lord-patel-must-see-off-yorkshire-discontent-if-reforms-are-to-work\">into a complete overhaul</a>, is that the moment of vindication is in no way joyful. Sheikh ranks Monday, the day the report was published and he sat in front of a press conference unspooling memories he would much rather never relive, among the most difficult of his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeb1c785f33d94045b5831f15ba8e06687fa47f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb1c785f33d94045b5831f15ba8e06687fa47f1/0_80_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Qasim Sheikh (left) and Majid Haq (right) walk with lawyer Aamer Anwar on their way into Monday’s press conference in Stirling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Qasim Sheikh (left) and Majid Haq (right) walk with lawyer Aamer Anwar on their way into Monday’s press conference in Stirling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Putting your head above the parapet, the emotions you go through are vast,” Rafiq says. “There’ll be days when you feel like: ‘What have you done?’ Because actually the change is extremely slow. It’s not like everything’s going to be great from now onwards and everyone’s going to embrace them.</p> <p>“Eight months on from speaking to the DCMS [the digital, culture, media and sport select committee] I still go through days and weeks in some very dark places. I’m just incredibly proud of them and everyone else who spoke to that review, because it’s not easy to open yourself up and put your life on the table.”</p> <p>When Sheikh was 13 his younger brother, Hamza, died of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, which is one of the memories he has been confronting afresh this week. “I don’t think I’ll ever face a more difficult time. That was tough, it will never leave me,” he says. “But in a different way Monday was the toughest day of my life. My mental health had a wobble when it came to early evening, and the whole overwhelming experience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mental health had a wobble when it came to early evening, and the whole overwhelming experience</p> <footer> <cite>Qasim Sheikh</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“I’m very lucky to have people like Azeem and Majid alongside me, people who have supported me daily when I have had some very up and down moments with my mental health. It’s tough but what drives me is the message I got from a parent to say: ‘You’ve paved the way for my daughter to get equal opportunities in cricket.’ That’s everything to me. There’s no financial gain in this, not a penny. I can live with my career being gone, but to know that others won’t go through this is everything to me.”</p> <p>The hope is that this will come to be seen as the start of a new era not just in Scottish cricket, but across sport in Scotland. On Tuesday the governing body sportscotland, which commissioned the report from Plan4Sport, held a meeting with almost 50 representatives of dozens of other sports to discuss its ramifications.</p> <p>“No one else wants to go through this. No one wants to see a sport in such a place,” says Stewart Harris, the sportscotland CEO. “The independent review was robust and I think there are lots of lessons for all of us to take out of that. The opportunity is a positive one. It’s what we all do from here, not just Cricket Scotland – how we work with other sports to prevent this kind of thing and be open to those who have an interest.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report will force Cricket Scotland – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/24/cricket-scotland-board-resigns-in-advance-of-report-into-racism\">whose entire board resigned</a> on the eve of publication – to undergo massive change. Meanwhile, though this wave hit England months ago, much of the game there remains resolutely untransformed. “What surprises me is they didn’t try in any way to gloss over serious issues,” says Rafiq. “Comparing it to how the Yorkshire situation unfolded, what a difference. Looking at the ECB, there’s been an action plan, lots of tick-boxes, but fundamentally has anything changed? I don’t think it has.”</p> <p>The glacial pace of change in England has not gone unnoticed in Scotland. “We were vindicated up here, but that lad and friend of mine has not been vindicated yet, because the dinosaurs are digging their heels in,” Sheikh said of Rafiq. “If Plan4Sport went under the bonnet of the ECB, I wouldn’t want to imagine what that report would look like. But I’m not finished with this fight. Just because we had a couple of handshakes on Wednesday, that’s just the start.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/30/women-euro-2022-final-england-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"England and Germany meet again for Euros final but goalposts have moved","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/women-euro-2022-final-england-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/30/women-euro-2022-final-england-germany","fields":{"headline":"England and Germany meet again for Euros final but goalposts have moved","trailText":"These sides met in the 2009 Women’s Euros final but that game belongs in a different era – Sunday’s match will show just how far the game has come","byline":"Jonathan Liew","body":"<p>The most striking difference is the feeling of space. Space in the stands and space on the pitch. As England and Germany step out for the final of the 2009 European Championship, the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki is less than half full: the rows of black plastic seats creating their own shade, the noise simply evaporating like steam. In large part this is attributable to the fact that the final – for some mystifying reason – is being played on a Thursday evening in September. Some of the English newspapers haven’t even bothered to send anybody.</p> <p>The crowd of just over 15,000 is treated to a ragged rout: Germany running out 6-2 winners, forcing England’s loose assemblage of mostly semi-pro players to chase them to exhaustion. The level of commitment is unstinting. The level of technical ability is surprisingly good. What’s missing is the intensity: the tactical sophistication, the speed of thought and action, the physical conditioning that allows modern players to sprint and change direction and leap and slide with the same vigour in minute 90 as in minute one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/england-captain-leah-williamson-making-her-mark-without-having-to-tackle\">England captain Williamson making her mark without having to tackle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It feels like ancient history, and in a way it is, and in a way it isn’t. Some of the players involved in that game are still knocking around. The substitute goalkeeper Lisa Weiss is Merle Frohms’s understudy at Wolfsburg. The unsinkable Jill Scott, now 35, has featured for England at this year’s tournament. But the game they were playing then and the game they are playing now may as well be two different sports, existing in two different universes.</p> <p>And so 13 years after Faye White and Birgit Prinz led England and Germany out into a half-empty stadium and a world indifferent to them, Leah Williamson and Alexandra Popp will feel the noise and the claustrophobia of a sold-out Wembley before they have even left the tunnel. These days they are fully-paid professionals and household names. They will sense the millions of eyes upon them, in pubs and living rooms and on phone screens all over the continent. They have both been on this crazy ride long enough to feel the vertigo, to appreciate the distance that has been travelled in such a short span of time.</p> <p>Is it remotely possible to treat this like just another game of football? To know what it all means and to un-know it at the same time? Do you try to harness the emotion and sense of occasion or do you try to block it out? And this is before we even thrash out some of the finer details of this game: the battle between Keira Walsh and Lena Oberdorf for midfield supremacy, Popp’s and Beth Mead’s scrap for the Golden Boot, which team can best sustain the press and which team can best resist it.</p> <p>All of which adds up to what is quite simply one of the most important games of football ever to have taken place in the British Isles. For years, even decades, we have been told that women’s football in England is on the threshold of something big, some indeterminate great leap forward that will propel it from a minor sport into a primetime preoccupation of millions. Nobody really knew what it would look like. But we swore we would all recognise it when we saw it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"131fe06cac25f1b7b2e2f2b493036af144a5ffbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/131fe06cac25f1b7b2e2f2b493036af144a5ffbf/205_333_2640_1584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s players are dejected after Germany score their fifth goal of the Euro 2009 final in Helsinki.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s players are dejected after Germany score their fifth goal of the Euro 2009 final in Helsinki.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>England have been kind but merciless hosts: clinical in front of goal, unashamedly partisan in the stands, a team slowly coming to terms with how good they are. They have blown opposition sides apart (Norway, Northern Ireland, Sweden) when they have had the chance and ground them down (Austria, Spain) when they have not. Most of all they have played the sort of football of which their predecessors could only dream: well-drilled, robust, full of meme-able skill and millennial panache, enriched by the very highest available quality of coaching, logistics and sports science.</p> <p>The danger is in taking a breath, in stopping to admire the view, in dwelling for even a second on the magnitude of what they might achieve. This is why Germany are the single most dangerous side they could possibly face. If there is any team better equipped to handle the occasion, it is the team that have been in eight previous finals and won the lot, whose culture and collective muscle memory is calibrated for games like this, who will not simply handle the pressure of this monumental away fixture but relish it, reflect it, turn it on their hosts like a mirror.</p> <p>Germany have been ruthlessly efficient with their chances and ruthlessly competitive without the ball. They have absorbed pressure better than any team in the tournament. Frohms has been inspired. Popp, playing her first Euros at the age of 31 after missing the 2013 and 2017 tournaments through injury, has been a talismanic presence: brilliant in the air, brilliant at sniffing out chances in the penalty area and a wise, calming head in the dressing room. Germany have been on their own journey, and strengthened a little with every step.</p> <p>If Germany are a team that seem to be shedding baggage as they go, then in a way England are the opposite. History-makers, trailblazers, heroes: the inevitable wave of adulation and recognition that would greet an England victory is its own inhibiting force. Playing Germany in a major championship final on home soil is hard enough without also shouldering the burden of leadership, of advocacy, of giving this addled country something to feel fleetingly proud about.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/readers-on-euro-2022-and-womens-football\">‘So refreshing and joyful’: readers on Euro 2022 and women’s football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet if England’s players are best served ignoring the wider context, the rest of us can feel quietly moved at the sense of progress. That 2009 side under Hope Powell were playing on annual retainers worth about £16,000 a year. The Women’s Super League was still a concept that would not be made flesh until 2010. Women’s football was still a sport of volunteers and pioneers: players and coaches working for free, lending their own time and money and grimacing into freezing rain in the vain hope that one day their successors might find the going a little easier.</p> <p>Perhaps in another 13 years we will look back on this team and gasp again at the speed of ascent. All the same, any talk of a lasting legacy should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. The sugar rush of emotion that England’s players have generated over the past few weeks is essentially separate to the slow work of real change, a process that is not enacted by a single game of football, but which requires patience and political will and above all strategy and investment. Meanwhile the sight of five all-white starting XIs gives the lie to the idea that these women are somehow representative of us as a nation. Much has been achieved. Much more still needs to be. Winning or losing against Germany does not change any of that.</p> <p>And so this is a day for wondering not where this team might go next, but gazing in wonder at how far they have come.

That’s what women’s sport is giving sponsors now, people actually seeing what a brand represents.</p> <p>“Women’s football has had no airtime on traditional media, so we’ve had to create our own content and create our own buzz.

When domestic leagues start again, it’s the job of the clubs and the FA to keep attendance high and maintain the same level of interest.”</p> <p>Tongue said too many people still perceive women’s football as a grassroots sport where players take part for the love of the game, rather a full-blown professional spectacle.</p> <p>In particular, clubs need to move on from playing at remote non-league grounds with limited facilities and little opportunity to entertain corporate clients with the high-level treatment many have come to expect, she said.</p> <p>“There is not an opportunity to take clients to WSL games because there are no hospitality options.

Why do the presenters talk to each other so oddly? And why does no one seem to know what Channel 4’s new show even is?<br>","byline":"Joel Golby","body":"<p>I think we can all agree that, over the past 25 years or so, Channel 4 has been the market leader when it comes to property television. Come on, just admit it. Do you really want to do this? Do you want to bring up DIY SOS, again? Do you want to fight with me over the magician-glam of Homes Under the Hammer’s Martin Roberts? You do not. The best property TV in this country has consistently revolved round the holy trinity of McCloud, Allsopp and Spencer, and is always best when showing wide-eyed middle-class cash buyers pour concrete in such a way that their marriage nearly ends. So it is, so it always was.</p> <p>What has messed with this system is “the real world”, which, if you’ve dabbled anywhere near the property market in the last few years, you will know is very bad. It is close to impossible for a generation of young people to even buy a starter home. That ripple effect is working itself up the age and income brackets. It affects rents and postcodes and how close communities can be. Property TV has to adapt to a world where the idea of even owning property is now absurdly aspirational. As a result, the teatimely hour-longs need to lower their sights from “This is a showstopper foyer!” to “Yeah maybe that bit under the stairs could be a bedroom”. And so: Worst House on the Street (Tuesday, 8pm, Channel 4).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Brother-sister duo Scarlette and Stuart Douglas sometimes speak to each other as if they’ve just met in a queue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>WHOTS is fronted by brother-sister developer duo Scarlette and Stuart Douglas, who are quite good but also sometimes speak to each other as if they’ve just met in a queue. You might remember them from helping prop up George Clarke’s Flipping Fast, a sort of yassified Homes Under the Hammer from earlier this year that I found quite ghoulish: six teams were handed £100k and given a year to make profit on as many properties as possible. Absolutely all of them were idiot amateurs, and not one of them failed to make money (one team bought a house, spent three months painting every room white, then sold for a £19k profit: that seems very normal and good!).</p> <p>I am not saying property TV needs to make moral judgments on the state of the market (“Just tidying up this garden makes the property worth £20,000 more. That’s actually really bad, by the way”), but it did always feel as if it was tiptoeing round a large, honking elephant in the room. Property TV has to adapt to reflect a market that has been irreparably damaged by property TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac217a8fcdc5f53aafce058580af547add4457a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac217a8fcdc5f53aafce058580af547add4457a1/0_99_3050_1830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Estate of the nation … Worst House on the Street presenters Stuart and Scarlette Douglas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> Estate of the nation … Worst House on the Street presenters Stuart and Scarlette Douglas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones /Channel Four</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyway, Worst House on the Street, the concept of which is … well, um. It’s actually quite hard to tell. Nominally, it’s about people buying a bad house and renovating it into a good one. This week we meet a cheerful young couple, Harry and Yimika, and interview their neighbours about the house they’ve just bought, which is apparently an eyesore (neighbours complaining about a house whose visual aesthetic might drag down the value of their own property is arguably peak “British TV”) – and occasionally Stuart and Scarlette pop in and offer vague advice. “Buy a kitchen counter straight from the supplier instead of a showroom” is about 10 minutes of this episode. Thank you, experts. Never would have thought of that.<br><br>But, crucially, no one on WHOTS seems to know what it is. Harry and Yimika are constantly saying this is their first home, that they’ve sacrificed so much to buy it and they want to turn it into a dream family property, and Stuart and Scarlette are constantly talking about how much value they are adding. Scarlette is particularly obsessed with saying a very minor change has added 5% – apparently changing the bathroom taps and tiles did just that, which (and yes I am petty enough to do the maths) equated to £20,000. We are constantly being told that the couple’s renovation budget is “only” £40,000.</p> <p>And then there’s some contradictory advice: Harry and Yimika are dead-set on taking the chimney breasts out of four rooms, which would create more livable space for them, but are sternly talked out of it. Instead, they spend the same amount on a porch to add “kerb appeal”, and later we see them tiptoe-squeeze between the end of their bed and the jutting-out chimney breast. You really have to think: have they made this house nice for themselves to live in, or slightly nicer for the next person to buy? Nobody ever seems to know who they’re doing it for. So maybe, actually, this is the TV that most accurately reflects the state of the market as it is now.

Dating from the 12th century, the pendant was designed to hang from a horse harness, its motif picked out in red enamel and gold.</p> <p>Medieval horse harness pendants are not rare and frequently turn up in excavations, yet they tend to be very worn, according to archaeologists. In contrast, “the condition of this object is quite remarkable and it is very rare to see a horse harness pendant like this from an archaeological context in such a fine state of preservation,” said Dr Dawn McLaren of Connect Archaeology.</p> <p>Most of the red enamel and some of the gilding are still present, particularly on areas of the object that were less likely to be weathered while it was in use. Archaeologists suspect the object, barely 2cm in breadth, may have become detached from its fitting while in use, and was quite new when lost.</p> <p>The three lions motif has been associated with the arms of England since King Henry II (1133-1189) added a lion to the two previously displayed by William the Conqueror, probably to represent his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine. The heraldic symbol – strictly, in this case, “gules, three lions passant guardant” – was in use by the Crown between 1189 and 1340, and have been associated with the English throne in various forms ever since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2022/jul/29/england-germany-euro-2022-final-womens-football-weekly-podcast\">History awaits England’s Lionesses at Wembley – Women’s Football Weekly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Football Association has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jul/18/theknowledge.sport#:~:text=The%20short%20answer%20is%20that,the%20logo%20of%20the%20FA.\">using the three lions symbol </a>(more commonly with the lions in blue) since the late 19th century; a version of it is also used by <a href=\"https://www.ecb.co.uk/\">cricket’s ECB</a>.</p> <p>The pendant, while medieval, was found close to a late series of Late iron age and Romano-British enclosures being excavated as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/hs2\">ongoing HS2 development</a>.

I picked a line and Felix, the boat’s mate, tapped a different one as he passed and said with a grin: “That one might work better.”</p> <p>Had I untied my initial choice I might have brought the boat’s huge mainsail crashing down on our heads. Felix was still smiling, though, as he gave instructions to two of the other five guests standing on the foredeck. We were four hours into our first day on board and were still, quite literally, learning the ropes, though the satisfaction of seeing the sails fill high above the deck was worth any missteps. We were rewarded with a shift in power as the wooden hull drove through the water, the sea spray began to fly, and we began to feel we were an essential part of bringing the boat to life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0e72323a55d1fc8e0c0a0dedb997b9836f11eb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e72323a55d1fc8e0c0a0dedb997b9836f11eb4/0_223_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boatbuilder Luke Powell relaxing on deck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boatbuilder Luke Powell relaxing on deck</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: unknown/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The frenetic activity of sailing was interspersed with regular lulls in which coffee and cake appeared, and meals that were improbably impressive given the tiny size of the boat’s galley. There was time, too, to watch out for wildlife. Along this stretch of coast I had seen a minke whale and a pod of common dolphins in the previous weeks, though the sea state that morning meant we were unlikely to spot either, even if they were there. Instead, we watched gannets dive, bullet-like, into the dark water, and guillemots and Manx shearwaters as they skimmed the waves. On the other side of the boat, the coastline of the Roseland peninsula looked almost entirely unspoiled.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Had I untied my initial choice I might have brought the boat’s huge mainsail crashing down on our heads</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Constructed by the renowned boatbuilder Luke Powell, Agnes is a replica of the pilot cutter that served the Scilly island from which it took its name. From the outside at least, Agnes looks much as its namesake would have done in the mid-1800s. At that time, Agnes was used to guide ships through the treacherous maze of shallow waters and hidden ledges around the island archipelago that lies 28 miles off the Cornish coast. Competition for business was fierce, with the first boat out to an incoming ship earning the commission for bringing it in safely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4049bd5172e776f221b171a622cfd6c1a2d1d81b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4049bd5172e776f221b171a622cfd6c1a2d1d81b/0_378_3930_2358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from Fowey looking across the harbour to Polruan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from Fowey, which proved pleasantly calm after an uncomfortable swell, looking across the harbour at Polruan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: boymonster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our small band of sailors, most of whom had met earlier that day, might not have passed muster with the captains of old, though. Gabe told me enthusiasm and willingness to learn were more important on this trip than experience. While most of us had sailed before, one freely admitted he did not know one end of a halyard from the other. I had been sailing, though mainly on dinghies with my children. But a boat like Agnes – with few of the technologies of modern vessels –<em> </em>is a leveller, emerging from another time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/05/thames-barge-holiday-uk-coast-snark-sailing-trip\">Hoist the sails – if you feel like it: a Thames barge break</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the uncomfortable sea swell, the calm of Fowey was welcome and we moored beneath the blue-and-white frontage of Ferryside, the house where Daphne du Maurier lived in the late 1920s. As we sat on deck in the evening calm, a heron flew across the water and landed silently in the shallows between us and Du Maurier’s house. We listened to owls hooting at one another in the woods above the water, as a hectic day gave way to a quiet night.</p> <p>By the time Du Maurier arrived in Cornwall, boats such as Agnes were already a thing of the past, pushed out by the more powerful Falmouth pilot cutters that muscled in on their territory, then superseded by steamships that did not need to stop at the Isles of Scilly before reaching the mainland. Boatbuilders such as Powell, with their passion for the high-performance crafts of the time, have kept their spirit alive, and Cornwall is all the richer for it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5533e857779bda8e7a9f868b1735d31854916098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5533e857779bda8e7a9f868b1735d31854916098/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gannets in flight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gannets in flight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karl Redshaw/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Agnes’s decks might have felt like home to the original crews, they would not have recognised our quarters, with their neat galley, saloon with small library, and comfortable bunks. There is little in the way of privacy on a boat this size, though the upside is that everyone gets to know everyone else quickly. Over supper, and manoeuvring around each other in the snug cabin, we bonded over stories that ranged from making wine in England to life as a cameraman on EastEnders. Then we collapsed, exhausted, into our bunks.</p> <p>We woke to the splash of oars and the cries of the cox of one of Fowey’s gig crews, out for weekend training. The water was already busy with taxis and fishing boats, and as I drank tea on deck, an immaculately dressed elderly man passed silently by on a beautiful one-man steam launch. These quiet moments on board, watching the comings and goings of a temporarily waterborne community, are always among my favourites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"274f77ac8d70c9cae88ad27f5a60a417e9b51b2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/274f77ac8d70c9cae88ad27f5a60a417e9b51b2f/0_15_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agne in full sail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agnes in full sail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Terry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the weekend continued, we began to move around the boat with increasing confidence. We started to anticipate what would need to be done before we were told and, by the end, we were all talking confidently about topping lifts and staysails. In the space of a long weekend, we went from being a disparate group of travellers to a small, and slightly more competent, band of sailors. We were not necessarily slick, but we were beginning to get there, and returning to Falmouth I found myself wondering if I could stow away in this beautifully recreated piece of the past for another trip.</p> <p>To sit at the helm of a boat such as Agnes as it surges through the water is to feel connected to the wind and the waves, and to know you have tamed some of nature’s forces to propel yourself across the sea. Agnes is a boat for those who dream of the golden age of sail and want to taste it for themselves. Sure, there are easier and faster ways to get from Falmouth to Fowey and back, but certainly none as romantic.<br></p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 August 2022.

The former US president’s 90-minute speech at a luxury hotel <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/27/trumps-2022-pitch-crime-sounds-just-like-his-2015-one/\">was eerily reminiscent</a> of the nativist-populist campaign that won him the White House in 2016. But while Trump himself never evolves, his audience this time around was different.</p> <p>While the <a href=\"https://americafirstpolicy.com/\">America First Policy Institute (AFPI)</a>, a rightwing thinktank, was happy to indulge the garrulous showman at its inaugural summit, it also maintained a cold-eyed focus on the future. Over two days Trump’s allies and alumni laid out a blueprint for a return to power and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/26/trump-second-term-plan/\">a second term</a> more authoritarian, more extreme and more ruthless than the first.</p> <p>The institute – evidently untroubled by the associations of the phrase “America First” with Nazi sympathisers who wanted to keep the US out of the second world war – has 150 staff, including nine former Trump administration cabinet officials and more than 50 former senior staff and officials. Familiar faces such as Kellyanne Conway, Larry Kudlow and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SmithInAmerica/status/1551681756302135296?s=20&amp;t=W6_OlDRBi6ejs7n92zD-jA\">Mark Meadows</a> were feted at the conference.</p> <p>The AFPI is led by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrookeLRollins\">Brooke Rollins</a>, a former domestic policy adviser in the White House, who boasted how the 15-month-old organisation put “boots on the ground” in 32 states on issues from “election integrity to school choice and patriotic education to health care transparency to taxes and spending to fatherhood initiatives to border security to big tech censorship”.</p> <p>The institute has sued Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for alleged censorship, she added, while fighting Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates all the way to the supreme court and opposing his Build Back Better plan for climate and social spending.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e00c4b2efce109b0696273a7c48f1f76005d1d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e00c4b2efce109b0696273a7c48f1f76005d1d0/0_271_8171_4906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"America First prayer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republican lawmakers and audience members pray at the America First gathering.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/17/trump-thinktank-america-first-policy-institute\">described the AFPI as a “grift”</a> for Trump hangers-on to make money but others perceive a “White House in waiting”, determined to avoid the mistakes of his uniquely turbulent presidency and, through 22 “policy centres”, guarantee the survival of Trumpism beyond Trump.</p> <p>Conway, a former senior counselor to the president, told the Guardian: “It certainly is a way to preserve the legacy and for some people it’s also a way to make sure that the entire body of work of the America First movement is all in one place<em>. </em>It’s about policies and principles, not about personalities and politics.<em>”</em></p> <p>She added: “I actually believe, and I’ve heard Brooke Rollins say more than once or twice, privately and publicly, that we have this in place in case President Trump runs again and, if he doesn’t, then it’s in place for whomever runs again.</p> <p>“Whoever the Republican nominee is next time, whether it’s Trump or someone else, will run the way all of these Republican candidates for House and Senate and governor this time, with very few exceptions if any, are running on the America First agenda. They all are doing that this time.<em>”</em></p> <p>The summit revelled in apocalyptic portrayals of Biden and Democrats posing an existential threat to the American way of life. It also described America First principles such as making the economy work for all, putting patients and doctors back in charge of healthcare, protecting the second amendment right to bear arms and giving parents more control over the education of their children.</p> <p>The list of priorities included “finish the wall, deliver peace through strength, make America energy independent, make it easy to vote and hard to cheat, fighting government corruption by draining the swamp”.</p> <p>Handouts of reading material offered another insight. A “parent toolkit” warned of the perils of “wokeness”, “critical race theory” and “the 1619 Project”, citing examples such as an elementary school in Philadelphia that “forced fifth-grade students to simulate a black power rally”. It offered advice on how to run for school boards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ff40fbe1f097d88d8a3ddfe112b030a3d22d5dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ff40fbe1f097d88d8a3ddfe112b030a3d22d5dd/2389_0_3403_4254/800.jpg\" alt=\"Trump and Rollins\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brooke Rollins with Donald Trump in July 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An op-ed by Rollins about the supreme court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion quoted the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands war: “Just rejoice at that news.”</p> <p>A document on school safety and gun violence emphasised fortifying schools, improving access to mental health services and “understanding the relationship between culture and violence” rather than limiting access to firearms. Another paper was entitled: “Fatherlessness and its effects on American society”.</p> <p>During one panel discussion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rick-perry\">Rick Perry</a>, a former energy secretary, insisted that the next Republican administration would not be “genuflecting at the altar of the religion of environmentalism”, adding: “We don’t need to apologise to anybody for being for fossil fuels and how they have changed the world that we live in today, the flourishing of the world.”</p> <p>The gathering also heard about plans to follow through on what Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist, described as the “deconstruction of the administrative state”, centralising power in the presidency like other strongmen around the world.</p> <p>In his speech on Tuesday, Trump said: “We need to make it much easier to fire rogue bureaucrats who are deliberately undermining democracy or, at a minimum, just want to keep their jobs. Congress should pass historic reforms empowering the president to ensure that any bureaucrat who is corrupt, incompetent or unnecessary for the job can be told – did you ever hear this? – ‘You’re fired. Get out. You’re fired.’ Have to do it. Deep state.”</p> <p>The comments followed recent in-depth media reporting about the dramatic scope and scale of planning for President Trump 2.0. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/07/22/trump-2025-radical-plan-second-term\">The Axios website described</a> how his aides are aiming to transform the federal government by replacing thousands of civil servants with loyalists to him and America First.</p> <p>Axios wrote that the plan owes much to an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/07/22/trump-presidency-schedule-f-federal-employees\">executive order known as “Schedule F”</a> that was secretly developed in the second half of Trump’s presidency only to be thwarted by his election defeat.</p> <p>The site added: “The impact could go well beyond typical conservative targets such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Internal Revenue Service. Trump allies are working on plans that would potentially strip layers at the justice department – including the FBI, and reaching into national security, intelligence, the state department and the Pentagon, sources close to the former president say.”</p> <p>The AFPI could prove central to this authoritarian vision. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/29/newt-gingrich-democrats-brainwash-next-generation-trump-us-politics\">Newt Gingrich</a>, a former speaker of the House of Representatives, drew a comparison with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank that he said was crucial to the Ronald Reagan administration, to the extent that Reagan gave each cabinet secretary a copy of its experts’ report and told them to implement it.</p> <p>“The America First Policy Institute is going to do for the next few years what the Heritage Foundation did in 1979, 1980,” Gingrich said. “I think because of the experience over four years under President Trump, we have a seasoned enough cadre that, if we work at it methodically, we can actually have enormous impact on profoundly reshaping the federal government.<em>”</em></p> <p>Trump remained the undisputed master of the AFPI universe in Washington, with some panelists expressing nostalgic yearning for what they perceived as the golden age of his presidency, seemingly oblivious to the revelations of the congressional committee investigating his role in the deadly January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.</p> <p>Rollins described him as “one of the greatest Americans of all time”. Board chair Linda McMahon added: “Our nation greatly misses President Trump and we need his voice and perspective more than ever.” Senator Lindsey Graham opined that Trump was “good” for the Republican party and proclaimed: “I hope he runs again.”</p> <p>But the thinktank is also seeking to trace an ideological thread in the chaos and carnage of the Trump years, laying the foundation for the future of America First after he has left the political stage or if the mantle passes to another Republican such as Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marc_lotter?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Marc Lotter</a>, chief communications officer at AFPI, said: “There’s no question that President Trump is the visionary that put all this in place and started it but the voters will decide who should carry that leadership forward and, if they’re America First, then they’ll have the benefit of our work.”</p> <p>He added: “One of the differences between AFPI and many of our fellow folks in the conservative think space is we were actually the ones there doing it in the White House and so know what you need to do when you hit the ground running, whether it is in January ’23, when America First retakes control of Congress, or in a state house or a governor’s office, or eventually in ’25 in the White House. That’s what we’re preparing for.”</p> <p>Policy experts remain sceptical of the AFPI. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston</a>, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: “I looked at the website yesterday and I was astonished by the number of people who appear to be in salaried positions and also by the unimpressive and unoriginal quality of what they turned out on the policy front.</p> <p>“A small team of legislative assistants to a Republican congressman could have written papers with those titles in a week because there’s nothing very original about being pro-patriotic and pro-family in the Republican party. Let me know if they come up with anything more impressive than that.”</p> <p>But Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, also noted the Axios report about Trump acolytes’ plans to purge disloyal civil servants. “A second Trump term would be even more dangerous than the first because they now realise how unprepared they were to assume power,” he added.</p> <p>“I don’t think they’re going to make that same mistake again, and they now have a much clearer idea of what to do to institutionalise their power should they regain it. The next two and a half years will be a game for very high stakes in the United States.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/jul/30/speed-up-mental-health-care-uk-children-report-nhs-four-weeks","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"£1bn needed to speed up mental health care for UK children, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/30/speed-up-mental-health-care-uk-children-report-nhs-four-weeks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jul/30/speed-up-mental-health-care-uk-children-report-nhs-four-weeks","fields":{"headline":"£1bn needed to speed up mental health care for UK children, report says","trailText":"Call for ‘once in a generation’ package for NHS so young people can receive treatment within four weeks","byline":"Patrick Butler Social policy editor","body":"<p>Children needing mental health services should be guaranteed treatment within four weeks, with next-day referrals for those at risk of self-harm and suicide, according to an inquiry into the explosion in demand from young people for psychiatric help.</p> <p>The inquiry by the <a href=\"https://thecommissiononyounglives.co.uk/\">Commission on Young Lives</a>, chaired by the former children’s commissioner for England Anne Longfield, said a “once in a generation” £1bn recovery package was needed to boost an overstretched NHS system too often forced to turn away unwell youngsters.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/12/mindfulness-schools-does-not-improve-mental-health-study\">“rising tide” of poor mental health</a> in which incidences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/18/children-stressed-and-self-harming-uk-cost-of-living-crisis-childhood-trust\">self-harm</a>, attempted suicide, anxiety, eating disorders and behavioural difficulties were more extreme and frequent, was overwhelming attempts by NHS services to offer timely and consistent help to youngsters, it said.</p> <p>Longfield said children’s mental health had gone from being “hardly on the radar” as a Whitehall policy issue just five years ago to a national emergency. She said: “The scale of the problem is growing, rocket-boosted by the pandemic, and the system is buckling under pressure and unable to cope with the explosion in demand for help.”</p> <p>In March, 90,789 young people were referred to NHS children and young people’s mental health services, the highest figure since records began, the inquiry said. It cited school leaders and youth workers who said dealing with young people who self-harm or make suicide attempts was now “a regular part of their professional lives”.</p> <p>Overall, one in six children aged six to 16 have a probable mental health problem – a “huge increase” from one in nine in 2017, the report said.</p> <p>However, in some cases high thresholds for care meant young people suffering from serious mental health conditions were refused NHS treatment until they could show they had made “multiple suicide attempts with serious intent”, the inquiry said.</p> <p>The commission cited the case of a teenage boy discharged from hospital after trying to take his own life who 10 days later had not been contacted by mental health services. A young woman discharged from A&amp;E after a suicide attempt was not contacted by mental health staff for a fortnight despite daily pleas for help from her parents.</p> <p>Those who were referred for treatment commonly entered a postcode lottery of waiting times. The average wait was 32 days, though this ranged from six days in some English regions to 81 in others. Just 23% of children referred to services started treatment within four weeks, according to latest figures covering 2020-21.</p> <p>Longfield added: “The overall response from the government to this children’s mental health crisis has so far been too slow and inadequate, and we are failing to support hundreds of thousands of children with mental health problems. It is shocking to hear that some young people who attempt suicide still do not receive an immediate referral for help and are discharged without any extra support.”</p> <p>Although the inquiry gave credit to the government and NHS England for “the very real improvements” in children’s mental health services in recent years”, including the rollout of mental health teams in schools, the programme was patchy and “losing the battle against rocketing demand” for help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Olly Parker, the head of external affairs at charity YoungMinds, said it echoed the commission’s concerns.

But the reality is that with every month of uncertainty and inaction, things are getting rapidly worse for young people.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring children can access the support and resources they need, as early as possible.</p> <p>“We’re continuing to take action to support their mental health – including £79m to ensure 22,000 more children and young people can access community mental health services, as well as to expand mental health support teams in schools to reach 3 million pupils by 2024. </p> <p>“This is on top of our record investment to expand and transform services giving an additional 345,000 children access to support by 2024 and expanding the children’s mental health workforce by more than 40%.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

When news broke that Vardy had lost her libel case against Coleen Rooney, she joined this heady roster of celebrities who have launched brain-bogglingly misguided and self-wounding legal cases. Like Wilde – who sued the Marquess of Queensberry for revealing his homosexuality – Vardy went to court to deny something that a rock could see was true: she’d passed on private stories about Rooney to the press. And like Streisand – who sued a website for featuring an image of her house, thereby drawing the world’s attention to it – she believed going to court was the best way to control her image. She was wrong.</p> <p>Vardy traded private details of her husband’s colleagues and their wives in the hope of currying positive coverage in the media. And because of that, Mrs Justice Steyn delivered a verdict that was even more of a character assassination than Vardy’s own memorable description of Rooney to a Daily Mail journalist: “Arguing with Coleen Rooney would be as pointless as arguing with a pigeon: you can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it’s still going to shit in your hair.” Well, Rebekah, you’re covered in shit now.</p> <p>I sat just a few yards from Vardy every day of the trial, and it was obvious that she deserved to lose this case. But it was not always obvious she would do so. Rooney took a big risk in publicly accusing Vardy – or, to be precise “It’s………Rebekah Vardy’s account” – of leaking stories about her to the tabloids, because in English law the burden of proof falls on the person who made the defamatory claim. She took an even bigger risk in refusing to back down even after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/20/rebekah-vardy-wins-in-first-stage-of-coleen-rooney-libel-action\">Mr Justice Warby decreed in November 2020</a> that Rooney would have to prove Vardy herself was the source of the leaks, not just someone with access to Vardy’s account.</p> <p>Yet from the first day of the trial, Rooney, who sat every day alongside her husband, Wayne, radiated certainty and sanity, like a holy figure in a painting by Vermeer, waiting for their blessing. Vardy, by contrast, was more like a character on Dynasty, hysterically crying and collapsing in the witness box as Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, repeatedly read out her own words, from WhatsApp messages and tabloid interviews, that disproved Vardy’s claims.</p> <p>Did she leak stories? No she did not. So why had she sent a WhatsApp telling her agent, Caroline Watt: “Leak the story about her shagging G behind H’s back?” Did she endorse revealing personal details about other people? No she did not. So why did she do a kiss and tell about Peter Andre in 2004 in which she described him as “hung like a chipolata”?</p> <p>And this was the evidence we did see. So much we did not. Watt’s phone, which somehow ended up at the bottom of the North Sea, and endless WhatsApp messages on Vardy and her husband Jamie’s phones that mysteriously vanished – these should be discussed alongside the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Colossus of Rhodes as mythical objets d’art that were tragically lost to mankind.</p> <p>Justice Steyn concluded that their disappearance was “not accidental” and it was “likely that Ms Vardy deliberately deleted her WhatsApp chat with Ms Watt, and that Ms Watt deliberately dropped her phone into the sea”. Vardy probably isn’t buzzing – to use one of her favourite terms – at that ruling, but she can console herself that at least the judge didn’t accept Vardy’s own barrister’s argument that she would have to have been “very clever or very cynical” to delete her WhatsApps. In other words, that she was too thick to bin her own messages. Better too cynical than too thick, Becky.</p> <p>And Justice Steyn clearly thinks Vardy was very cynical indeed. At the trial, Vardy tried to chuck Watt into the North Sea (although probably not to retrieve her phone) by insisting that, if Watt did leak stories to the Sun, she did so without Vardy’s knowledge, consent or approval. Justice Steyn writes simply: “I reject that contention.” I wonder what made her think that? Oh maybe, the various messages from Vardy to Watt saying “leak it” and “I want paying for this”.</p> <p>The index to Justice Steyn’s ruling is endearingly revealing in its own way: “The Flooded Basement Post”; “The Soho House Posts”; “Ms Rooney’s Decision to Remove Ms Vardy as a Follower”. This is what that £3m trial was ultimately about: whether someone blabbed that Rooney’s basement flooded and other similarly newsworthy stories, and Vardy being annoyed at her removal from Rooney’s Instagram. The argument between the two women, Justice Steyn concluded, “can fairly be described as trivial, but it does not need to be important to meet the sting of libel … The essential sting of libel has been shown to be true”.</p> <p>Vardy has been well and truly stung. Perhaps, to paraphrase and homage her own immortal words about pigeons, that rare but apparently possible phenomenon of shitting in your own hair can now be known as The Vardy effect.</p> <p>And what of Rooney? Not since her husband scored a hat-trick in his Old Trafford debut has a Rooney scored so magnificently. Her Wagatha sleuthing might have showed heretofore hidden canniness, but it was her strength during the trial that really left an impression. She didn’t even blink at references to her husband’s repeated infidelities, didn’t stumble under questioning, but conducted herself like someone who truly has the courage of her convictions, and her convictions are that you don’t cross Coleen or her family. Vardy, by contrast, couldn’t even look at Rooney, and the only conviction she seems to have is an appetite for the shallowest kind of fame. Well, she’s got it now.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 30 July 2022.

The second, much less pleasant sound is the high, pained yelp of Ned Beatty, squealing like a pig to appease the depraved stranger violating him. So crucial are both to the enduring power of John Boorman’s 1972 nightmare in the boonies that the first can’t help but evoke the second: five decades later, that banjo tune still sounds like a warning – an omen of danger ahead, especially the kind that lies off the beaten path, south of the Mason-Dixon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/13/cabaret-50-bob-fosse-liza-minnelli-musical\">Cabaret at 50: Bob Fosse’s show-stopping musical remains a dark marvel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s a version of America nearly extinct, the more wild and dangerous one traversed by the explorers of legend, that the four city slickers of Deliverance go searching for on their ill-fated canoe trip down the fictional Cahulawassee River. Revisiting the film, on the verge of its 50th anniversary, feels like its own choppy expedition into the rough-and-tumble past. When else but the heyday of New Hollywood could a shocking survival thriller featuring an infamously grueling scene of sexual violence become one of the biggest hits of the year?</p> <p>Deliverance didn’t just make money and the careers of most of its cast. It earned strong reviews, too, and picked up some major academy award nominations, even inching its way into the best picture race. (It would lose the big one to a more sweeping portrait of American violence, The Godfather.) Boorman, the British genre specialist who made the Lee Marvin existential noir Point Blank, situated the film at the intersection of prestige and exploitation. Depending on who you ask, it’s either a sturdy studio drama jolted alive with B-movie savagery or a B action picture with pretensions of seriousness.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sckWeXMLsac\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sckWeXMLsac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Written by James Dickey, faithfully adapting his own 1970 novel, Deliverance quickly, cleanly lays out its trajectory through the ventricles of a heart of darkness. Gathering for some old-fashioned male bonding by way of wilderness adventure are four businessmen from Atlanta: the self-aggrandizing macho bully Lewis (Burt Reynolds), thoughtful strummer Drew (Ronny Cox), good-sport accountant Bobby (Beatty), and level-headed audience surrogate Ed (Jon Voight). Together they’ll cross a stretch of Georgia on a rushing river destined to become a still lake, thanks to a dam being constructed by the state.</p> <p>Lewis, presumably named for one of America’s most famous adventurers, complains of such “progress”, waxing nostalgic about an America untouched by industry. “We’re going to rape this landscape,” he sighs – one of several lines of dialogue that foreshadows the hellish gauntlet to come. When Ed later notes that “No one can find us up here,” he’s relishing the seclusion of their sojourn off the grid, unaware that he’ll come to regret it. One dark irony of the film is that it gives these four men an extreme version of what they’re supposedly seeking: a more primeval America, further from civilization than they bargained for.</p> <p>You could call Deliverance the “reputable”, mainstream cousin to contemporaneous classics of deep-south-west mayhem like The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Boorman’s backwoods bogeymen aren’t quite as inhuman as the cannibalistic redneck monsters of those movies, but they’re still ghoulish caricatures, fulfilling the quintessential stereotype of the rural south as an enclave of toothless, depraved cousin-fuckers. It’s pure turf war on the banks of the river, the endless national conflict between city and country values given a grotesquely visceral shape. Still, however much the film made the Peach state look like a playground for inbred deviants, it also spurred tourism to the area, boosted the whitewater rafting industry, and helped turn Georgia into the go-to Hollywood filming locale it is today.</p> <p>Boorman’s action has a ruthless spontaneity, born of the bumbling nature of the exploits – all of these characters are in over their heads, figuratively and literally – and the reckless conditions of a shoot that cut corners and risked injury. (That there were no stunt doubles becomes shockingly clear during the scenes on the river, the film’s stars plainly plummeting off their canoes.) The most notorious moment, when Bobby is brutalized by the gun-toting rapist, has lost none of its queasy intensity: its awful hicksploitation power comes from the way Boorman cuts dispassionately from stark wide shots to closeups that conceal the sexual violence while centering Beatty’s simulated anguish. It seems to go on forever – and in fact, Reynolds later claimed that Boorman kept the camera running for an uncomfortably long time, until he stepped in to object.</p> <p>This was, of course, the film that made Reynolds a movie star. Which makes sense, as he’s downright iconic in the role, a magnetically obnoxious cowboy blowhard. Boorman basks in his rugged sex appeal but also slyly subverts it, both in emphasizing Lewis’s brutish cruelty and in eventually reducing him to a mewling shell of himself, all his machismo drained out of him by a gnarly fracture of the femur. It’s possible to read Deliverance as an indictment of America’s obsession with traditional masculinity. Where does Lewis’s back-to-nature trial of manhood lead but physical and psychological destruction? And what is Bobby’s heinous ordeal but a kind of horror-movie escalation of the emasculating, fat-shaming harassment he endures from Lewis on the rapids?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d869768332bc63cb2b95840c3a47127e04e502a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d869768332bc63cb2b95840c3a47127e04e502a/0_58_2816_1689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ned Beatty, Jon Voight, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney and Burt Reynolds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ned Beatty, Jon Voight, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney and Burt Reynolds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Released in the same era as Dirty Harry and Death Wish, the film also works as an interrogation of vigilante revenge thrillers. Whatever righteous satisfaction Deliverance provokes by putting an arrow straight through Bobby’s assailant (character actor and Clint Eastwood favorite Bill McKinney) slowly dissipates in the aftermath, as our heroes relinquish any moral high ground, even as they gain a literal one. Open questions complicate everything that follows. Is Drew actually shot on the river, or is it mere shock that sends him into the water? And is the man Ed kills on the bluff the same one who held him at gunpoint, or just another backwoods other subjected to his wrath and fear? In the nightmare that closes the film, it’s guilt and uncertainty that really come floating to the surface, a bloated corpse bobbing in Ed’s subconscious.</p> <p>Fifty years after Deliverance, Hollywood has smoothed its own raging river. The jaggedness of Boorman’s movie is ancient history, a long-lost quality in studio thrillers. Yet the tensions the film exploited still snake through the culture like tributaries. Which is to say, Deliverance remains relevant to a country eternally hand-wringing about the supposed erosion of masculine ideals and forever divided down lines of geography and topography. If anything, the movie’s violent conflict looks like a premonition of the culture wars of today. And through that lens, there’s an extra sad resonance to the famous duel of stringed instruments that more or less opens the movie: a fleeting harmony between urban and rural America, doomed to give way to discordance.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/30/tim-dowling-when-it-comes-to-cricket-try-not-to-leave-the-pitch-in-an-ambulance","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T05:00:18Z","webTitle":"Tim Dowling: When it comes to cricket, try not to leave the pitch in an ambulance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/30/tim-dowling-when-it-comes-to-cricket-try-not-to-leave-the-pitch-in-an-ambulance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/30/tim-dowling-when-it-comes-to-cricket-try-not-to-leave-the-pitch-in-an-ambulance","fields":{"headline":"Tim Dowling: When it comes to cricket, try not to leave the pitch in an ambulance","trailText":"By the time the 10th wicket falls, my knees are skinned and I have bruises on both ankles","byline":"Tim Dowling","body":"<p>I am in the changing room of a cricket ground somewhere in Sussex. All around me men are pulling on tops bearing the names of university teams or some charity XI. Mine still has a Sports Direct tag that says “50% off”. I’m not sure how this came to pass. I remember a lunch party where I was asked if my sons played cricket, and I volunteered two of them for this annual fixture. Through some error, my name is also on the roster.</p> <p>When people ask me if I can play cricket I always say, “I don’t know.” I grew up in America, so I only know I can’t play baseball. It’s possible the game of cricket requires untapped skills that baseball does not. Like manners, or something.</p> <p>I once played in a cricket match about 30 years ago, back when I had not the faintest idea about it. Early on I made an easy catch – assuming it was appropriate in the circumstances – and was unprepared for the approbation that came my way. People I’d never met were clapping me on the back. Maybe I can play cricket, I thought.</p> <p>Three overs later, my nearest teammate got hit in the face by the ball and went off in an ambulance. Once he’d gone, the match resumed. That’s when I realised there was a Squid Game element to the whole business.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Fielding for the opposition is even more nerve-racking. But this would also be a bad time to get the hang of things</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back in Sussex, I am at the boundary in my new whites with the oldest one and the middle one, in the shade of a stubby tree. I notice the middle one’s friend – the son of our team captain – is wearing shorts and a dark shirt.</p> <p>“I really can’t play cricket,” he says.</p> <p>“I’m about to show you what can’t play cricket means,” I say.</p> <p>Out in the field I repeat my mantra for all team competition: don’t do anything today that becomes the only thing these people will remember about you. Don’t make a mistake of unprecedented stupidity. Don’t leave in an ambulance.</p> <p>Early on I stop a quick ball destined for the boundary by letting it bounce off my forearm, a credit against which I can weigh future errors. The oldest one bowls well. I figure that I should get credit for this too, because I drove him here.</p> <p>For the first hour, my middle son has to shout to remind me to change position between overs, but after a while I settle into a rhythm. I start to relax, but I also get competitive. I want to stop everything that comes my way, however inelegantly, with whatever part of my body can get there first. By the time the 10th wicket falls, my knees are skinned and I have bruises on both ankles. My work here, I think, is done.</p> <p>At the tea break, the oldest one and I fight over the lowest place in the batting order.</p> <p>“I really can’t bat,” he says.</p> <p>“I’ll show you what really can’t bat means,” I say. The oldest one took two wickets, so the captain rewards him with last place.</p> <p>At this point I’m still pretty certain the humiliation of batting will not arrive: the score we’re chasing is manageable, and the afternoon is wearing on. The captain comes over to me. I think: he probably wants to thank me again for that ball I stopped.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/16/tim-dowling-my-wife-has-seen-the-future-and-its-bungalow-shaped\">Tim Dowling: my wife has seen the future … and it’s bungalow shaped</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The thing is,” he says, “because we’ve got 12 men and they’ve got 11, I said we’d give them a fielder. Five overs each. You’re third.”</p> <p>Nothing in my understanding of the rules of cricket has prepared me for this news. First: our team has an extra, unnecessary player, and I am certainly him. Second: I have to go back out there in 10 overs’ time.</p> <p>Fielding for the opposition is, if anything, even more nerve-racking. Everything I do wrong looks like treachery rather than incompetence. But this would also be a bad time for me to suddenly get the hang of things. I think: this is where the manners come in.</p> <p>Amid a flurry of wickets, the system for replacing the extra fielder breaks down. I do six overs, then seven. When another wicket falls, I make my escape.</p> <p>I find the middle one putting on a helmet.</p> <p>“What are you doing?” I say.</p> <p>“I’m in next,” he says.</p> <p>“But I’m after you!” I say.</p> <p>“Yeah, you should get padded up,” he says.

In Ukraine, especially in the Kherson region, which is renowned for its carbon-rich soil and prized fruit and veg, it is typical to use the whole watermelon, with the rind often turned into a tasty preserve by cubing and soaking it in lime or vinegar, then boiling it up with sugar syrup and aromatics. My version is a fusion of these very different recipes, adding lime for acidity and ginger for depth of flavour. It’s delicious on toast, pancakes or yoghurt for breakfast, and also works well as a condiment for spiced vegetables, chicken, pork and oily fish. In most watermelon rind jam recipes, the tiger-striped green exterior is peeled off and discarded, but I enjoy the extra texture you get from the skin, which reduces waste and preparation time while adding bulk. As with most fruit, including citrus, where the exterior is not conventionally eaten, it is advisable to use organic produce to reduce exposure to pesticides.</p> <h2>Watermelon rind jam</h2> <p>If using an organic watermelon, leave the skin on; otherwise, peel and compost the green exterior.</p> <p><strong>500g watermelon rind</strong>, ideally organic<br><strong>400g sugar</strong>, ideally unrefined<br><strong>1 tbsp grated unpeeled ginger</strong></p> <p><strong>1 organic lime</strong>, finely chopped, or the juice of 3 non-organic limes</p> <p>Wash and roughly chop the watermelon rind (with or without the skin, depending on whether it’s organic or not), then pulse blend into rough shards and put in a saucepan with the sugar, ginger and lime. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then simmer for 45 minutes to an hour, until the liquid has evaporated, the mix is sticky and marmalade-like and the rind has turned translucent and become very tender.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/30/blind-date-zahra-leo","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"Blind date: ‘Did we kiss?

But her constituency party members recall a meeting when the question of her entering parliament at all hung in the balance, after she was accused of failing to disclose an extramarital affair to activists.</p> <p>It was 2009 – 12 years before she would be elevated to her current role as foreign secretary – and she was on the verge of finally becoming an MP after being selected to stand in the safe seat of South West Norfolk.</p> <p>Dozens of hardline, rural Tory activists, dubbed the “Turnip Taliban”, had called an urgent meeting, angry that an 18-month affair with the Conservative MP Mark Field had not been disclosed when she was endorsed as a candidate. Some wanted her to stand down because they believed she was being parachuted in by unwanted moderates under David Cameron’s leadership.</p> <p>Roy Brame, a self-declared member of the Turnip Taliban, had gone to the packed meeting convinced she should not stand in the safe seat at the next general election. But instead, he recalls Truss winning over a sceptical audience with a characteristic mix of charm and a thick skin.</p> <p>He voted against her that evening, but Brame said he was impressed by her responses, telling reporters after the meeting: “We have just seen the new Thatcher.”</p> <p>“People say that she’s not very good at presenting herself. But at that particular meeting, when well over 200 [people] were asking her some personal questions, and a lot about where she thought she wanted to go, she came over extremely well,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b92c9dda014a7eba0d0d4c7fa721c660f70dfd63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b92c9dda014a7eba0d0d4c7fa721c660f70dfd63/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss in a Margaret Thatcher-inspired pussybow blouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss in a Margaret Thatcher-inspired pussybow blouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Truss survived the meeting – local websites claimed that the Turnips had been mashed – and won a vote supporting her as the candidate by 132 votes to 37.</p> <p>Thirteen years later, Truss has now held six ministerial jobs under three different prime ministers – and in 2016 became the first female lord chancellor. Crucially, she appears to have currently won over a majority of the 160,000 Tory party members who will choose the next prime minister in September.</p> <p>The comparison with Thatcher is one that has been pushed hard by her team. From wearing a pussybow blouse, to driving tanks and being photographed wearing a fur hat in Moscow’s Red Square, they claim Truss is ready to shake up the Tory establishment just as her hero did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/liz-truss-cheese-karaoke-10-things-you-may-not-know\">Loves cheese, hates her first name: 10 things you may not know about Liz Truss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She was raised by Labour-supporting parents, was a Liberal Democrat, and went to what she describes as a “woke” comprehensive school in the north of England. All qualities she has been keen to promote against the Wykehamist, internationalist credentials of Sunak.</p> <p>Her critics – and she has many within her own party – say she lacks many of Thatcher’s skills. She fails to display intellectual gravitas, they say, relying instead upon cheap slogans, and struggles to make convincing speeches, another facet of her character that could be quickly exposed under the intense scrutiny of Downing Street.</p> <p>Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser, told the online magazine <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2022/05/dominic-cummings-i-dont-like-parties/\">UnHerd</a> in May that Truss was “as close to properly crackers as anybody I have met in parliament” and would be an “even worse” prime minister than Johnson.</p> <p>Others doubt if Truss really believes anything she says, and relies upon a gut instinct to fulfil her own ambitions. Anna Soubry, the former MP who served as a minister alongside Truss, said many had questioned whether she had the skills necessary to lead the UK.</p> <p>“She was the most ambitious person many people had encountered. I honestly believe she was given jobs – ministerial promotions – just to shut her up. Her ambition is, undoubtedly, considerably greater than her ability,” said Soubry.</p> <p>Mary Elizabeth Truss was born in Oxford on 26 July 1975, the eldest of four siblings and the only girl. Her left-leaning father, John Kenneth Truss, was a professor of pure mathematics at the University of Leeds. Her mother, Priscilla Mary, was a nurse, teacher and prominent member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.</p> <p>They lived in Paisley for some of Truss’s childhood, before moving to Leeds. Truss has sought to portray her former senior school, Roundhay – which sent her and many others to Oxford University – as repeatedly letting children down with “low expectations, poor educational standards and lack of opportunity”. Too much talent, she declared, “went to waste”. She even claimed it was within a “red wall” seat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88ee9dc7530ba0724bb75437dfafd3f8a22e8a9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88ee9dc7530ba0724bb75437dfafd3f8a22e8a9d/320_0_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss speaks at the 1994 Liberal Democrat conference, in which she discusses ‘abolishing the monarchy’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss speaks at the 1994 Liberal Democrat conference, in which she discusses ‘abolishing the monarchy’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her claim seems to have surprised former fellow pupils. The school is part of Leeds North East, a constituency that had voted Conservative for almost half a century until 1997. It was a rugby union-playing ex-grammar set in 22 acres of grounds in a well-to-do part of the city. Alumni include a university vice-chancellor, judges, neuroscientists, an award-winning playwright, four current or former parliamentarians and a former editor of the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate, the Tory MP for Leeds North East when Truss was a pupil at Roundhay, said he knew the school well at that time and claimed Truss’s comments appear to be “patently untrue”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/the-rebel-thrill-of-claires-accessories-is-lost-now-liz-truss-is-wearing-its-wares\">The rebel thrill of Claire’s Accessories is lost now Liz Truss is wearing its wares | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said: “I think she was suggesting she was the only person who went to any sort of university and all the others were poor, inner-city kids, which was certainly not the case for Roundhay ... Politicians in this sort of situation should be very cautious about what they say because they have a knock-on effect to the staff and former pupils.”</p> <p>Truss read PPE at Merton College, Oxford, and became a leading member of the Liberal Democrats. At the party conference at the age of 19, she called for the abolition of the monarchy. “We do not believe people are born to rule,” she said.</p> <p>Fellow former Lib Dem members said the intervention angered the late leader Paddy Ashdown, who had been assured she would remit the motion and avoid a vote. But the vote took place, drawing unwanted publicity for the party leader. “Paddy was not forgiving of those responsible for hijacking the conference,” said Lord Rennard, then a senior party figure.</p> <p>At one freshers’ week, Lib Dem members including Alan Renwick, a friend of Truss who is now an academic on constitutional affairs, were decorating a stall and Truss, then a believer in cannabis legalisation, had a particular vision of how it should look. “She wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters saying: ‘Free the Weed’, so I was scurrying around after Liz, trying to take these down again and put up a variety of different messages rather than just having this one message all over the stall,” Renwick told BBC Radio 4. She was putting them up again just as quickly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Truss was an enthusiastic participant in Oxford’s Hayek society, which celebrated the work of the Austrian political philosopher best known for his defence of classical liberalism. The same group included other Lib Dems who went on to become Tories.</p> <p>“She was incredibly difficult to work with,” recalled Neil Fawcett, now a Lib Dem councillor, who campaigned alongside her in the 90s. “On a personal level, I could never really work out what she actually believed because she always seemed to be playing to the gallery, rather than putting forward a genuine belief.”</p> <p>Truss joined the Conservatives in 1996 when the party was being torn apart by factionalism under John Major’s leadership. The following year she met her future husband, Hugh O’Leary, an accountant, at Conservative party conference, and they married in 2000.</p> <p>At 25, she made her first steps towards parliamentary politics, taking on the dispiriting task of carrying the Tory message into a northern seat in the Labour heartlands. In 2001, she contested Hemsworth, in West Yorkshire, and secured a 4% swing from Labour to Conservative, which brought the Labour majority down from nearly 24,000 to less than 16,000.</p> <p>To improve her chances of securing a more winnable seat next time, she was assigned Field, the MP for Cities of London and Westminster, as a mentor and soon after their relationship began. His marriage of 12 years ended in divorce, while hers survived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f745cf263092a90e236e6823a0c28fb4fe5dad6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f745cf263092a90e236e6823a0c28fb4fe5dad6/0_82_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss, right, and Rishi Sunak take part in the BBC Conservative party leadership debate in Stoke-on-Trent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss, right, and Rishi Sunak take part in the BBC Conservative party leadership debate in Stoke-on-Trent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After David Cameron became the Conservative leader, Truss was placed on the “A-list” of parliamentary candidates, and was tipped to be the next MP for the Tory seat of Bromley and Chislehurst, through a byelection after the death of the local MP. But after the Daily Mail broke the story of her relationship with Field, Truss was informed she would not be the candidate.</p> <p>After finally winning over the executive of the South West Norfolk Conservative party in 2009, Truss was elected to parliament the following year with a 13,140 majority. Once in parliament, she founded the Free Enterprise Group of MPs, championing deregulation and lower taxes. She co-authored Britannia Unchained, a pamphlet that described the British as “among the worst idlers in the world”.</p> <p>After a junior education role, Truss was appointed as environment secretary in 2014 for two years, during which she became a meme after a cringeworthy speech at Conservative party conference. “Britain imports two-thirds of its cheese,” she said cheerily, before quickly changing her expression to one of dark foreboding. “That. Is. A. Disgrace.”</p> <p>Her supporters insist Truss really is one of the people – she does not enjoy public speaking and prefers a closed meeting or a party. Knowing that her staccato delivery is regularly mocked, she has attempted to take the sting out of the criticism by saying she knows she is not the most polished of performers.</p> <p>During the EU referendum, she argued for remain, signing a cross-party declaration with Ed Miliband, Ed Davey and Caroline Lucas which described leave campaigners as “extreme and outdated”. After the referendum, she performed a 180-degree turn and is now one of the most vociferous supporters of leave.</p> <p>Under Theresa May, Truss was appointed justice secretary, a job that quickly ran into trouble. She initially failed to defend the judiciary after they were branded “enemies of the people” by the Daily Mail because they ruled parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit. Truss later issued a statement supporting the judges but this was seen as too little, too late.</p> <p>Her actions drew unprecedented criticism from Lord Thomas, the lord chief justice, who told MPs she had been “completely and absolutely wrong”.</p> <p>She was demoted to become chief secretary to the Treasury, but she embraced the change. In fact she became increasingly mischievous, reprimanding the then environment secretary Michael Gove publicly in one speech. “Too often we’re hearing about not drinking too much … eating too many doughnuts … or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves … I mean stoves,” she said. “I can see their point: there’s enough hot air and smoke at the environment department already.”</p> <p>Her office has gained an unwanted reputation among cabinet colleagues for leaking stories. It was often assumed that the leaks came direct from Truss, but her friends have denied this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a20bc2d77bfa3de02a95a9e9af3f101c9460b43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a20bc2d77bfa3de02a95a9e9af3f101c9460b43/0_129_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss in Moscow in February. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss in Moscow in February.

She was appointed international trade secretary and for two years signed trade deals across the world.</p> <p>As foreign secretary Truss has become increasingly active on social media, exhaustively documenting her jet-setting diplomatic trips around the world.</p> <p>Her condemnation of Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine – which saw Russian officials explicitly cite comments she made in a BBC interview as the reason for its decision to place the country’s military on high alert – has led to a rise in popularity within the Tories.</p> <p>Her solution to the impasse over the Northern Ireland protocol was to scrap large parts of that agreement. Critics said she risked a trade war with the EU and had damaged the UK’s reputation for adhering to international law.</p> <p>Her supporters say that her creative thinking also meant that she secured the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a task that had eluded three previous foreign secretaries. She enlisted Oman as an intermediary and paid a historical debt to Tehran.</p> <p>For many of the MPs who are backing Sunak, she is also the “<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/liz-truss-allies-reject-she-is-boris-johnson-continuity-candidate_uk_62cecf9ee4b0c0bdba653461\">Johnson continuity candidate</a>”. They are fuming that she appears to have won over the party.</p> <p>“If she wins, you will see pretty much the same groups of people – the same Crosby Textor [global consultants] types and the same donors. Liz is certainly very determined to get there, but the people won’t change that much and no one really knows what she might do if she gets there,” an MP said.</p> <p>Truss has been approached for comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/jul/30/sesame-place-theme-parks-black-families-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"Theme parks were not meant for Black families: why racism at Sesame Place is part of a shameful tradition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/30/sesame-place-theme-parks-black-families-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/jul/30/sesame-place-theme-parks-black-families-racism","fields":{"headline":"Theme parks were not meant for Black families: why racism at Sesame Place is part of a shameful tradition","trailText":"From old Coney Island to the Bronx Zoo, parks excluded Black people and even put them on display to amuse white people","byline":"Andrew Lawrence","body":"<p>In his sermons, Martin Luther King Jr often made reference to his daughter Yolanda Denise seeing him off to the Atlanta airport before work trips and passing an amusement center called Funtown along the way.

On Saturday, a few dozen protesters rallied for hours<strong> </strong>outside Sesame Place, which is located in the north-east Philadelphia suburb of Langhorne.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4da7d082aee6c18ebb26dd193bcba43edf595720\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da7d082aee6c18ebb26dd193bcba43edf595720/0_153_4592_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nylah Brown, whom lawyers allege was ignored by a Sesame Place actor dressed as Rosita, at a news conference in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nyla Brown, whom lawyers allege was ignored by a Sesame Place actor dressed as Rosita, at a news conference in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the federal lawsuit, which seeks to become a class action, Quinton Burns of Maryland alleges that when he and his five-year-old daughter attended a Sesame Place meet-and-greet on Fathers’ Day, they were purposely ignored by four costumed performers playing Ernie, Elmo, Telly and Abby. On Wednesday, Burns <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/family-suing-sesame-place-releases-video-of-incident-1849343595\">released</a> his own 29-second video of the characters passing over his daughter for a high five to interact with white children. “Just looking at her face, it makes me want to cry every time I see it,” Burns said at a courthouse news conference.</p> <p>Sesame Workshop, which created the park’s characters and owns the licensing rights but does not own the park, has been quick to condemn the incidents and urged park executives to act swiftly.</p> <p>It almost beggars belief that Sesame Street could be associated with a racial discrimination lawsuit. The children’s TV series was conceived amid the social justice movement of the 1960s as edutainment for -children from disadvantaged backgrounds and an inclusionary showcase for Black and Hispanic actors. The state of Mississippi banished the show from its airwaves in 1970 for having too diverse a cast. The character Rosita, who has been around since 1991, hails from Mexico and was Sesame Street’s first<strong> </strong>regularly appearing bilingual muppet, toggling between Spanish and English.</p> <p>But the history of a radical and diverse TV show clashes with the story of amusement parks in America. The 1875 Civil Rights Act included a line mandating equal access to public accommodations, but the supreme court wound up undermining the latitude to enforce that law.</p> <p>This meant that at the 1904 World’s Fair, which was held in St Louis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/13/st-louis-olympics-1904-tokyo-flawed-games\">in conjunction with a disastrous summer Olympics</a>, put Black and brown bodies on display. A group of African pygmies branded savages were showcased in a hollow that had a walkway over the top so white visitors could point down and laugh. A year later one of the men in the exhibition, Otis Benga, was relegated to <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/arts/the-forgotten-history-of-racism-at-the-1904-worlds-fair-in-st-louis-18277369\">a Bronx Zoo display cage</a>.</p> <p>Amusement parks as we know them today, says Victoria Wolcott, a University of Buffalo history professor whose 2012 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Race-Riots-Roller-Coasters-Segregated/dp/0812223284\">Race, Riots, and Roller Coasters</a> takes in the dark arc of public leisure space in the US, “emerged at the nadir of race relations”, as the country was segueing out of reconstruction into segregation. The parks were often marketed with dog whistles like “clean” or “safe”, and they stationed sentinels at their gates to enforce the whites-only policy. If a Black family did happen on to the grounds in these early days, they could expect to be beaten bloody for their mistake.</p> <p>At Coney Island, park operators<strong> </strong>made games out of brutality. The park, like many in the US in the early 20th century, had an attraction called the African Dodger, in which white ticket holders would attempt to hit baseballs at the heads of actual Black people – a number of whom suffered broken noses, teeth and other serious injuries.</p> <p>“This was not that long ago,” says Dewey Clayton, a University of Louisville political science professor who vividly remembers not being able to set foot inside the white section of a Myrtle Beach amusement park the same July day President Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Right Act into law. “It was in my lifetime. Too many of my colleagues here at the university and in the area have had just really sad experiences like that as children.”</p> <p>The exception among amusement parks was Disneyland, which didn’t discriminate among would-be customers as long as they could fork up the money for an entrance fee, which few other parks charged at that time. But while Black families were allowed at Disneyland, the cover charge and lack of public transportation to access the park meant it was out of reach for many.</p> <p>The Congress of Racial Equality, which bolstered King’s non-violent activism, was formed largely in response to discrimination at theme parks and other recreational spaces. “One of the things that was really so sad was reading memoirs of African American activists who talked about that exclusion when they were children as being absolutely searing,” Wolcott says.</p> <p>In 2013, a Black family from San Diego sued Disney for discrimination after their children were snubbed by an employee in costume as White Rabbit, the time-obsessed character from Alice in Wonderland. The case, actually titled Black v White, was quickly settled for an undisclosed sum. It could serve as precedent in what could be a landmark class-action suit against Sesame Place.</p> <p>In a series of statements last week, Sesame Place issued “heartbroken” apologies to the affected families and vowed to institute mandatory bias training for employees. It has thus far declined to say if any employees had been disciplined.</p> <p>Win or lose, Burns, the father who brought this legal action, hopes to send a clear message: “This is unacceptable,” he said at his news conference, “and we will not stand by and let this continue.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/jul/30/crisps-veg-and-sardines-in-a-foreign-supermarket-edith-pritchett-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Crisps, veg and sardines in a foreign supermarket – Edith Pritchett cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/jul/30/crisps-veg-and-sardines-in-a-foreign-supermarket-edith-pritchett-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/jul/30/crisps-veg-and-sardines-in-a-foreign-supermarket-edith-pritchett-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Crisps, veg and sardines in a foreign supermarket – Edith Pritchett cartoon","trailText":"Sardine city …","byline":"Edith Pritchett","body":"<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/03/comics-master-2016/embed/embed.html?srcs-mobile=https://media.guim.co.uk/26c523bcff68980ffe3b5dd41b02d818da23d058/0_0_1107_1204/460.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/b7e71fedac28547d85d823e9f10c55498913e1b4/0_0_1109_1203/461.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/b5e892ce854b15edcda7ac4e5f8f828d780c35f5/0_0_1108_1204/460.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/7b89e5a6afaba6a3043655f4e99d43722b6d09d3/0_0_1107_1203/460.jpg&amp;ratios-mobile=108.69565217391303+108.45986984815619+108.69565217391303+108.69565217391303&amp;srcs-desktop=https://media.guim.co.uk/035823866ea92ad60db8ff550ae2173fc65c4d1d/0_0_4476_1205/2000.jpg&amp;ratios-desktop=27.142857142857142&amp;credit=Comic%20by%20Edith%20Pritchett/The%20Guardian&amp;background=FFFFFF&amp;vpadding=20\" data-alt=\"An authentic experience in a foreign supermarket – Edith Pritchett cartoon\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/03/comics-master-2016/embed/embed.html?srcs-mobile=https://media.guim.co.uk/26c523bcff68980ffe3b5dd41b02d818da23d058/0_0_1107_1204/460.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/b7e71fedac28547d85d823e9f10c55498913e1b4/0_0_1109_1203/461.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/b5e892ce854b15edcda7ac4e5f8f828d780c35f5/0_0_1108_1204/460.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/7b89e5a6afaba6a3043655f4e99d43722b6d09d3/0_0_1107_1203/460.jpg&ratios-mobile=108.69565217391303+108.45986984815619+108.69565217391303+108.69565217391303&srcs-desktop=https://media.guim.co.uk/035823866ea92ad60db8ff550ae2173fc65c4d1d/0_0_4476_1205/2000.jpg&ratios-desktop=27.142857142857142&credit=Comic%20by%20Edith%20Pritchett/The%20Guardian&background=FFFFFF&vpadding=20\">An authentic experience in a foreign supermarket – Edith Pritchett cartoon</a> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/30/people-are-turning-off-muscovites-put-the-war-aside-and-enjoy-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"‘People are turning off’: Muscovites put the war aside and enjoy summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/people-are-turning-off-muscovites-put-the-war-aside-and-enjoy-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/30/people-are-turning-off-muscovites-put-the-war-aside-and-enjoy-summer","fields":{"headline":"‘People are turning off’: Muscovites put the war aside and enjoy summer","trailText":"Many of Moscow’s citizens are taking a break from their worries and the backlash that discussing the war on Ukraine can bring","byline":"Andrew Roth in Moscow","body":"<p>As Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds into its fifth month, Moscow is a city doing everything it can to turn a blind eye to the conflict. It is a champagne-soaked summer like any other in the Russian capital, despite the thousands of dead and many more wounded in a war increasingly marked by acts of savage brutality.</p> <p>In Gorky Park, outdoor festivals, cinemas and bars were all jammed on a recent evening, with young couples twirling to ballroom dance music as others stopped for selfies along the Moscow river nearby.</p> <p>“Yes, we are having a party,” said Anna Mitrokhina, one of the dancers at an outdoor dance platform on the Moscow river, wearing a blue-sequin dress and heavy eye-makeup. “We are outside of politics, we want to dance, to feel and have fun. I can’t worry any more and this helps me forget.”</p> <p>Walk through the city or switch on a VPN to scroll through Instagram or Facebook and you might not even know the country’s at war, a word that the Russian censors have banned from local media and that, even among many friends, has become taboo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"952e98597121902500d06339336ed0cd9621ebdb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/952e98597121902500d06339336ed0cd9621ebdb/0_0_5469_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People on the street as daily life continues in Moscow, Russia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People on the street as daily life continues in Moscow, Russia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lifestyle Instagram blogger with more than 100,000 followers who was opposed to the war said that she had consciously decided to stop speaking about the topic – because of the official restrictions but also the backlash she received from subscribers.</p> <p>“Nobody wants to hear about the war, the special military operation, any more, they tell me to stop talking about this and get back to normal topics like beauty and fitness,” she said, asking that her name not be used. “Every time I mentioned it I would get so much hate in my messages. It hurts me, it hurts my business. I stopped mentioning it. It just doesn’t exist for many people.”</p> <p>“What hurts the most is it is not really [because of the law], there is just no desire to talk about this,” she said. “People are turning off.”</p> <p>In a forthcoming paper shared with the Guardian titled “How public opinion is hiding from the truth”, Russian-based political analyst Andrei Kolesnikov and Levada Centre pollster Denis Volkov write that the war has become “routine” for many Russians.</p> <p>“The inability to influence what is happening makes people think less about global political issues and focus more on everyday subjects, on life here and now,” the authors write.</p> <p>If Russians were shocked by the outbreak of war in March, they said, then by June far fewer listed it as the most significant issue for the country right now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2eba880e5dfd3133b8ab3a53226fdf63eec8140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2eba880e5dfd3133b8ab3a53226fdf63eec8140/0_0_5000_3332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children cool themselves in the water of the Neglinnaya river enjoying the end of a hot day near the Kremlin Wall, in Moscow, Russia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children cool themselves in the water of the Neglinnaya river enjoying the end of a hot day near the Kremlin Wall, in Moscow, Russia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And many have found it easier to join the “mainstream” of support or indifference to the war, they added, calling it the “most comfortable” position, and one that doesn’t force people to “observe or, most importantly, think”.</p> <p>After a wave of repressions, there are fewer voices now speaking out publicly against the war. But some remain.</p> <p>At a table by the window in Moscow’s Pushkin cafe, Alexey Venediktov is loudly decrying the conflict as “catastrophic” as the waitstaff look on with an air of concern. The former head of Echo of Moscow, the Russian radio station that was shut down after its public opposition to the war, has now been declared a foreign agent. “I was an enemy, now I am a traitor,” he says of his relationship with Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Venediktov had played a careful game for years, both protecting his radio station’s independence while maintaining good relations with senior Kremlin officials. That all ended after Russia’s invasion in late February.</p> <p>“I told my staff that the closure of Echo was the price of our freedom,” he said. “And your unemployment is also the price … you wanted freedom, I provided it. I was your <em>krysha </em>(protection). Now we pay the price.”</p> <p>He was also friends with people such as Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT television station and one of the top cheerleaders for the war on television. “I showed her photos of the dead children in Mariupol,” he said. “I could see her eyes get glassy. And then I heard what I hear from the television: ‘They did it to themselves. It’s staged. It’s Nazis …’ So we don’t speak any more. I just don’t understand how as a mother she can allow for this. And it’s like that in every family.”</p> <p>Those tensions are playing out in families across the country, particularly in big cities where younger generations are often liberal. At a small church attached to a monastery in north-west Moscow, father Alexei says that for months he has had parents breaking down to him because of family tensions due to the conflict, many asking for advice on how to quell family disputes or change their relatives’ opinions about the war.</p> <p>“I can’t tell you how many people have come to talk to me … dozens, maybe hundreds,” he said, saying that in particular he’s had a steady stream of pensioners since February. “People are under immense stress. Families are being ripped apart.”</p> <p>As those tensions often play out in private, Moscow is busy keeping up appearances, desperate to show that it is resisting sanctions and isolation as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/mcdonalds-bows-to-pressure-and-closes-all-its-russian-restaurants\">western brands have fled the capital</a>.</p> <p>The country’s first McDonald’s on Tverskaya Street has now been renamed as Tasty and That’s It, a facsimile of the American fast food brand that also serves to keep Russians at work. “Some things change but stable employment remains,” a banner screams out. It reads like a rallying cry for Russia, which is keen to decry sanctions while ignoring the conflict that provoked them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6233550ebed43713cebd2bb73365e696b7eb61d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6233550ebed43713cebd2bb73365e696b7eb61d1/0_0_4119_2696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker removing McDonald’s logotype from a Moscow restaurant in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker removing McDonald’s logotype from a Moscow restaurant in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I think our guys are top-notch,” said Dmitry, who had bought a double cheeseburger and a large fries with several sauce packets still bearing the McDonald’s logo. “We can make all the same things, the same food, the same design, without the western owners. I hope that they’re all thrown out.”</p> <p>But many people, especially those in business circles, recognise the hit the economy has taken and that the worst may be yet to come. “My parents grew up in a country where there was no foreign competition and we know how that was,” said Alexander Perepelkin, the editor of the Blueprint, a fashion and culture publication, and a marketing director who regularly worked with foreign brands. “It wasn’t good.”</p> <p>When his publication launched a new pop-up shop catering to local brands at the Aviapark shopping mall – one of Europe’s largest – this week, it was a subdued event. “We don’t think that right now is the time to have a big party,” he said.</p> <p>But for others, it’s exactly the time to let loose. “I’ve stopped talking about politics and the special operation after March,” says Marina Belova, who was eating at a paella restaurant along the Moscow river on Wednesday evening. “I fought with my parents and realised I could lose them and never change their minds anyway, it was extremely bitter and mean. I keep my friends close, I try to relax, not to think about the future. I hope that I can travel again soon. But I don’t know what others will think of me, or what I will do if I meet someone from Ukraine abroad.”</p> <p>Others seemed more motivated by rejecting what they claim is western propaganda – in particular, accusations of atrocities – saying how the war is run is out of their hands.</p> <p>“We have nothing to feel bad for,” said Vadim Presnyakov, who was inline skating in the park. “We are being told to feel guilty but there is nothing that any of us could have done about what’s taking place. And the more that you tell people to feel guilty, they more they will just reject you.”</p> <p>The alternative is stark: events have panned out poorly for those who have even offered slight criticism of the war. Alexei Gorinov, a Moscow city council member who spoke out against the war, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/08/moscow-councillor-jailed-seven-years-criticising-ukraine-war-alexei-gorinov\">sentenced to seven years in prison</a> earlier this month for “discrediting the Russian army.”</p> <p>“What kind of children’s drawing contest can we talk about for Children’s Day … when we have children dying every day?” he had said, the key piece of evidence against him in the trial.</p> <p>“The saddest thing is that I won’t see my dog,” he told Russian rights defender Eva Merkacheva when she visited him in prison this week. “She won’t be alive by the time I am freed.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/30/tv-tonight-rupaul-drag-race-down-under-bbc-three","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: the fabulous queens slaying Drag Race Down Under ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/30/tv-tonight-rupaul-drag-race-down-under-bbc-three","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/30/tv-tonight-rupaul-drag-race-down-under-bbc-three","fields":{"headline":"TV tonight: the fabulous queens slaying Drag Race Down Under ","trailText":"RuPaul and Michelle Visage are back with a colourful cohort of hopefuls.

It is being fashioned from the Medway secure training centre, a youth detention centre that was shut down in March 2020 after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/revealed-g4s-youth-jail-faced-abuse-claims-12-years-ago\">series of abuse scandals</a>.</p> <p>The secure school was originally due to open in autumn 2020 but now hopes to accept its first students in early 2024 after costs spiralled from £4.9m to £36.5m. The <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Children-in-custody-secure-training-centres-and-secure-schools.pdf\">National Audit Office</a> said the estimate jumped “due mainly to significant design revisions after due diligence”.</p> <p>The school will be run by a “principal director”, <a href=\"https://www.oasisrestore.org/about-us/meet-the-staff\">Andrew Willetts</a>, rather than a prison governor, and children will be cared for by teachers, not guards, said Chalke, who oversees 52 Oasis academies in England. “We don’t have young offenders. We have students. Just like we have bedrooms, and we are home. There’s none of that alienating language left,” he said.</p> <p>Instead of living in wings, the children will be grouped into four “houses”, and they will be able to relax in living rooms “with sofas and a coffee table you can put your feet on”. Chalke said he was determined that the children’s bedrooms would not have bars on them and instead would be reinforced with toughened glass.</p> <p>Everything about the school’s design, from the colours to the furniture and garden, is intended to “de-stress” children who are “overcoming trauma and grief and violence and loss and neglect”, Chalke said. An expert in “therapeutic colours” has been working as a consultant on the project to advise which paint will help keep the children calm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/28/number-children-in-custody-england-wales-national-audit-office-report\">Number of children in custody in England and Wales set to double by 2024</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When children misbehave or commit crime they are “communicating some of the anxiety and the chaos in their lives”, Chalke said. “My wife tells me the more anxious I am, the more stressed I am, the more stupidly I behave. We all behave and do stupid things when we’re stressed and anxious. We want to care for these young people and that’s why we called it Oasis Restore, because it’s about restoration.”</p> <p>As well as studying a full curriculum including England and maths, students will be able to record songs at an on-site music studio set up by Judah Armani, who founded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/21/stars-behind-bars-inhouse-records-prisons-music-recording\">InHouse Records</a>, a pioneering record label run by and for prisoners. Those who have taken part in the music programme in traditional jails, including <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/isis-prison\">Isis prison</a>, a young offender institution, have a reoffending rate of under 1%.</p> <p>“The studio will be teaching young people life skills, and capturing their imagination. It will give them journeys into good employment, beyond our walls, at the same time as working with them therapeutically,” Chalke said.</p> <p>In December 2016 the MoJ set out its intention to create two new secure schools in England, one in the north-west and one in the south-east. No plans for the northern school have been released.</p> <p>“Youth justice needs to be reformed. It needs a revolution,” said Chalke. Just under <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8557/CBP-8557.pdf\">two-thirds (64%) of children</a> and young people released from custody reoffend within 12 months of release, and each of them commit an average of four new offences. As of February 2022 there were 414 young people in youth custody – in secure children’s homes, young offender institutions and secure training centres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"-\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A maximum of 49 children – girls and boys aged 12 to 18 –&nbsp;will live at Restore, either after being sentenced or while on remand awaiting trial. The MoJ’s placement board will decide which children to send to the school, and Chalke said Oasis did not have a veto on who to accept. </p> <p>The school, which will work with NHS England, is soon to begin recruiting 180 staff. Unlike much of the rest of the prison system, no service will be outsourced.</p> <p>“Everyone has to be passionate about young people. Our theme is relentless love,” Chalke said. “You know, I’ve been questioned about that. And people say ‘oh, you can’t just do lovey-dovey, you know’, or ‘that sounds hippy’ or whatever. But relentless love has boundaries, it has respect.”</p> <p>He said he had wanted Restore’s strapline to be “setting children free” but he was vetoed. Instead its motto will be “creating a secure future for young people”. But Chalke said his original idea was important. “If we don’t set them free, it’s a waste of public money.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/jul/30/boris-and-carrie-johnson-find-their-dream-home-stephen-collins-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life

them","byline":"Josh Halliday North of England correspondent","body":"<p>Greater Manchester police has been accused of using “deeply racist” tactics after it banned dozens of people from a Caribbean carnival because it suspected them of links to “a street gang”.</p> <p>The force came under fire after issuing letters to a number of people explaining that they would be refused entry to the celebration because they had been identified as “either a member of a street gang, affiliated to a street gang” or “perceived by others to be associated to a street gang”.</p> <p>A chief superintendent said the banning order was in place “as per the wishes of the organisers and the community”.</p> <p>However, the approach provoked outrage from youth justice campaigners who said it was an example of “police racism” that “disproportionately target[ed] people of colour, and particularly Black boys and men”.</p> <p>Dr Remi Joseph-Salisbury, a member of the Northern Police Monitoring Project, said: “These letters are really troubling for a range of reasons – perhaps most fundamentally because they exclude young people from attending a cultural celebration based on the racist construct of the gang.</p> <p>“That construct is already highly questionable, to say the least, but is used in particularly broad and intangible ways in this letter.”</p> <p>Northern Police Monitoring Project said a “gang” was a “deeply racist construct” that labels young people – disproportionately black boys – due to their friendships, interests or cultures.</p> <p>Joseph-Salisbury said: “In a context where young Black men are often stereotyped as gang members and drug dealers, to deny entry because someone may, for example, be ‘perceived by others to be associated to a street gang’, is despicable and deeply harmful.”</p> <p>The warnings came ahead of the Caribbean Carnival of Manchester, an annual celebration of Caribbean culture in Alexandra Park in the Moss Side area of the city, on 13 and 14 August.</p> <p>Campaigners believe the letters were issued to about 50 people, predominantly young men of colour, although this has not been confirmed by Greater Manchester police (GMP).</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoxyLegane/status/1551977244188413954/photo/1\">the letter</a>, an unnamed chief superintendent writes: “This letter has been issued to YOU, based on an individual basis, as it is believed that YOU are either: a member of a street gang; affiliated to a street gang; perceived by others to be associated to a street gang; involved in criminal activity; arrested at [Caribbean Carnival of Manchester in] 2019/2020/2021; involved or linked to serious youth violence.”</p> <p>It adds: “You will not be permitted entry to the carnival as per the wishes of the organisers and the community.”</p> <p>Roxy Legane, of the Kids of Colour group, said she was “furious” about GMP’s approach. She said it encouraged “racism that will be played out at that [carnival] entrance as people guess at ‘gangs’”.</p> <p>Joseph-Salisbury, a presidential fellow in ethnicity and inequalities at the University of Manchester, said “serious questions” needed to be asked of the carnival organisers who, he said, appeared to be acting as “community legitimisers for the enactment of police racism”.</p> <p>He said Caribbean carnivals had a rich history in Britain and across the world and that part of their identity was about “resistance to racism, and specifically police racism”.</p> <p>He added: “These letters, and the increasing involvement of police in carnivals as sponsors, undermine and erode that history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We know that events like carnival – that are expressive of Black culture and attract significant numbers of Black people – are stigmatised and policed in ways that we simply don’t see for comparably sized (and larger) events where the majority of attenders are white. These letters are the latest example of this.”</p> <p>Chief Supt Rob Cousen, commander of GMP’s City of Manchester district, said: “Caribbean Carnival is a long-established and well-attended celebration. Every year, Greater Manchester police works with partner agencies, including organisers, and members of the public to keep people as safe as possible. Sadly, in years gone by, there have been a number of incidents of serious violence which have posed a high risk of harm to those in attendance.</p> <p>“Caribbean Carnival is a licensed event and is therefore subject to conditions of entry, agreed by all relevant parties, to prevent and reduce crime; harm; and anti-social behaviour. Since 2006, letters which outline these conditions have been sent to individuals about whom we have intelligence to suggest they may threaten the safety of the event. The recipients are wide ranging in terms of age, gender and ethnic background and are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>“It is worth noting that this strategy is supported by both Manchester city council, as the licensing authority, and the locality’s independent advisory group. The group is made up of members of the public representing our diverse communities, who regularly feedback to GMP to ensure the force provides an outstanding service whilst serving its fundamental purposes.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/30/country-diary-its-never-too-late-to-start-a-new-tradition","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T04:30:15Z","webTitle":"Country diary: It’s never too late to start a new tradition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/30/country-diary-its-never-too-late-to-start-a-new-tradition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/30/country-diary-its-never-too-late-to-start-a-new-tradition","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: It’s never too late to start a new tradition","trailText":"<strong>Ashbrittle, Somerset:</strong> Gathering here to dress the old well started in lockdown as a way to connect to each other and the local landscape.

The Mediterranean Sea is experiencing a major marine heatwave, with sea surface temperatures in western parts of the Mediterranean 4-5C warmer than average. Temperatures have been above average for prolonged periods since the start of May, with June the warmest on record for large portions of the Mediterranean basin. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has classified the current event as a “severe” category 3 event, one level from extreme thresholds.</p> <p>Marine heatwaves can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future due to human-induced climate change. Scientists have found that marine heatwaves between 2015 and 2019 in the Mediterranean caused mass casualties in marine species, coral bleaching and harmful algal blooms.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a winter heatwave has been affecting parts of South America. Paraguay observed its hottest July day on record with 39.1C recorded at Vallemi airport on 25 July. The previous national July record was 38.5C.

Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the UN security council the US was seeing growing signs that Russia is laying the groundwork to attempt to annex the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, including by installing “illegitimate proxy officials in Russian-held areas, with the goal of holding sham referenda or decree to join Russia.</p></li> </ul> <p>Footage broadcast on Russian television on Friday said to be from the scene at the prison in Olenivka showed military personnel examining a building with a hole in the roof, tangled metal from bunk beds and blood trails among personal effects.

The intercepted conversations indicated the Russians may have placed explosives in the prison, the agency said in a statement. “In particular, none of the eyewitnesses heard any missile flying towards the correctional facility. There was no characteristic whistling, and the explosions occurred on their own.”</p> <p>In addition, online video footage showed that the windows remained whole in some rooms of the facility, according to the SBU. That “indicates that the epicentre of the explosion was inside the destroyed building, and its walls took the hit from the blast waves, protecting some of the neighbouring rooms.”</p> <p>The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for a “strict investigation” into the attack and urged the UN and other international organisations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barrack just a few days before the strike, suggesting it was planned. The Russian allegations, he said, were “a classic, cynical and elaborate false flag operation” designed to discredit Ukrainian authorities.</p> <p>The Azov regiment and other Ukrainian units defended the Azovstal steel mill for nearly three months, clinging to its underground maze of tunnels.

That’s a growing challenge for officials during disasters, because models used to predict storm impacts are in part based on past events and can’t keep up with increasingly devastating flash floods and heatwaves like those that have recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/26/pacific-north-west-heatwave-portland-oregon\">hit the Pacific north-west</a> and southern Plains.</p> \n<p>“It’s a battle of extremes going on right now in the United States,” said the University of Oklahoma meteorologist Jason Furtado. “These are things we expect to happen because of climate change ... A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor and that means you can produce increased heavy rainfall.”</p> \n<p>The deluge came two days after record rains around St Louis dropped more than 12in and killed at least two people. Last month, heavy rain on mountain snow in Yellowstone national park triggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/19/yellowstone-reopen-partially-wednesday\">historic flooding</a> and the evacuation of more than 10,000 people. In both instances, the rain flooding far exceeded what forecasters predicted.</p> \n<p>The floodwaters raging through Appalachia were so swift that some people trapped in their homes couldn’t be immediately reached, said the Floyd county, Kentucky, judge-executive, Robbie Williams.</p> \n<p>Just to the west in hard-hit Perry County, authorities said some people remained unaccounted for and almost everyone in the area had suffered some sort of damage.</p> \n<p>“We’ve still got a lot of searching to do,” said Jerry Stacy, the emergency management director in Perry County.</p> \n<p>More than 330 people have sought shelter, Beshear said. And with property damage so extensive, the governor opened an online portal for donations to the victims.</p> \n<p>Beshear predicted that would take more than a year to fully rebuild.</p> \n<p>The governor got a look at the flooding Friday aboard a helicopter.</p> \n<p>“Hundreds of homes, the ballfields, the parks, businesses under more water than I think any of us have ever seen in that area,” the governor said. “Absolutely impassable in numerous spots. Just devastating.”</p> \n<p>Portions of at least 28 state roads in Kentucky were blocked due to flooding or mudslides, Beshear said.

It would pose serious implications for the live cattle trade and limit the export of dairy products, genetic materials, hides and some meat products.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/27/foot-and-mouth-disease-how-is-indonesia-trying-to-control-the-outbreak\">Foot-and-mouth disease: how is Indonesia trying to control the outbreak?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is mostly spread by biting insects or close contact with infected animals. LSD is not harmful to humans but can infect cattle and buffalo, causing a range of animal welfare issues and production losses.</p> <p>Worryingly, LSD could<strong> </strong>enter the country in infected insects blown into Australia by a tropical storm. That makes it a very difficult disease to control.</p> <h2>African swine fever</h2> <p>Since 2016 the presence of African swine fever (ASF) has increased across several countries in Africa, Europe and Asia. Most of the animals reported lost to the virus have been in Asia, which accounts for 82% of reported global pig losses. ASF has made its way to Australia’s doorstep, with the virus reported in Timor-Leste in September 2019 and Papua New Guinea in March 2020.</p> <p>ASF is a deadly virus that is spread through the transport of infected materials or infected pigs. ASF can persist in pork products for many years, making detection at Australian borders of undeclared animal products a key line of defence. In the two years to November 2020, <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/animal/asf#:~:text=ASF%20has%20never%20occurred%20in,our%20trade%20and%20the%20economy.\">border officials intercepted 43 tonnes of pork products</a> in mainland capital city airports excluding Darwin.</p> <p>Although Australia doesn’t have a significant export market for locally produced pork products, the entry of the virus into the local pig population would be disastrous given the 90%-plus mortality rate in infected pig populations.</p> <h2>Varroa mite</h2> <p>Australia is currently dealing with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/27/what-is-the-varroa-mite-and-does-it-pose-a-threat-the-deadly-parasite-that-sent-nsw-into-bee-lockdown\">serious outbreak of varroa destructor mite</a> after years of vigilance trying to keep it out.

In hot weather beetle populations increase quickly, which can cause significant losses to stored produce, such as grain in silos. Infested stores can be contaminated with cast skins and hairs from beetle larvae, which can also pose a health risk.</p> <p>If the khapra beetle enters Australia, many of our trading partners would reject stored grain, rice and oilseed produced here. Given that Australia exports a high proportion of the crops we grow, this beetle could cause huge losses to the broadacre cropping sector.</p> <h2>Brown marmorated stink bug</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/plant/brown-marmorated-stink-bug\">brown marmorated stink bug</a> hides within all manner of imported goods and personal effects, being known to hitchhike in travellers’ suitcases.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/07/more-than-15m-bees-destroyed-in-nsw-to-contain-deadly-varroa-mite-parasite\">More than 15m bees destroyed in NSW to contain deadly varroa mite parasite</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It can breed huge populations, which pose a significant risk to many producers because it feeds on more than 300 different host plants, including fruit trees and woody ornamentals like apples, citrus, figs and beans. If it is established in Australia, this pest would be extremely difficult to eradicate, as pesticide has limited effect.</p> <h2>Xylella</h2> <p>This plant disease has no cure.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/plant/xylella\">xylella bacterium</a> kills the plant by limiting its ability to feed. It would affect grapes, almonds, avocados and multiple species of fruit trees. It would most likely come in via infected plant material and would be spread locally by insects.</p> <h2>Karnal bunt</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/plant/karnal-bunt\">Karnal bunt</a> is caused by a fungus that infects grains at the flowering stage. The fungus produces a huge quantity of powdery spores that discolour grain and infection is often signalled by a fishy smell.</p> <p>If karnal bunt got into Australia, it would have a major economic impact on the grain sector, with over 45 trading partners likely to reject exports. Karnal bunt would be almost impossible to eradicate because the spores released by the fungus can persist in the environment for up to four years and can be carried significant distances by wind.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/30/history-of-violence-how-a-murder-suicide-ended-a-bloody-chapter-in-a-small-victorian-town","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T02:00:12Z","webTitle":"History of violence: how a murder-suicide ended a bloody chapter in a small Victorian town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/30/history-of-violence-how-a-murder-suicide-ended-a-bloody-chapter-in-a-small-victorian-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/30/history-of-violence-how-a-murder-suicide-ended-a-bloody-chapter-in-a-small-victorian-town","fields":{"headline":"History of violence: how a murder-suicide ended a bloody chapter in a small Victorian town","trailText":"Kevin Knowles was shot and killed on a country road near Kirkstall on 22 July, but no one who knew him was surprised he had met such an end","byline":"Nino Bucci","body":"<p>Death was never far behind Kevin Knowles. It was there when he and his partner, Amanda Bourke, spent the day drinking with Stephen Johnston in 2016. Johnston was savagely beaten at his home in Victoria’s south-west and left with 101 separate injuries; he died in hospital. Knowles was the main suspect.</p> <p>Death was close again when Bourke drowned while swimming with Knowles at a rugged and isolated beach two years later. With her died almost any chance of Knowles being prosecuted for Johnston’s death.<br><br>But death caught up with Knowles on 22 July, when he was shot and run over on a single-lane country road near Kirkstall, north-west of Warrnambool. The suspected gunman, who is also thought to have killed another man found dead with Knowles, drove home and turned the gun on himself.</p> <p>While local residents expressed shock at the carnage that unfolded in such a peaceful part of the state, no one with even a passing knowledge of Knowles was surprised he’d met such an end. </p> <p>Johnston described Knowles in his diary as “the devil”. Despite these reservations, Johnston spent the final hours of his life drinking with Knowles and Bourke on 7 December 2016.</p> <p>In 2020, a coroner, Simon McGregor, found that Knowles and Johnston had argued about Bourke and that Knowles caused Johnston’s injuries by assaulting him while affected by drugs.<em> </em></p> <p>Bourke was routinely brutalised by Knowles, McGregor found. Johnston had even written in his diary that he had twice driven Bourke to the police station so she could report Knowles for assaulting her. <br><br>Knowles would later be jailed for giving Bourke a black eye, threatening to kill her with a knife and bury her, and grabbing her around the throat while covering her mouth to try to stop her from breathing.</p> <p>Handwritten letters sent by the couple while Knowles was in prison were revealed during the inquest.</p> <p>The letters showed Knowles repeatedly urged Bourke not to be a “dog” by speaking to the “jacks” about his involvement in Johnston’s death. </p> <p>McGregor noted at the inquest that though the case against Knowles was circumstantial, and Knowles had a right to not give evidence during the proceedings to avoid incriminating himself, he would be referring the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider charges against Knowles.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The inquest also uncovered another letter that Bourke had written to her mother. She told her Knowles had “got real nasty many times” towards her and that she had made a complaint to police.<br><br>Officers had wanted her in “witness protection”, she wrote, as they feared Knowles would kill her, but she refused as she would not be able to see her daughter.</p> <p>Within months, Bourke, 44, died on a lonely stretch of beach. And Knowles was by her side.</p> <p>The Cutting is a wild stretch of coast almost directly halfway between Warrnambool and Port Fairy that is rarely frequented by swimmers.</p> <p>According to coronial findings, on 18 January 2018, with the temperature climbing towards 40 degrees, Knowles and Bourke decided to go swimming. Knowles said Bourke suggested the Cutting rather than other beaches so that the pair wouldn’t bump into people they did not want to see.</p> <p>They went into the water in the late afternoon, and Knowles said Bourke jumped on his back. A witness at the time who was walking on the beach with his wife said he had seen a couple cuddling in the water and they “seemed to be all right”.</p> <p>But Knowles said that he soon lost his footing, and then realised he could no longer touch the seafloor. He went under the water, and Bourke slipped from his back.</p> <p>He said she called for him to help, he grabbed her, but the motion of the waves broke his grip and he momentarily lost sight of her.</p> <p>When he saw her again, she was 20 metres away and appeared to be floating.</p> <p>Knowles then yelled for help. The same witness who had seen the couple earlier came to his aid, crossing a large channel that contained a dangerous rip, before locating Bourke. She could not be revived.</p> <p>Bourke and Knowles were engaged, and lived together in Kirkstall. But her family were so concerned about his history of violence towards her, and the fact that she was the only witness to Johnston’s death, that they urged a coroner to hold an inquest into Bourke’s death.</p> <p>They later withdrew the request, and a coroner, Caitlin English, made findings into the death – without holding an inquest – that cleared Knowles of any involvement despite there being a number of “unusual aspects” to the drowning on “first examination”.</p> <p>She was satisfied Knowles had been violent to Bourke, and that as the only witness to Johnston’s assault she could implicate Knowles in the death, but found no evidence the drowning was anything other than an accident “caused by treacherous sea conditions”.</p> <p>Despite being linked to two suspicious deaths in as many years, Knowles kept on much as he had before. At the time of the Johnston inquest he had a more than 50-page criminal record, and had been due to face court again three days after he died.</p> <p>But at some point on 22 July, it appears he had an altercation with another Kirkstall man, Travis Cashmore.</p> <p>Knowles, 49, would walk more than an hour from Kirkstall to the larger town of Koroit most days, often with his mate Benjamin Ray, local residents told Guardian Australia. <br><br>Cashmore found them on the road between the towns that morning, and ended their lives. It may never be clear why, but police are preparing a report for the coroner.</p> <p>At some point in the days after the deaths, a sign was screwed on to Cashmore’s gate.</p> <p>“Free,” it read in large black block letters, “Trav!

Rajapaksa, relaxed in his chinos and polo shirt as he strolled through the car park of the popular American supermarket Trader Joe’s, looked surprised when a woman sidled up and shoved a brown envelope into his hands. “You’ve been served,” <a href=\"https://revealnews.org/podcast/my-neighbor-the-suspected-war-criminal/\">said the private investigator</a> before rushing away.</p> <p>The charges inside that brown envelope, a civil suit alleging complicity in torture and killings, would not make it far in the courts. Seven months later Rajapaksa, a member of Sri Lanka’s most powerful political dynasty, would be elected president, and be granted immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>But since Rajapaksa’s presidency came to an abrupt end this month as he fled abroad and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/15/sri-lanka-mps-to-elect-new-president-after-gotabaya-rajapaksa-officially-resigns\">resigned in disgrace</a>, accused of bankrupting Sri Lanka, lawyers, activists and victims around the world have swung into action. Stripped of the protections of his office, many believe that, finally, this could be an opportunity for justice.</p> <p>On Sunday, the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP), which has spent more than a decade doggedly collecting evidence on Rajapaksa and brought the initial 2019 US civil suit, filed a criminal complaint with the attorney general in Singapore, where he is hiding out. It is seeking his arrest for alleged war crimes under the country’s Geneva conventions act. Lawyers say other lawsuits may soon follow.</p> <p>“We are excited, this is a moment of opportunity,” said Yasmin Sooka, a human rights lawyer with the ITJP. “We’ve spent years collating an extensive dossier on Gotabaya and a pattern of international violations going back to 1989. Now he no longer has immunity, we are confident we have a credible case he has to answer.”</p> <p>The message it sent to victims, added Sooka, was “very powerful; the idea that this man, who was known in Sri Lanka as ‘The Terminator’, can be finally held accountable”.</p> <p>Though rare, there have been cases where war criminals who escaped abroad have been prosecuted and sentenced under universal jurisdiction. Sooka confirmed the ITJP was also considering re-filing the US civil case and would be pushing for foreign governments to place sanctions on Rajapaksa’s assets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/16/i-screamed-and-cried-how-sri-lankan-protesters-unseated-their-president\">‘I screamed and cried’: how Sri Lankan protesters unseated their president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The accusations against Rajapaksa date from late 2008 onwards, when he was defence secretary and head of the armed forces in Sri Lanka. It was during this time, when his older brother Mahinda was president, that he oversaw the ending of Sri Lanka’s 26-year-long civil war between the Tamil separatist militant group known as the Tamil Tigers and Sri Lankan government forces.</p> <p>Barbaric methods were allegedly used and approved by Rajapaksa. According the UN, backed up by witness accounts and video footage, there were “credible allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity”, including systematic murder, torture and sexual violence against tens of thousands of Tamil civilians and the summary execution of prisoners by government forces.</p> <p>Citizens were enticed to safe no-fire zones in the Tamil-controlled areas in the north, only to be bombarded by deadly shelling from government forces, with dozens of hospitals and humanitarian facilities targeted. Thousands who surrendered were taken in and never seen again. In those final phases of the war, estimates of the dead range from 40,000-100,000. Even in the years that followed, thousands more were subjected to enforced disappearances and white van abductions, where they were often tortured and rarely returned. According to the ITJP and others, the responsibility and chain of command for these actions ended directly with Rajapaksa. He denies all the allegations.</p> <p>Yet despite numerous damning reports, UN resolutions and recommendations and an international outcry, Rajapaksa never faced a domestic or international courtroom. After his brother lost power in 2015, Rajapaksa moved freely to the US, gaining citizenship. In 2019, still heralded as a war hero by Sri Lanka’s Sinhalese Buddhist majority, he returned to Sri Lanka and was voted in as president. The limited progress towards wartime justice and reconciliation was halted, military generals who had faced convictions for war crimes were pardoned and the persecution of Tamils escalated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"215ddc4692091264f7f36762ad39ade79f80a48b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/215ddc4692091264f7f36762ad39ade79f80a48b/0_94_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gotabaya Rajapaksa  \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gotabaya Rajapaksa was immune from prosecution while he was president.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But with Rajapaksa’s dramatic fall from grace has come a new appetite for accountability. While the overwhelming cry from protesters on the streets in Colombo has been a call for him and his family to face corruption charges, human rights organisations and victims have begun vocally pushing for investigations to look beyond financial crime and extend to Rajapaksa’s persecution of the Tamil and Muslim minorities, who are mainly concentrated in Sri Lanka’s northern and eastern provinces, as well as activists, journalists and political opponents.</p> <p>“We never dreamed this would become a possibility, where President Rajapaksa had to run away for his own safety,” said Leeladevi Aanandarajah, 70, whose son Aanandanadarasa Anura was taken into military custody in the Tamil region of Vavuniya in 2009 and never seen again.</p> <p>Alongside hundreds of other Tamil mothers, Aanandarajah has spent years trying to find answers about her son, including testifying before police and commissions. Yet their calls for justice have consistently been ignored and she has faced constant harassment, surveillance and abuse from the authorities and military. Many of the mothers of the disappeared are now dying before they get answers.</p> <p>Like most in the north and east, her hopes now rest on the international community stepping in. “With President Rajapaksa’s resignation, now we are hopeful of pursuing all available avenues with the support of our diaspora communities abroad to bring him before the international criminal court in order to ensure justice is provided to us,” she said. “What we demand is justice for our children, nothing else.”</p> <p>The ITJP is not the only group looking at renewed legal action against Rajapaksa. In 2019, a US civil action was brought against Rajapaksa for his alleged role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/13/wickrematunga-final-editorial-final-editorial\">murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge</a>, a journalist who reported on Rajapaksa’s alleged involvement in corruption and was subsequently killed by a military hit squad directly under his command. More than a dozen other critical journalists were killed during that time in similar circumstances.</p> <p>Nushin Sarkarati, a lawyer with the Center for Justice and Accountability in the US, who filed the case on behalf of Wickrematunge’s daughter but had to withdraw it after Rajapaksa became president, said this felt like “a new moment of opportunity”, one they intended to seize.</p> <p>“We’re in discussion with the family about what the next steps are: whether civil litigation is still the right way forward or is there more fervour to push for criminal action against Gotabaya?” said Sarkarati.</p> <p>Previous pleas by the UN human rights commissioner for members states to open up investigations into war crimes in Sri Lanka in their own countries, and then seek Rajapaksa’s arrest under universal jurisdiction, have come to nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/22/sri-lanka-security-forces-raid-protest-camp-as-ranil-wickremesinghe-flexes-muscles\">Sri Lanka security forces raid protest camp as Ranil Wickremesinghe flexes muscles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Sarkarati said that with the “groundswell of support and calls for justice for the myriad abuses that he’s been linked to”, several human rights groups were now pushing governments, including the US, to reopen old criminal investigations into Rajapaksa. “A government like the US could open an investigation and then seek his extradition,” said Sarkarati.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the pathway to Rajapaksa facing trial is riddled with uncertainty. If the authorities in Singapore let him freely leave after his visitor visa expires in early August, a cabinet minister has indicated that Rajapaksa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/wickremesinghe-sri-lanka-pm-could-have-severe-consequences-analysis\">intends to return to Sri Lanka</a>.</p> <p>KS Ratnavale, a senior lawyer who has worked on hundreds of cases of enforced disappearances and massacre victims, said there remained little likelihood of Rajapaksa facing trial for war crimes within Sri Lanka where all domestic accountability mechanisms had so far failed and Rajapaksa’s political allies were still running the country.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/ranil-wickremesinghe-wily-fox-who-became-sri-lanka-pm-six-times-profile\">new president, Ranil Wickremesinghe</a>, is among those accused of protecting the Rajapaksa family in the past and of complicity in obstructing civil war justice. When he was prime minister, from 2015-2019, Wickremesinghe never set up the promised hybrid courts – intended to put leaders on both sides on trial for grave violations of human rights in the civil war – and had refused to dismantle the military units in the north accused by Tamils of committing the worst war crimes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wickremesinghe’s actions since becoming president this month, including reappointing Kamal Gunaratne, a former commander of the 53 Division of the Sri Lankan army accused of committing alleged war crimes, as secretary to the ministry of defence, have also not inspired confidence among Tamil groups calling for justice.</p> <p>“Whatever government comes to power, it covers up the atrocities and crimes committed against civilians and unarmed personnel and entrenched immunity is given to armed forces and paramilitary groups,” said Ratnavale. “That’s why victims are demanding an international probe.”</p> <p>For the mothers of the disappeared who are still waiting for justice, the fall of Rajapaksa, while a symbolic victory, was not enough to convince them that they would finally be granted the accountability and answers they have craved for 13 years.</p> <p>Kathirkamanathan Kokilavani, 52, from Kilinochchi, lost her 18-year-old son as they were escaping from heavy shelling and barrel bombing, and never saw him again. “I don’t believe whoever comes into power will give us answers, because they are scared of the truth,” she said. “The Rajapaksas made our children disappear; now they have disappeared from politics.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/28/west-virginia-girl-12-speaks-out-against-anti-abortion-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T01:38:16Z","webTitle":"‘What about my life?’ West Virginia girl, 12, speaks out against anti-abortion bill ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/west-virginia-girl-12-speaks-out-against-anti-abortion-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/west-virginia-girl-12-speaks-out-against-anti-abortion-bill","fields":{"headline":"‘What about my life?’ West Virginia girl, 12, speaks out against anti-abortion bill ","trailText":"Plea by Addison Gardner during public hearing against bill that would prohibit procedure in nearly all cases goes viral","byline":"Maya Yang","body":"<p>An impassioned plea from a 12-year-old girl has gone viral after she spoke to West Virginia Republican lawmakers during a public hearing for an abortion bill that would prohibit the procedure in nearly all cases.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Addison Gardner of Buffalo middle school in Kenova, West Virginia, was among several people who spoke out against the bill.</p> \n<p>Addressing the West Virginia house of delegates, Gardner, among about 90 other speakers, was given 45 seconds to plead her case.</p> \n<p>“My education is very important to me and I plan on doing great things in life.

We must have a language that is very respectful because we don’t want people being turned away, or at least not engaging in health services, for fear of being stigmatised, for fear of being judged.”</p> <p>Colin Batrouney, Thorne Harbour Health’s director of health promotion, policy and communications, said public health messaging needs to strike a balance between raising awareness and not causing panic. </p> <p>“Our focus has been on what monkeypox is, how it is contracted, symptoms, treatment and prevention,” he said. “Our approach to sexual health and wellbeing has always been one of non-judgemental, clear information and positivity.”</p> <p>“The only moral dimension to the disease will be the inability or unwillingness of systems and governments around the world to deal with it.”</p> <p>Atagi has identified gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men as at highest risk, as well as sex workers. Grulich said it would make sense to prioritise gay and bisexual men who have travelled internationally for vaccination, followed by all highly sexually active gay and bisexual men.</p> <p>“Australia is a little bit fortunate that this has happened in the depths of winter when there’s not a lot in the way of great big gay gatherings for gay men,” he said.</p> <p>That will change when Sydney hosts WorldPride in February and March next year, and people will travel from all across the world.</p> <p>“It’s utterly critical that sexually active gay men be vaccinated. We’ve got a few months for that, we mustn’t lose sight of that, Grulich said.</p> <p>“It’s quite conceivable that we could get the great majority of sexually active gay men vaccinated in that time.”</p> <p>Paynter agreed.</p> <p>“I think we could really go close towards herd immunity through vaccination, subject to having enough supply of the vaccine.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/29/liv-golf-bedminster-first-round-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-30T00:53:37Z","webTitle":" Golf takes back seat at Saudi-backed, Trump-hosted event","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/liv-golf-bedminster-first-round-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/29/liv-golf-bedminster-first-round-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":" Golf takes back seat at Saudi-backed, Trump-hosted event","trailText":"Henrik Stenson and Patrick Reed were the overnight leaders at the third LIV Golf event, which played out before sparse crowds at Donald Trump’s Bedminster club","byline":"Bryan Armen Graham at Trump National Golf Club","body":"<p>Shortly after the three-man paratrooper unit of former US Navy Seals carrying a jumbo-sized American flag touched down amid the screaming guitars of AC/DC’s Thunderstruck at ear-splitting volumes, Phil Mickelson was interrupted by a heckler as he stood over his first shot on the 16th tee.</p> <p>“Do it for the Saudi royal family!”</p> <p>Talk about awkward. The six-time major champion stepped away from his ball, composed himself as the gallery stirred before depositing his tee shot into a greenside bunker. And it only got stranger from there on a muggy, overcast Friday afternoon as the third event of the controversial LIV Golf Invitational Series creaked to life at Trump National Golf Club in the central New Jersey farm town of Bedminster.</p> <p>Henrik Stenson and Patrick Reed were the joint overnight leaders at seven-under-par through 18 holes, two shots ahead of Thailand’s Phachara Khongwatmai and three better than Dustin Johnson and Carlos Ortiz. But the golf itself at the $25m Saudi-backed event continues to take a back seat to the ample controversy outside the ropes.</p> <p>The steady backlash from critics who have accused the Saudi government of using their reported $2bn investment to sanitize the kingdom’s dismal human rights record, severe repression of women’s and LGBTQ+ rights and the 2018 murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi has been well-documented since the breakaway golf tour was formally announced in March. Same for its alleged ties to the September 11 attacks, which prompted a large protest on Friday morning led by survivors and victims’ families at the public library four miles down the road from the 500-acre grounds of Trump National. (That the former US president continues to plaster the presidential seal all over his club <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/29/trump-presidential-seal-liv-golf-tournament/\">in violation of federal law</a> is so far down the laundry list it scarcely warrants mention.)</p> <p>But it was the surprising dearth of spectators on hand for Friday’s opening round of the 54-hole, no-cut tournament – a shock even in light of LIV Golf’s flickering lifespan – that left more questions than answers on what return the tour’s Saudi backers can realistically expect on their investment.</p> <p>For all of LIV Golf’s bluster about being a fan-focused alternative to the PGA Tour, there certainly weren’t many around to enjoy it as the third instalment kicked off. Organizers declined to issue official attendance figures, but Friday’s session played out before no more than a couple thousand fans despite a largely papered house and $75 grounds passes going for $2 on the secondary market. Volunteers began to outnumber punters on the more far-flung areas of the 7,591-yard Old Course, while the sparsely populated Fan Village – a cluster of outsourced food trucks, merch tents and corporate installations on a windswept plot of dead grass near the 11th fairway – bore an unnerving resemblance to Steven Yeun’s deserted theme park in the third act of Nope.</p> <p>This is big-time sport as Potemkin village. All the earmarks of a major event – household names drawn by eye-watering $25m purses, nine-figure signing-on fees and <a href=\"https://golfweek.usatoday.com/2022/07/07/liv-golf-private-plane-lounge-full-bar-dustin-johnson-pat-perez/\">garish perks</a> – have not compensated for the credibility of a competition with no meaningful history or world ranking points at stake in a package that manages to come off as overproduced and slapdash at the same time.</p> <p>The biggest crowds of the afternoon were reserved for Donald Trump, who led a caravan of golf carts around the grounds alongside Yasir al-Rumayyan, the golf-obsessed former banker and Newcastle United chairman who governs the Saudi Public Investment Fund. With nine holes to go, the former US president pulled up to the clubhouse as LCD Soundsystem blared from the loudspeakers surrounded by hundreds of giddy supporters and took in the finish from a custom-built terrace along the 16th tee, chatting with Caitlyn Jenner while pausing intermittently for photo-ops with VIP ticketholders. The fishbowl-like enclosure offered his fans outside a minute-by-minute view of the one-time chief executive, who was easily identifiable even at distance in his red Make America Great Again cap.</p> <p>Even as Reed raced to the top of the leaderboard with six birdies from the 4th through the 10th holes to be matched by the late-charging Stenson, fresh off his removal as Europe’s Ryder Cup captain as a result of his defection, the biggest news items of the day took place away from the course.</p> <p>Charles Barkley, the basketball legend turned beloved broadcaster, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/07/29/charles-barkley-ends-contract-flirtation-with-liv-golf/\">ended speculation</a> that he would leave his longtime post on Inside the NBA for a LIV Golf commentary gig. Not long after, two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson became the latest big name to cut ties with the PGA Tour, becoming the 12th major champion to join the renegade circuit. Hard to say whether it will make a difference, but the empty sensation of Friday’s affair portends an uphill climb.</p> <p>Mickelson, who was reportedly paid a guaranteed $200m to join the LIV Tour as a player and lead recruiter, said he wasn’t disappointed by the heckler in an area where he’s been wildly popular after carding a five-over 75 that left him tied for 46th out of 48.</p> <p>“No, I had a really good day,” he said. “I’m just frustrated because I expect more of myself.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"crosswords/weekend/603","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T23:00:09Z","webTitle":"Weekend crossword No 603","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/weekend/603","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/weekend/603","fields":{"headline":"Weekend crossword No 603","trailText":"Weekend crossword No 603","byline":"Sy","body":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/prize/28823","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T23:00:08Z","webTitle":"Prize crossword No 28,823","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/prize/28823","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/prize/28823","fields":{"headline":"Prize crossword No 28,823","trailText":"Prize crossword No 28,823","byline":"Paul","body":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"crosswords/quick/16296","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T23:00:08Z","webTitle":"Quick crossword No 16,296","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quick/16296","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quick/16296","fields":{"headline":"Quick crossword No 16,296","trailText":"Quick crossword No 16,296","body":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/29/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-culture-war-woke-nonsense","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T22:51:27Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak seeks to revive faltering No 10 bid by attacking ‘woke nonsense’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-culture-war-woke-nonsense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/29/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-culture-war-woke-nonsense","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak seeks to revive faltering No 10 bid by attacking ‘woke nonsense’","trailText":"Ex-chancellor vows to stop leftwing agitators ‘bulldozing’ British values as Tugendhat backs Truss","byline":"Heather Stewart and Aubrey Allegretti","body":"<p>Rishi Sunak will seek to revive his flagging bid for the premiership on Saturday by wading in to a series of so-called culture war issues, vowing to stop “leftwing agitators” from “bulldozing” British values.</p> \n<p>With Liz Truss the firm favourite ahead of a critical few days in the leadership contest, and ballot papers set to be received by Conservative party members from Monday, Sunak will give a speech attacking “woke nonsense”.</p> \n<p>While the former chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2022/jul/18/tory-leadership-election-full-results\">came first</a> in a vote of Tory MPs, Truss has consistently led in party members’ polls and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/ben-wallace-attacks-rishi-sunak-cabinet-resignation-after-backing-truss\">won the endorsement</a> of former favourite Ben Wallace on Thursday, underlining the sense that her campaign is picking up momentum.

And then on top of that, we talk about players but not history – it is the here and now.”</p> <p>Wiegman has settled rapidly since her arrival in England after taking the Netherlands to the Tokyo Olympics last summer. She has taken to drinking tea and eating fish and chips as a part of her assimilation of English culture.</p> <p>She has perhaps made more changes to her diet than she did the team. “I knew of course that over the years England had been really good already,” she said of her arrival last September. “So, it’s not like I thought I’m going to come in and change everything, because things were really good already.</p> <p>The team and women’s football in England is so big and it’s had such an incredible development, so I just wanted to figure out what could I, with the technical staff, add to this team to take the next step in the development.”</p> <p>A key part of that development has been instilling a calmness into the fabric of the squad and the team. To maintain her own calm, she does yoga and meditates daily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46faf9ac1bc2c0a693149972402914a131b1ed60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46faf9ac1bc2c0a693149972402914a131b1ed60/0_104_3127_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarina Wiegman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarina Wiegman has played down England’s rivalry with Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I just make sure I do all those things and stay calm,” she says. “We are so well prepared, that gives me calmness too. I know we have done everything in our control. It might bring us a win or maybe not, but we know we have done everything within our control to do as well as possible and that’s OK.”</p> <p>The key to her calmness has been built through understanding who she is as a person. “Over the years I’ve learned – and I think this is the main thing – about myself as much as possible.</p> <p>That takes time. You need confidence to make choices. I was a teacher when I was in my first job as a coach with ADO Den Haag. When I started there were so many things on the path in front of me and I had to learn more about myself.</p> <p>You learn your strengths and weaknesses. Over time you get so much experience that you trust yourself and get confidence. You know you did the right thing, no matter what the response of the person in front of you is.”</p> <p>In the Netherlands there is no resentment of Wiegman for having left the national team for England. Instead there is immense pride as her side go into the game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/battle-for-the-golden-boot-mead-and-popp-have-dual-goals-in-their-sights\" title=\"\">against the record eight-times European champions</a>.</p> <p>There is a feeling that she more than did her time with the Netherlands, exceeding expectations by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/06/womens-euro-2017-holland-denmark-match-report\" title=\"\">lifting a home Euros</a> in 2017, and many are excited to see what she does with the resources of a country that is a few steps ahead in its development of women’s football.</p> <p>“That’s really nice,” she says in response to being told what journalists are saying in her home country. “When I started my coaching, I didn’t even know it was possible to be a full-time coach. So now it’s just really nice. I am very aware of where we’ve come from with the women’s game and where we are now and I’m just really enjoying it. I feel very privileged today to be part of this whole journey from little kids.”</p> <p>Wiegman refers the players to the memory of playing as a child and says they should play for the little girls who want to be there, said the midfielder Georgia Stanway, who has shone at the Euros.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89ded72e841e0813d37c045297ad5a86ca7aed8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ded72e841e0813d37c045297ad5a86ca7aed8d/0_52_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georgia Stanway pictured on Friday looking forward to the final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgia Stanway pictured on Friday looking forward to the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The biggest thing that Sarina has said was at the start: ‘Play for the little girl that wanted to be in our shoes.’ So, I’ll play for the little girl who wanted to play at the start, went to training, loved it, dreamed to be in our position.”</p> <p>Stanway has been another highlight of England’s tournament, but that was not predictable. In fact, she had been told she was on the edge of plans.</p> <p>“When Sarina first came into the job I don’t think I was in favour. I was still playing full-back at the time at Manchester City and I was trying to fight for a spot in England at centre mid and I was finding that balance really hard.

That is part of the deal. That can happen at the end of the season with the points tally. It didn’t turn me crazy and it didn’t turn the players crazy either. Because it is part of the deal. We can use it to get even more determined. There is no guarantee for any kind of results. We will not win one football game this season because we won it last season, not at all because it makes it even more difficult. Everybody wants to hurt us, to win against us, to get a point against us, so it will be really tough but we will give it a try.”</p> <p>The Premier League champions have strengthened this summer with the signings of Erling Haaland and Kalvin Phillips but Klopp believes Liverpool, who have bought Darwin Núñez, Fábio Carvalho and Calvin Ramsay, can also improve on a season that held ambitions of an unprecedented quadruple until the final week. “First of all, we spent money as well, we should not forget that,” he said. “We lost three first team players – Sadio [Mané], Divock [Origi], Taki [Minamino], very important players for us – and brought in three. We want to create space for our young boys from last year to step into the void.</p> <p>“We had a big meeting where I told the boys what I expect from them next year.

We don’t know where it will lead us but we know it will improve us. We don’t have to reinvent ourselves, that is not necessary, but we can include new things here and there. That is what we are really working on.”</p> <p>Liverpool will be without their first- and second-choice goalkeepers at the King Power Stadium with Alisson’s understudy, Caoimhín Kelleher, facing another two to three weeks on the sidelines. Adrián will deputise. Klopp says his squad may not be ready for the Community Shield due to a short pre-season and believes both teams need time to integrate their new big-name forwards. He explained: “We watched the Bayern game and it was not too different. Erling scored a Manchester City goal, from a square ball in the six-yard box, and so far it didn’t change a lot. They have the same problem we have – they are not used to Erling’s natural runs, just as we are not used to Darwin’s natural runs yet. When Darwin offers a run we give him the ball all the time, which is not helpful because often a guy who stretches the opponent is there to create space between the lines.</p> <p>“I am pretty sure they will need time for Erling but that doesn’t mean he cannot score already like he did against Bayern. Most of the things look like last year, how they set up the press, how flexible they are in their own possession. It is good, very very good, but so far no real change is obvious.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/29/guardiola-backs-new-strike-duo-haaland-and-alvarez-to-fire-city-to-more-glory","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T21:30:07Z","webTitle":"Guardiola backs new strike duo Haaland and Álvarez to fire City to more glory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/guardiola-backs-new-strike-duo-haaland-and-alvarez-to-fire-city-to-more-glory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/29/guardiola-backs-new-strike-duo-haaland-and-alvarez-to-fire-city-to-more-glory","fields":{"headline":"Guardiola backs new strike duo Haaland and Álvarez to fire City to more glory","trailText":"The Manchester City manager, who could play his new signings in the Community Shield, says ‘Erling and Julián have this incredible talent to score goals’","byline":"Jamie Jackson","body":"<p>Pep Guardiola is confident Erling Haaland and Julián Álvarez can be prolific goalscorers in their first seasons at Manchester City.</p> <p>Both forwards could both start in Saturday’s Community Shield against Liverpool at the King Power Stadium after joining the Premier League champions this summer.

And after we have the feeling that they will score. But if we play no good, if we play bad, they will not score goals that’s for sure.”</p> <p>Guardiola does not believe City’s style will alter markedly following the arrival of Haaland and Álvarez. “They both have the ability to drop [off] and play football,” he said. “I don’t like strikers waiting in the box to score a goal, even for them it is boring. If you ask them, they want to touch the ball, they want to play and that is what we have to do. And after they have the special sense, smell, quality to score a goal – they will do the rest. I can’t teach them to score goals, they know what they have to do.”</p> <p>In Haaland City have acquired one of the world’s most-coveted strikers. Guardiola offered an insight into his character. “He’s ready to play, and the first impression as a guy is really good – a funny guy,” said the manager. “He has settled really well with the team. That is important. Apparently people think it’s not one of the most important things but it is: good vibes in the locker room is more important than any advice or any other thing you can say.</p> <p>“We try to settle well [his] family … try to get to know each other in training, see what we want to do, what we did in previous seasons. When I see [him] in the canteen and corridors around the club it’s really good. The new guys are embraced really well from the guys here from day one, that’s why it’s so easy.”</p> <p>Haaland, though, is not 100% fit. “When I spoke with him over the last few days, he felt a little bit but he can train and move,” Guardiola said. “At the end of August he will be better. Now we have one game a week, with more training. After that we start the crazy schedule.”</p> <p>Guardiola also confirmed that he will be without centre-back Aymeric Laporte until September: “He is injured. He had knee surgery after last season – [he] played the last two or three games with an important injury, making an incredible effort.</p> <p>“So far he is doing really well but you have to be careful with a knee problem.

It was the 32-year-old’s 100th dismissal in the short-form of the game, making her the first man or woman in Twenty20 history to reach the mark. </p> <p>Australian captain Meg Lanning praised Healy, though her good fortune did not extend to batting, with the opener dismissed for a duck on the second ball of the innings. “Alyssa is an amazing player and has been for a long period of time and to

successful middle-class migrants prepared to turn away asylum seekers with a valid claim”, he replied defiantly: “No.”</p> \n<p>Though Sunak admitted only several hundred migrants may be removed under the plan that will cost millions, he said many thousands would be deterred from trying to cross the Channel to claim asylum in the UK.</p> \n<p>Among the questions put to him was whether he was embarrassed by a clip aired on the BBC when Sunak was in his early 20s. It showed the now-Tory leadership contender being interviewed as part of a programme on class.</p> \n<p>“I have friends who are aristocrats, I have friends who are upper class, I have friends who are working class – well, not working class,” said Sunak in the 2001 clip.</p> \n<p>The footage was latched upon in the race to replace Johnson when it re-surfaced several weeks ago, with rivals scornful and suggesting it showed the wealthy Tory MP would not be able to relate to those struggling during the cost of living crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc3067f8-77dd-4c9b-8fe6-585947b1cb68\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wi4KAJtK3fA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sunak addressed the video when pressed about whether he was out of touch by Neil. “We all say silly things when we’re students,” he admitted.</p> \n<p>“I grew up working in my mum’s pharmacy, and you don’t end up doing that unless you interact with lots of people. I spent my time making sure we served our community.</p> \n<p>“My parents worked incredibly hard to provide opportunities for me and that’s ultimately why I want to be prime minister because this country allowed my family to provide a better opportunity and future for me.”</p> \n<p>Sunak, who several polls of Tory members have found is trailing behind Truss in the leadership contest, was also tackled over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/14/rishi-sunak-warns-tory-rivals-against-unsustainable-tax-cuts\">refusal to cut taxes</a> and an alleged “U-turn” over cutting VAT on energy bills.</p> \n<p>Sunak had argued against the tax cut in question in February when he was chancellor, telling the Commons the policy “would disproportionately benefit wealthier households”.</p> \n<p>On Friday, he admitted it was a blunt instrument but said it was one of the few levers that politicians could pull quickly.</p> \n<p>He said the apparent volte-face was “absolutely not” a case of poor judgment initially and claimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/21/liz-truss-tax-spending-plans-consternation-economists\">Truss’ tax cuts – £30bn</a> to be funded by borrowing – would put “fuel on the fire” of already-spiralling inflation.</p> \n<p>Sunak said the move would be a “sugar rush” that would also push up interest rates and make worse the economic difficulties many will face this winter.</p> \n<p>Despite being invited for a similar grilling by Neil, Truss followed the lead of Johnson at the last general election and refused to do so.</p> \n<p>At the end of Friday’s programme, Neil said: “She declined our invitation. Her choice of course. That invitation still remains open.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n</figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/29/digested-week-waking-early-working-late-relentless-deadlines-its-the-holidays","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T21:11:27Z","webTitle":"Digested week: waking early, working late, relentless deadlines – it’s the holidays!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/digested-week-waking-early-working-late-relentless-deadlines-its-the-holidays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/digested-week-waking-early-working-late-relentless-deadlines-its-the-holidays","fields":{"headline":"Digested week: waking early, working late, relentless deadlines – it’s the holidays!","trailText":"Football joy, eBay nerves and trips to the GP make for a thoroughly magical time","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<h2>Monday</h2> <p>We are on holiday. This is a complete misnomer. What I mean is: the school holidays have begun, I’m taking half-weeks off work for nearly the duration, and getting up early and going to bed late to get the rest of it done outside child-waking hours.</p> <p>It’s a magical time.</p> <p>In the old days, of course, this unbroken six weeks of quality time with my offspring would be ameliorated by sending him to his grandparents’ for a few days at a time, to be fêted<strong> </strong>and petted instead of snarled at for interfering with deadlines. But Covid and shielding – these are both still things, by the way! – have put paid to that.</p> <p>We used to send him on occasional “fun” day courses and things but now that he is old enough to refuse, he has refused. He hates sports and people. I don’t know where he gets it from.</p> <p>So now it’s Audible (“Read a book! Read a BOOK!” “My EARS are reading!”), Joe Wicks – this is still a thing too, at least for the inert, introvert child who must nevertheless be required to raise his heart rate at least once a day – day trips when it’s not killingly hot outside, board games when it is and, by my approximate count, five meals and 17 substantial snacks a day, every day.</p> <p>A. Magical. Time.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>“Help me to the sofa,” I gasped, pale, sweating and spent, spent utterly.</p> <p>“What’s wrong?” said my husband, as he laid me gently upon the two-seater, which is not very comfortable but you can’t get the 19th century lovers these days.</p> <p>“I have … I have been bidding on eBay,” I said faintly.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, I am strictly a buy-it-now punter. I don’t even make offers – the stress is incapacitating. But every now and again, normal rules must be set aside, and a rare discontinued Ikea armchair cover had come up, auction only. So I had partaken.</p> <p>I don’t know how people do this on the regular. I only sit there for the last 10 minutes and within two I am literally shaking with nerves. Within four I am retching into a bucket with nerves. I place my one and only bid in the last moments before I entirely lose control of my faculties and have to go to bed for 48 hours to recover.</p> <p>And – here’s the thing – it’s worse if, as I did here, I win. I feel guilty for depriving someone else of the thing, or not paying as much as someone else might have if the seller had listed at a different time, or, or, or …</p> <p>I sometimes think modern life is not for me.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>There is a gorgeous video doing the rounds on social media of a young girl of eight or nine dancing and pumping the air in celebration of the Lionesses winning their match against Sweden 4-0 and going through to the Euro 22 final. </p> <p>Someone has added the caption to the effect that she hasn’t known a time when women didn’t play football, which is – obviously – lovely, but you really don’t need more than the sight of her. Genuinely delighted, glorying completely in the moment, her pleasure unalloyed and throwing herself about completely freely and unselfconsciously, it is a rare thing. </p> <p>By that age, I realise as I watch her, girls are usually already being careful. Careful with their bodies, careful how much space they take up, careful how much real feeling they expose to the world – very sensibly, given how hostile to them it has often been to them already and how clearly it will become more so the older they get. </p> <p>It’s one of the many things Derry Girls, for example, gets right – the gurning exuberance of the girls when they are all together, and the slight quietness that steals over them when they are split up.</p> <p>We need more Lioness moments.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>Now, I’m no economics expert – I still don’t really understand how it is that we … print money? We literally make the money we also earn and spend? It seems all wrong to me. It should issue forth spontaneously from some kind of divinely touched block of gold we all pay daily obeisance to or something, shouldn’t it? And don’t go sending in any clever-clever jokes or explanations about how in many ways this is what happens because I don’t even know enough to get them.</p> <p>Sorry, where was I? Ah yes. No economics expert, BUT. When news reaches us on the same day that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/mcdonalds-uk-raises-price-of-cheeseburger-for-first-time-in-14-years\">price of a McDonald’s cheeseburger is going up</a> for the first time in 14 years, and Asia’s richest woman has lost half her $24bn fortune in China’s property crisis, I start stockpiling beans and no one can persuade me otherwise.</p> <p>My larder is back to post-Brexit, pre-lockdown levels of repletion. Coffee, pasta, rice, beans, pasta, soup, flour, pasta, salt, coffee, pasta, coffee. All the basics are here. What once I might have spent on frills and furbelows (Lingbo seat covers notwithstanding), I now spend on caffeine and long-life carbs. </p> <p>It’s still cheaper than proper therapy, which is of course the role it is actually taking. These nutritional fragments have I shored against my mental ruin.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>I go to the GP about getting a mole removed (not a dangerous one – it’s just painful and looks like a second head growing out of my back). She, as she always does as part of the consultation process, asks how I would feel about considering coming off my antidepressants.</p> <p>“Depressed,” I say.</p> <p>She persists. I demur. “Have you seen – I say, gesturing widely, in a manner intended to take in everything from the roadworks outside, to Brexit, to Ukraine – “all this?”</p> <p>She persists. I decide to distract her by mentioning a couple of other health issues that I wasn’t going to bring up because I didn’t think there was anything she could do about them.</p> <p>“There’s X and Y,” I say.</p> <p>“Hmm,” she says. “Well, we often recommend your antidepressants for taking the edge of X too, and there’s some evidence they also help Y.”</p> <p>“Really?” I say, delighted that the seemingly separately failing parts of my dismal little body seem to be working in some kind of deeper concert.</p> <p>“Really,” she says.</p> <p>So take heart, ladies and gentlemen. Occasionally, just occasionally, middle age can really work for you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f92517951120e2ab41398cc6d4c89bbe1c36f0f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f92517951120e2ab41398cc6d4c89bbe1c36f0f6/0_0_4693_2817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panda cub\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m a what?

Following more than 8,900 episodes, tonight we finally say goodbye to the residents of Ramsay Street, as the Australian soap is cancelled after 37 years. Although Neighbours has fans all over the world – many of whom are reading this (hello to you!) – no other British broadcaster or streamer has decided to pick up the soap, so tonight it’s farewell.</p> <p>Even though there will be an obvious melancholic tinge to proceedings, let this also be a celebration of all the things that made Neighbours so great. There are of course ridiculous storylines, from “Plain Jane Superbrain” taking off her glasses, to the time Paige had sex with a Catholic priest in the middle of a hot air balloon disaster, or when Susan thought she was a teenager after slipping on milk and banging her head. </p> <p>But there are also heartbreaking moments we will never forget. Personally, I am still not over Stingray dying at that BBQ. Or the time that a character was blinded because a dog ran off with the safety glasses during a total eclipse.</p> <p>The final episodes that have been running all week have sparked a wave of nostalgia. A highlight for me was a video Neighbours uploaded the other day on Twitter consisting of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neighbours/status/1551296157044723712?s=20&amp;t=-TgYhOM9gPXS_Dkan9hrjw\">Toadie</a> (Ryan Moloney) reeling off some of his favourite memories: “I’ve had some fond memories on this street,” he said. “I was kidnapped and shot. I broke my back on a bouncy castle … and one of my weddings literally exploded.”</p> <p>It must also be noted that, despite the show’s ludicrous side, Neighbours has been covering sensitive issues with heart, especially in recent years. And it never took itself too seriously, with an upbeat quality that always felt like an antidote to the unnecessary grittiness of some other soaps. It felt like a rarity on television: a show that was always warm and inviting to both new viewers and old. It always had that little bit of daytime TV magic.</p> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/neighbours-finale-review-kylie-and-jason-make-30-years-vanish-in-an-instant","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T21:10:06Z","webTitle":"Neighbours finale review – Kylie and Jason make 30 years vanish in an instant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/neighbours-finale-review-kylie-and-jason-make-30-years-vanish-in-an-instant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/neighbours-finale-review-kylie-and-jason-make-30-years-vanish-in-an-instant","fields":{"headline":"Neighbours finale review – Kylie and Jason make 30 years vanish in an instant","trailText":"Charlene! Scott! Margot Robbie in what looks like a toilet! This upbeat, celeb-packed finale was a truly fitting celebration of not just the end of a TV show – but the end of an era","byline":"Frances Ryan","body":"<p>Watching the opening credits on the final episode of Neighbours (Channel 5), with almost four decades of variations of the famous golden typography edited into one, it would not be hyperbole to suggest that it feels like watching your life flash before your eyes. Ramsay Street may be in a fictional suburb on the other side of the world from the UK, but from the start of this nostalgia-filled finale, it’s clear that producers – and viewers – are well aware that this is more than simply the end of a television show. More an era.</p> <p>We begin as we close, with Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) looking tearful as she surveys the street. For sale signs loom over every corner of the cul de sac, with many of the residents planning to leave. Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) is set to sell his beloved Lassiters hotel complex and move to New York. Even Toadie Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) is selling up after 25 years. It is Toadfish’s wedding to Melanie Pearson (Lucinda Cowden) that is the crux of the final episode, ushering in a celebratory mood and most importantly, an excuse for old faces to return.</p> <p>Neighbours<em> </em>birthed a slew of pop legends and Hollywood stars and it’s a testament to the fondness they feel for the show that many choose to return for the finale. Natalie Imbruglia and Holly Valance are on a bench musing about what makes a good singer. Margot Robbie<strong> </strong>says hi on FaceTime, filming from what appears to be her toilet. Guy Pearce looks to be having the time of his life returning as Mike Young, creating a moving reunion with high-school lost love Plain Jane Super Brain (Annie Jones). No appearance is more anticipated, though, than that of Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan. While brief, the novelty of seeing the two of them as 1980s love birds Charlene and Scott once again does not disappoint. Driving on to the street as the car radio blasts Especially for You<em>, </em>Minogue dons a denim jumpsuit with more than a small nod to Charlene’s infamous overalls. Thirty years have passed and no time at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a58b0ced131f8ffe797da7431793f4d63d37523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a58b0ced131f8ffe797da7431793f4d63d37523/0_12_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toadie and Mel’s wedding …\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toadie and Mel’s wedding …</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fremantle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The challenge for the writers was always going to be wrapping up existing plots, while providing sufficient nostalgia for older fans. They do it very well. Former mistress of Karl Kennedy, Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), returns as a homage to one of soapland’s classic affairs (coming back to sleep with Karl’s son then dump him for a millionaire, naturally). Pearce being taken on a tour inside the Ramsay Street houses gives a summary of events for any viewers who have lost track over the years (“How many wives has Paul had?” he asks Jane. “Six.”) Meanwhile, Harold Bishop’s “memory book” enables present-day scenes to be interspersed with classic clips. Seeing legendary characters – Helen Daniels, Madge Bishop, Mrs Mangel – again, and on fuzzy 80s tapes, is a reminder of just how long this Australian suburb has been with us.</p> <p>Any soap ending feels strangely unnatural. Continuing drama is, by its definition, continual. While other shows come into our lives for a few weeks, soaps are with us day in day out through our childhoods, university days, to adulthood. After 37 years, the creators of Neighbours could claim its demise will be particularly keenly felt. They would not be wrong. It is not just that the series has a uniquely positive place in British culture – and not only with fans who haven’t watched it since they were skipping lectures to watch the BBC lunchtime slot. The show was<strong> </strong>still pulling in 1.5 million viewers on Channel 5 when it was axed and despite never being able to reach the halcyon days of the 80s-90s, was still producing <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2022/06/13/neighbours-spoilers-hendrix-dead-in-devastating-tragedy-as-final-scenes-air-16814545/amp/\">headline-worthy storylines</a> in its final weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fb0c1aeac10b85acac9f740ca7fe409d033073c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fb0c1aeac10b85acac9f740ca7fe409d033073c/0_51_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outlandish … the Ramsay Street party rages around Karl and Susan Kennedy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outlandish … the Ramsay Street party rages around Karl and Susan Kennedy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fremantle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, fittingly, most of the departing characters decide to stay on the street, and Paul Robinson holds on to Lassiters. It is a last-minute reprieve, as if to replicate the one fans were hoping to get from television executives.</p> <p>By the time Susan gives her closing monologue as a street party rages around her, even the ghosts of “lost friends” such as Madge Bishop, Doug Willis and Sonya Rebecchi emerging doesn’t seem too outlandish.<strong> </strong>As an errant balloon pops in the sky and confetti rains down on the famous street, the original theme tune starts to play. Charlene clinks a champagne glass with her old friend Paul. This isn’t a finale mourning a show’s demise: it’s a celebration of its success – and what a success it was.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/29/maatsen-fires-burnley-to-winning-start-under-kompany-at-huddersfield","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T20:58:40Z","webTitle":"Maatsen fires Burnley to winning start under Kompany at Huddersfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/maatsen-fires-burnley-to-winning-start-under-kompany-at-huddersfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/29/maatsen-fires-burnley-to-winning-start-under-kompany-at-huddersfield","fields":{"headline":"Maatsen fires Burnley to winning start under Kompany at Huddersfield","trailText":"Ian Maatsen’s goal gave Burnley a winning start under Vincent Kompany with a 1-0 victory at Huddersfield","byline":"Will Unwin at The John Smith's Stadium","body":"<p>Vincent Kompany’s Burnley did not have it all their own way in their victory over Huddersfield but Ian Maatsen’s winner summed up the new-found dynamism to offer a glimpse of what is to come as the defender started and finished an eye-catching move to start the club’s new era with three points.</p> \n<p>The Clarets completed more than 300 passes in the first half, they only achieved such a feat in 90 minutes twice in the entirety of last season to show the early impact of their new manager. No wonder Kompany said he was inspired by Pep Guardiola pre-match. The Manchester City boss will have enjoyed the winner, too, even if it did come from a Chelsea player who marauded into the area from left-back before picking out the bottom corner.</p> \n<p>Burnley went with a revolutionary approach to their new era with six debutants in the starting lineup. Maatsen, a constant threat down the left, and Josh Cullen in midfield were the most impressive of the swathe of recruits from a whirlwind summer that has seen a revolving door transfer policy – and a few more comings and goings can be expected at Turf Moor before the window closes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/qpr-michael-beale-steven-gerrard-manager\">QPR’s Michael Beale: ‘Steven Gerrard is like my football brother’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The heat of the battle seemed to get to Kompany early on; the Belgian felt the need to remove his suit jacket with less than four minutes on the clock. He will not be a tracksuit manner. He watched on while Burnley learned on the job about their new roles and system, but they soon found their feet, much to Kompany’s pleasure.</p> \n<p>Cullen settled the quickest in a pivotal central midfield role, aiding those around him to get up to speed, helping Burnley control the game in the process. He was the man instigating everything positive thanks to his neat touches, passing and ability to read the game, showing why Kompany was so eager for a reunion after working together at Anderlecht. “I know him as a person,” Kompany said. “He helps bring people together, he communicates on the pitch. It is good for him that he was man of the match but knowing him that is not his priority.”</p> \n<p>Burnley fans found their early season cheer during a sustained period of passing, something not witnessed in the Sean Dyche era, with every sideways pass that found its target given a quasi-sarcastic “Olé” by the packed away end as the Clarets dominated possession. “I thought the first half was quite disappointing, I thought tactically maybe we didn’t get it quite right, we lost the middle of the pitch,” Danny Schofield admitted.</p> \n<p>The old and the new combined thanks to clever work from Ashley Barnes to dummy a pass to create space in the box, it would eventually come back to his feet from Josh Brownhill, allowing him to control and inadvertently lay the ball into the path of debutant Maatsen, who showed desire to sprint from the halfway to pounce and curl home.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0e0fb162-35dd-4ea3-9bd0-003d4fe4a3e0\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Swansea and Bristol City have announced they will no longer take the knee before games this season.</p>\n    <p>Both Championship sides, who have adopted the anti-racism gesture since it came into the English game in June 2020, stressed they remain committed to fighting discrimination.</p>\n    <p>The Swansea squad and coaching staff, who visit Rotherham in their season opener on Saturday, said in a statement: \"Following discussions as a group, we have collectively decided to no longer take the knee prior to fixtures during the 2022-23 season.</p>\n    <p>\"This is not a decision that has been taken lightly, and in no way reflects any diminishing of our belief that discrimination of any nature is abhorrent and has no place in football or society. We remain firmly in support of what taking the knee stands for and represents.</p>\n    <p>\"Taking the knee has undoubtedly helped to raise awareness and encourage conversations about how to remove racism from the game we all love. Should any opposition side take the knee before a game this season, then we will line up and applaud them, because we absolutely support the sentiment behind it.\"</p>\n    <p>Bristol City, who head to Hull, said: \"We have taken the knee at every game we have played since June 2020 as an important stance of solidarity in the fight against all forms of discrimination. That battle must continue every day in how we all behave and contribute to society and we will applaud opposition teams who take the knee and raise awareness while ensuring that we have a zero-tolerance approach to hate and abuse.\"</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kompany’s vision of an attacking side was starting to be seen in flashes as confidence grew. Soon after the opener, a second should have arrived when a one-two between Connor Roberts and Cullen saw the full-back latch on to a dink over the top but his close-range jab was stopped by Lee Nicholls.</p> \n<p>Advice was constantly sought on the sidelines by Kompany from predecessor Mike Jackson. While they will be pleased that by having almost three-quarters of possession, the two defenders in the dugout will be ecstatic that they did not concede a shot on target. “I wouldn’t be a manager if I was thrilled with everything. A lot is going to be made, I heard a lot about the style of play. For me at the forefront, it is Burnley and Burnley is hard work. I saw that from the players who were brave. There were some good foundations there,” Kompany said.</p> \n<p>Sensing a shift in dynamic, Schofield, on his managerial debut, made a double substitution by bringing on Jack Rudoni and Tino Anjorin just before the hour mark. The latter made an instant impact when fouled on the edge of the area by Cullen who received a caution for his troubles, while inciting the ire of the crowd.</p> \n<p>Whether Burnley can put in such a sustained effort over a 46-game season is yet to be seen. The players waned in the final stages on a humid night against an unrelenting opposition but, most importantly, managed to hold on. The foundations have been installed for Burnley to build on, all they need to do is reach Kompany’s standards for longer than an hour.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/jul/29/commonwealth-games-2022-day-one-schedule-birmingham-live-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T20:57:21Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth

It is an outcome that was never in doubt and their success is becoming increasingly predictable but it was a result made even more meaningful by the number of deeply impressive performances from competitors both experienced and new.</p> <p>No gymnast had a more spectacular day than Joe Fraser. A day before the team final Fraser, who hails from Birmingham, announced that he would not be able to compete in all six events. After undergoing emergency surgery on his ruptured appendix five weeks ago Fraser worked hard to be ready to compete in the all-around competition, where he would have been the favourite for a gold medal. Instead, despite his efforts, he fractured his right foot two weeks ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/england-alex-yee-wins-first-gold-medal-commonwealth-games-2022-triathlon-birmingham\">England’s Alex Yee wins first gold medal of Commonwealth Games in triathlon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He dons a medical boot outside competition and each time he stepped off the podium, his limp was significant. Yet somehow Fraser was able to continue training on four different apparatuses, dropping out of only the floor exercise and vault, where constant pounding on the feet is unavoidable.</p> <p>When the time came for Fraser to perform, despite his dire preparations, he thrived. In the second rotation he opened his day with one of the classiest pieces of gymnastics on show in Birmingham this year, working his way through a smooth, rhythmic and easy pommel horse routine that scored 14.650 for first place.</p> <p>Fraser followed it up with a spotless routine on rings, scoring 14.450 for second place and sticking the landing on his fractured foot. He repeated the trick as he qualified second on parallel bars, his favourite discipline, and then he also stuck his dismount after an extremely clean high bar routine. At the end of the day Fraser finished in the top two on each of his four apparatuses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bd7583f8e877b70b8e1eec6e2fb5fb466353a26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bd7583f8e877b70b8e1eec6e2fb5fb466353a26/0_83_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Fraser of England performs on the rings .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Fraser of England performs on the rings .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With this session also doubling as qualifying for the individual finals, there were outstanding performances from plenty of others in front of a packed and enthusiastic crowd. After being named as an alternate for Tokyo, the extremely talented 20 year-old Jake Jarman, British champion on floor exercise and vault, soared in his first major championships.</p> <p>He produced an incredible display of vaulting to register a world-class score of 14.975 and qualify in first place. He also qualified third on floor, laying down the highest difficulty but with room to improve. In all he showed he can be a threat in global competitions on both apparatuses.</p> <p>Jarman was close behind Eamon Montgomery of Northern Ireland and Giarnni Regini-Moran, the leader, who scored 13.850 despite stepping out of bounds. After qualifying behind Jarman on vault, Regini-Moran finished first on parallel bars. Rounding off the team, the defending rings champion, Courtney Tulloch, qualified first with a score of 14.700, and the ever consistent James Hall led the all-around standings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/bowls-boxing-basketball-birminghams-bonanza-of-sport\">Bowls, boxing, basketball: Birmingham’s bonanza of sport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In truth England have no competition in the Games as a team. They finished first on every apparatus and, while specific individuals will fight with them for individual medals, the overall standard of gymnastics from other countries drops offconsiderably. It was not too long ago that England was far from the best team in this competition, and their dominance underlines the continued growth of gymnastics in the country.</p> <p>The Cyprus team produced an excellent day of performances to secure a bronze medal. Led by Marios Georgiou, who won two individual gold medals in 2018, they were consistent and clean throughout. Canada finished the day with silver.</p> <p>Earlier in the day the defending pommel horse champion, Rhys McClenaghan of Northern Ireland, qualified for the final in second place, behind Fraser, with a score of 14.350.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/jul/29/tory-leadership-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T20:10:41Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak grilled by Andrew Neil but Liz Truss declines invitation – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jul/29/tory-leadership-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/jul/29/tory-leadership-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak grilled by Andrew Neil but Liz Truss declines invitation – as it happened ","trailText":"Former chancellor, who is trailing Liz Truss, gives broadcast interview","byline":"Nadeem Badshah (now); Nicola Slawson and Geneva Abdul (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62e43ebf8f08c001473274fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T20:10:41.606Z\">9.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This blog is closing now.

abandon pledge to abolish House of Lords</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Keir Starmer has been urged not to abandon a key leadership pledge of abolishing the House of Lords, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/boris-johnson-lords-cronies-legitimising-bribery\">with Gordon Brown warning</a> that plans to “gerrymander” parliament’s upper chamber by flooding it with dozens of Tory peers proved the need for drastic reform.</p> \n  <p>Alarm was raised by the former Labour prime minister over a proposal drawn up by a political lobbying group for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> to appoint up to 50 new Conservatives to ram contentious legislation through given a series of embarrassing defeats by peers.</p> \n  <p>Brown said the leaked document he had seen from CT Group – run by Lynton Crosby, a key adviser to Johnson – “legitimises straightforward bribery” by recommending those who vote loyally be rewarded with special envoy positions, honours and lunches at Chequers.</p> \n  <p>Nicknamed “Operation Homer”, the plan also said new peers would have to give a written undertaking to support the government in key votes on controversial legislation, likely to include the Northern Ireland protocol bill that would unilaterally override the Brexit deal.</p> \n  <p>Under the cover of levelling up the Lords by picking peers from under-represented parts of the UK, the paper admitted it was the “perfect excuse” to ensure a swathe of loyalist law-makers are ennobled.</p> \n  <p>Writing in the Guardian, Brown said the proposal “makes no bones about the defenestrated prime minister’s aim to pack the House of Lords” that would see him “ride roughshod over every convention and standard of propriety in an effort to secure political nominees who will vote for the Tory government”.</p> \n  <p>He added that the paper’s claim the media could be easily blindsided by the appointment of a few controversial figures or celebrities to avoid criticism of the sheer number of “cronies” appointed would amount to “gerrymandering”.</p> \n  <p>“The solution is to reform the Lords, not reinforce its unrepresentativeness,” Brown said, calling for Starmer to pick up the mantel of trying to abolish the un-elected upper chamber in parliament.</p> \n  <p>Read the full story

He had breached Covid regulations, allowed an alleged serial sexual harasser to be appointed to the whips’ office and seen two ethics advisers resign in disgust.</p> \n  <p>Yet cleaning up politics has barely featured in the debate – and indeed, Sunak and Truss have felt the need to defend Johnson, with Sunak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/12/dominic-raab-grant-shapps-back-rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-race\">saying at his launch event</a> that the outgoing prime minister has “a good heart”.</p> \n  <p>There have been some hints at change – Truss said at Thursday’s hustings that she would move the Tory whips’ office back into No 12 Downing Street, to allow MPs’ conduct to be more closely monitored, and Sunak has said he would appoint a new ethics adviser. But neither has fully addressed the need to rebuild public trust in politics after the Johnson era.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read the full story from my colleague Heather Stewart <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/brexit-realism-nhs-some-key-issues-ignored-rishi-sunak-liz-truss\">here</a>:</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/brexit-realism-nhs-some-key-issues-ignored-rishi-sunak-liz-truss\">Brexit realism?

They say members of their family have already been executed due to their connections with the UK, but have been unable to get a response from the Home Office.</p> \n  <p>But in its formal response, published on Friday, to a scathing foreign affairs select committee report released in May on the Afghan evacuation, the Foreign Office said: “If the government were obliged to offer <em>in extremis</em> resettlement to the UK to anyone working on programmes it funded in fragile states where there was a risk of an evacuation being needed, that could severely inhibit the provision of funding to NGOs delivering vital development programming.”</p> \n  <p>Read the full story here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/foreign-office-admits-multiple-errors-in-uks-exit-from-afghanistan\">Foreign Office admits multiple errors in UK’s exit from Afghanistan</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T12:30:41.162Z\">at 1.30pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e3c70f8f08c00147326ea8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T11:43:32.987Z\">12.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour has soared to a 13-point lead in the polls as Conservatives fight among themselves about the future of their party, according to a survey by Savanta for <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/poll-labour-conservative-starmer-johnson-b2133375.html\">The Independent</a>. </p> \n  <p>This lead represents Labour’s second best performance since Keir Starmer became leader in 2019. </p> \n  <p>Compared with a similar poll by Savanta a month ago, Tories shed five points, tumbling from 34% to 29%, while Labour gained a point to move up from 41% to 42%, the Independent says.</p> \n  <p>The previous poll was taken on the weekend of 25-26 June in the wake of the Partygate fines and just days ahead of the Christopher Pincher sexual harassment scandal.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T12:31:45.510Z\">at 1.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e3bed98f08730a1f7f3915\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T11:14:07.774Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sam Tarry says he was proud to be on the picket line with rail workers</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The former shadow transport minister Sam Tarry has written a comment piece for the Guardian in which he says it would have been a dereliction of duty for him as a Labour MP to refuse to join a picket line.</p> \n  <p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, sacked Tarry on Wednesday for giving a series of interviews from a rail union picket line outside Euston station in central London that were not in line with party policy. </p> \n  <p>He points out that that during the three lockdowns we had at the height of the pandemic, Rail employees “put their own safety and wellbeing in jeopardy” to ensure other key workers were able to get to work, and that medicines and other provisions could be transported.</p> \n  <p>He writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>These Covid heroes had the right to expect Labour, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/labour-party-cost-of-living-keir-starmer-striking-workers\">party of working people</a>, to stand with them and speak out against the war that the Tories have declared on them.</p> \n   <p>That’s why I stood on the picket line at Euston, with my friends and allies in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/rmt\">RMT</a> and TSSA transport unions, and why I gave media interviews in support of these workers.</p> \n   <p>That was my duty, as a shadow transport minister for the Labour party.

She is widely seen as having won a crunch television debate with Sunak. And she is more likely to be seen by key groups in the new Tory electorate —pensioners, Leavers, Boris Johnson’s 2019 voters— as being “in touch with ordinary people”, “holding similar views to my own”, and “trustworthy”. Given Tory members put a higher value on loyalty than Don Corleone this bodes well for Truss. The race, the country, is now hers to lose.</p> \n   <p>People overestimated Sunak and underestimated Truss. As a result, those who thought they Got Boris Done, by getting rid of the current Prime Minister, are about to be confronted with a Prime Minister who is more Johnson than Johnson and who —given her strong backing from committed Brexiteers— will assemble a cabinet that is more Brexit than Brexit.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>While Truss is popular with party members, the problem for Team Truss is whether the voters who will decide their fate at the next election share their instincts on many other crunch issues other than Brexit, Goodwin says.</p> \n  <p>He continues:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Do voters in the Red Wall <em>really </em>want to slash taxes, the state, and spending on public services?

And he did,” she recalled.</p> \n  <p>Watson, who has a novel coming out next year, told of how Johnson issued her own marching orders two weeks after Cummings’ departure from Downing Street in 2020, in the Cabinet Office room conversation which she believed “may have been familiar to many of his girlfriends”.</p> \n  <p>She wrote that Johnson had told her: “I can’t look at you any more because it reminds me of Dom.

He allegedly ordered them to publish pro-Russian lies and coordinated actions by them intended to further Russian interests.</p> <p>The department also claimed Ionov influenced a US political group in Florida under his control to interfere in local elections, supporting the St Petersburg, Florida, political campaigns of two people in 2017 and 2019. It listed the group and individuals as “unindicted co-conspirators” but did not name them.</p> <p>From at least December 2014 to March 2022, the department said, Ionov and at least three other Russian officials engaged in a malign foreign influence campaign targeting the US.</p> <p>Separately, the US treasury department on Friday imposed sanctions on Ionov, his fellow Russian national Natalya Valeryevna Burlinova, and four Russian entities it accused of backing the Kremlin’s mission of interfering in elections abroad, including in the US and Ukraine.</p> <p>According to the justice department, the four entities in question are: the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia (AGMR), which Ionov founded and presides over; Ionov Transkontinental; Stop-Imperialism; and the Center for Support and Development of Public Initiative Creative Diplomacy (Picreadi).</p> <p>The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on the indictment or the US sanctions, which among other things block the property in American jurisdiction of those named.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed this report</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/jul/29/trump-jan-6-manchin-biden-covid-boosters-us-politics-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T20:03:20Z","webTitle":"DoJ reportedly preparing court fight to get Trump insiders to testify – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/jul/29/trump-jan-6-manchin-biden-covid-boosters-us-politics-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/jul/29/trump-jan-6-manchin-biden-covid-boosters-us-politics-latest","fields":{"headline":"DoJ reportedly preparing court fight to get Trump insiders to testify – as it happened","trailText":"Prosecutors expect former president to try to invoke executive privilege to prevent his ex-officials from speaking","byline":"Richard Luscombe","body":"<div id=\"block-62e43a648f08730a1f7f3f5a\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T20:03:20.179Z\">9.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We’re closing the blog now at the end of a momentous week in US politics, with the landmark climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act set to become a big win for <strong>Joe Biden</strong> ahead of the midterm elections.</p> <p>Here’s what else we followed:</p> <ul> <li>The US will not allow any further Russian annexation in Ukraine to go “unchallenged or unpunished”, White House press secretary <strong>Karine Jean-Pierre</strong> said, following secretary of state <strong>Antony Blinken</strong>’s conversation with Russian foreign minister <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong> earlier in which he pressed his Kremlin counterpart over negotiations to release jailed Americans <strong>Brittney Griner</strong> and <strong>Paul Whelan</strong>. </li> <li>Justice department prosecutors are readying for a likely court fight to get testimony from <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s former White House officials over his illegitimate actions to overturn his 2020 election defeat.

<p>According to the report, compiled with the help several people familiar with private conversations, and granted anonymity to discuss them, Manchin met Schumer secretly in a Capitol basement to get the conversation going.</p> <p>“What a beautiful office,” Schumer reportedly said. “Is it mine?”<br></p> <p>Over several sessions, the two men and their staffs <a

bill becomes law remains to be seen.

The journey to the final four at the Euros in 2017 and Women’s World Cup in 2019 similarly lifted the profile of women’s football and the women’s national team. This time though, something else is happening, the tournament has penetrated public consciousness like never before and the conversation is changing. People aren’t talking about women’s football; they’re talking about football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/battle-for-the-golden-boot-mead-and-popp-have-dual-goals-in-their-sights\">Battle for the Golden Boot: Mead and Popp have dual goals in their sights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“What is the legacy?” asks Ian Wright, who oozes passion for the women’s game. “It’s normalising the conversation. I’m hearing people talking about the football. It’s normal, it’s just football. That’s why I love it, I love women’s football because I love football.</p> <p>“We don’t need to worry about the dinosaurs,” he adds. “I saw someone say something about the dinosaurs screaming at the meteor, I love it, that’s what those negative people are. See how many millions of people have been watching these women play, there’s people out there for this game.”</p> <p>Former England international Rachel Yankey has been at the BoxPark fan venue in Wembley for every game, watching the support for the team swell with each game, each staggering performance.</p> <p>“We’ve always known, every England team that I’ve played for has always known, that if you get to that final, if you can win it, you’ve got the opportunity to change people’s perceptions. That’s what this group has done.”</p> <p>The last time England’s women’s team reached the final of a major competition, striker Kelly Smith was in the starting line-up to suffer a 6-2 defeat to Germany.</p> <p>“When I played, nobody knew there was a Euros final, in 2009, because there was no TV coverage up until the semi-final and then they saw us lose the final. Now, we know the journey of the players from the opening game. The nation has fallen in love with the Lionesses, which is something I never thought would happen,” she says.</p> <p>“The broader general public knows that this tournament is going on. It’s just captivated the whole country. We saw it at the men’s Euros last year, they got to the final and made people fall in love with the men’s team again.</p> <p>“I’m not Mystic Meg, in terms of what’s going to happen in the final, but it’s just really daunting to think that if they can do this, win the first major trophy since the World Cup in 1966, it sets standards for where the team is and where the game can potentially go. The sky’s the limit now.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c375193d8247bb404be3da49f88c8244de902e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c375193d8247bb404be3da49f88c8244de902e9/0_0_5520_3884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The England players prepare for the final at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The England players prepare for the final at Wembley. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The FA’s director of women’s football, Sue Campbell, who was chairman of UK Sport for the 2012 Olympics, did not think she would feel the way she did 10 years ago again.</p> <p>“I never thought I would feel this level of happiness, enjoyment and sense of pride in our country in our team,” Lady Campbell says. “On Wednesday night, I felt it so deeply. I stood there for virtually an hour after the game had finished and the players were still on the pitch and the crowd was still rocking. It was just an extraordinary evening, an extraordinary moment. Am I surprised? I think this country loves sport and loves success in sport and yes, it has surprised me to some extent but as we’ve started to win, the momentum has just been incredible.”</p> <p>The impact of the country falling in love with the Lionesses is where their journey diverges from that of the men’s team last summer, because there is the potential for it to shift the narrative around the involvement of women and girls in sport at every level, to shift attitudes in society far beyond skyrocketing the development of the women’s game.</p> <p>The broadcaster Clare Balding says: “Being able to see women being confident and ambitious, these all being positive attributes, and taking risks and being prepared to fail and playing without fear and playing for each other - that’s such a strong and massive message beyond the field of play. And of course, the field of play matters, that’s why they’re all doing it and that’s what this is about, but you can’t underestimate that greater impact.”</p> <p>In terms of the development of women’s football, the Euros is shaping up to be a tournament that will “turbo charge” its growth, according to Campbell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/this-is-the-opportunity-for-england-to-change-the-womens-game-forever\">This is the opportunity for England to change the women’s game forever | Karen Carney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It will move the agenda on so much more quickly than we could have done without it. It will just drive it at a different pace,” says Campbell.</p> <p>The key is whether the FA and clubs can capitalise on the moment, bottle it, and keep it alive.</p> <p>“It sounds weird,” says Yankey. “Of course the football comes first, but in my mind it sort of comes second. As much as I want to watch the game, I more just want to embrace the atmosphere and the crowd. I don’t remember too much about the football at the Olympics in 2012, but I remember staring out the window at Wembley looking at people queuing up to go on the train home and just thinking: ‘I can’t believe this’. After that, nothing really happened. So, if nothing happens this time then there’s a massive problem with everything, with how we run women’s football, how we view women’s football and it’s all been wrong. It has to change. There has to be a legacy after this.”</p> <p>There are already signs of the demand. Manchester United defender Aoife Mannion has been helping a club looking to set up a girl’s team for the new season in the village near where she lives. Ahead of England’s quarter-final defeat of Spain she went into a primary school and spoke to the kids about the game and their ambitions for a team locally.</p> <p>She wasn’t sure of the impact, she didn’t know how to gauge the reaction of the kids, but the uptake has been huge. “The chairman of the little village football team was just totally shocked by how much he was inundated by parents filling in registration forms to say that their daughters wanted to play,” she says.</p> <p>“Originally, when I tweeted about it, it looked like we were going to start three teams but now there’s talk of six teams. When I was their age there was no local girls’ team that I knew of when I was starting out. I lived in a town rather than a village. That a direct effect of this tournament is that several teams could be created in a tiny, tiny little village, one of several villages surrounding a small town in Cheshire, is just beyond what anyone could have imagined.”</p> <p>Helping prompt the huge shift in the momentum of the tournament and support for the team has been the impressive BBC coverage. “When I went into that school and I said ‘watch it tonight on BBC’, everyone knows what that means and there’s no barrier to entry. That accessibility really, really matters. We try to sell football as something that is meant to be really inclusive and so this tournament being shown on the BBC really makes that become real for everyone.”</p> <p>Campbell adds: “It’s priceless. You couldn’t put a number on it.”</p> <p>Hope Powell, the pioneering coach who led England for 15 years until 2013, says: “Even in the space of a few weeks, since the tournament started, we’ve seen the positive impact it’s had on women’s football in this country. Making sure we keep that going by driving standards in the WSL [Women’s Super League] and giving opportunities to as many girls and women to play the game is the best legacy from these Euros, and I do feel that momentum is building now. I’m proud of the part I played as a player and coach but it’s Sarina and her squad’s time now and I can’t wait to be at Wembley on Sunday and hopefully see us lift the trophy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Building on grassroots access to the game is key.

But the trouble is that to do that you need investment in sport in schools more generally.</p> <p>“There is serial under-investment in sports in schools. You only have to look at the levels of obesity, the levels of mental health issues, there are so many factors and I’m not saying it would all be cured if they had sports, but, my god, it would help. The dissociation of sports with academic work with schoolwork is really damaging. Because actually, if you can focus and take decisions at pace, and work with team members you’re picking up are life skills. This isn’t just about playing football. And that’s where I think the difference has got to be made.”</p> <p>Campbell says: “We have a very clear strategy for what we’re trying to do. So many of the things that we wanted to see and have articulated in that strategy we are now actually seeing come to life.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/30/saudi-sisters-found-dead-in-sydney-had-active-claims-for-asylum-with-department-of-home-affairs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T20:00:07Z","webTitle":"Saudi sisters found dead in Sydney had active claims for asylum with Department of Home Affairs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/30/saudi-sisters-found-dead-in-sydney-had-active-claims-for-asylum-with-department-of-home-affairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/30/saudi-sisters-found-dead-in-sydney-had-active-claims-for-asylum-with-department-of-home-affairs","fields":{"headline":"Saudi sisters found dead in Sydney had active claims for asylum with Department of Home Affairs","trailText":"Asra Abdullah Alsehli, 24, and Amaal Abdullah Alsehli, 23, were quiet and ‘would keep to themselves’, former landlord says","byline":"Mostafa Rachwani and Ben Doherty","body":"<p>Two Saudi sisters found dead in their beds in Sydney last month lived reclusive lives over years in Australia: the women had few friends, almost no visitors, and “would only leave the house here and there”, according to a former landlord.</p> <p>Guardian Australia has confirmed Asra Abdullah Alsehli, 24, and Amaal Abdullah Alsehli, 23, were asylum seekers: each had an active claim for asylum ongoing with the Department of Home Affairs and had engaged with settlement services providers in Sydney.

Dreamworld, nor its impact on marsupials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/koala-listed-as-endangered-after-australian-governments-fail-to-halt-its-decline\">recently

shows that more than 90,000 hectares of likely koala habitat was cleared under the Vegetation Management Act is the real disaster,” Copeman said. “Not a koala tourism facility not being built.”</p> <p>That description appears a far cry from how it was spruiked back in March 2019, when the then assistant tourism industry development minister, Meaghan Scanlon, trumpeted what she said would be Queensland’s first native animal genome research facility.</p> <p>“The Dreamworld Future Lab will be a world-class research facility and will allow us to deploy experts to tackle some of the biggest issues facing our native wildlife – like the threat of chlamydia on the local koala population,” Scanlon said at that time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p>

was built with $2.7m tagged for koala research, government says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than three years later when Scanlon – now the state’s environment minister – faced a grilling from her opposition counterpart, Sam O’Connor, at budget estimates on Friday afternoon, Scanlon’s description of Dreamworld facility sounded much more aligned to Copeman’s.</p> <p>“To be clear this matter falls entirely in the Department of Tourism and Industry development,” Scanlon said.</p> <p>“It would be entirely inappropriate to transfer money from the Department of Environment and Science to a theme park.”</p> <p>That line was backed by a government spokesperson, who told the Guardian that the Future Lab’s “primary purpose was to attract tourists from Asia”.</p> <p>“The original concept was meant to attract overseas visitors from the Asian tourism market but global international travel bans during Covid meant that was pointless,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>They added there “were of course added benefits that aligned with the government’s priorities of preserving Queensland’s koala population”.</p> <p>The deputy director of the University of the Sunshine Coast’s Genecology Research Centre, Prof Peter Timms, has been leading the fight against koala chlamydia.</p> <p>Though he was never involved in the Dreamworld Lab – which was to partner with the University of Queensland – he said it is “always disappointing” to see money diverted from any conservation research.</p> <p>“But I’m not sure it was the end of the world because it’s a complex process, saving koalas, and trees are what matters most,” he said. “And we keep knocking them down.”</p> <p>But while land clearing is the number threat to koalas, he said that chlamydia is driving previously stable populations into decline.</p> <p>And Timms has a solution that could make “a huge difference” to the fate of the koala: a chlamydia vaccine.</p> <p>Timms said his team has developed a vaccine that is ready for production and is lobbying for $2.5m in government funds to roll it out nationally – $200,000 less than what was given towards the Steel Taipan rollercoaster.</p> <p>But the Dreamworld Future Lab may yet see the light of day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

the Steel Taipan, a better magnet for domestic tourists.</p> <p>Now that “international travel is back”, tourism officials have “reached out to Dreamworld to gauge their interest in restarting discussions about revisiting the koala research centre”.</p> <p>Timms said that, if flying international tourists to hold koalas at tourist attractions helps the marsupials, “it doesn’t do it directly”.</p> <p>“And that’s OK,” he said. “As long as you don’t misrepresent it.”</p> <p>Copeman has his own suggestion for boosting tourism revenue.</p> <p>If we want tourists to be able to come and see koalas, then we’re going to need to address the main driver in the loss of the species: habitat loss.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/30/a-female-focus-and-short-shortlists-the-long-road-taken-to-fill-nsws-new-york-trade-role","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia

It raises an interesting subplot: was Ayres, who previously said he knew Barilaro might apply for the job because the former deputy premier told him via text message in December, actually trying to block his candidacy?</p> <p>Ayres himself said during a press conference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/30/do-the-honourable-thing-nsw-minister-tells-john-barilaro-to-withdraw-from-new-york-job\">last month</a> that he “had some concerns” Barilaro’s candidacy could “create some political contention”.</p> <p>“I think I can say to everyone here, I’m hardly known as the flag bearer of the John Barilaro fan club, but he’s a private citizen and we’ve got to be able to make sure that any private citizen who applies for a role gets a fair hearing,” he said at the time.</p> <p>But at the same press conference, Ayres also said that “politicians have not played any role in the selection and recruitment process” of the New York trade role, and that any attempt on his part to direct the public service over hiring would have amounted to “undue influence”.</p> <p>Ayres has continued to deny he influenced the process.

A number of senior ministers within the government are furious that the saga shows no sign of letting up, with further hearings of the parliamentary inquiry probing the posting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/date-set-for-john-barilaro-to-appear-at-inquiry-into-new-york-trade-job\">to be held next week</a>. Barilaro himself is due to appear on 8 August.</p> <p>The Labor opposition’s refusal to call for Ayres’ resignation similarly suggests there is no appetite on their part to bring to a close a saga which has completely derailed the government’s agenda less than a year out from the next election.</p> <p>As shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, said on Thursday: “Our preferred remedy here isn’t just to get rid of Stuart Ayres.

For a contact in (sic) mine who hasn’t applied for the role, but might consider it if it came around AGAIN!” she wrote.</p> <p>Then on 28 May, an email from the head of the recruitment firm tasked with headhunting for the role sent Brown an email containing reference reports for “the top two candidates” for the job: Barilaro and Cole. “As discussed,” the recruiter wrote.</p> <p>Investment NSW did not respond to questions about the email, but those dates – well after Perrottet was told of Barilaro’s appointment on 30 April – will be of keen interest to the committee, as will another email, sent on 29 September, stating there was still a “preferred candidate” for the job prior to the second recruitment process commencing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/date-set-for-john-barilaro-to-appear-at-inquiry-into-new-york-trade-job\">Date set for John Barilaro to appear at inquiry into New York trade job</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To understand its significance, you need to go back to the woman who almost did get the job.

There’s a lot of attachment.”</p> <p>Baumann, an economist and course director of the university’s bachelor of marketing and media course, says there is a century of “brand equity” in Qantas.</p> <p>That buildup of fondness and high expectations means that, when Qantas fails, it hits hard. Baumann says when people are flying Jetstar, they’re just happy to get a free coffee. But the bar is much higher with the national carrier. When it fails, they don’t just feel disappointed; they feel betrayed.</p> <p>“With these issues with the luggage, with flights being cancelled … passengers will be forgiving if it’s the weather,” he says.</p> <p>“But if they think it’s at least in part due to mismanagement, they blame the brand that they know.”</p> <p>That historical equity, he says, also means it will all even out. </p> <p>“People are upset in the moment,” but have short-term memories, he says. “In six months they’ll book again.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BradM_Optimum/status/1549999966688788481\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sitting in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Qantas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Qantas</a> lounge in Melbourne now.

In an interview on the Sydney radio station 2GB, senior manager Andrew David acknowledged the airline had let customers down.</p> <p>“We are the national carrier – people have high expectations of us, we have high expectations of ourselves – and clearly over the last few months we have not been delivering what we did pre-Covid,” <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/we-have-not-been-delivering-qantas-apologises-to-frustrated/2txcdgv6o\">he said</a>.</p> <p>In a separate statement earlier this month, he said some criticism was fair, but some of the problems were global.</p> <p>Restarting the airline after it was grounded by the pandemic was complex, he said. A tight labour market and rising Covid cases were the headwinds, not the baggage handler outsourcing. Qantas was now recruiting staff and cutting flights.</p> <p>“Given Covid and flu will be ongoing, there will be a few more bumps along the way,” he said.</p> <p>“But over the weeks and months ahead, flying will get back to being as smooth as it used to be.”</p> <p>Phillip Adams wants his slogan back.

There’s no ‘glam squad’ touching up your makeup in the middle of a battle.”</p> <p>In episode one, Stone presented the judges with a lamb arepa served under a glass dome filled with smoke. “I was clearly a little nervous as I was carrying it up. You can hear the cloches shaking in my hand! You’ve got to hold the plates perfectly still, walk across the room and describe something without huffing and puffing.”</p> <p>Time pressure is also an issue for the people behind the cameras. Producer and director Lin Jie Kong travelled around Australia with comedian Jennifer Wong, visiting regional Chinese restaurants for ABC’s Chopsticks or Fork?</p> <p>“Our show was different to those where everything is beautifully stylised and they’re in a controlled environment with a crew of 20.

You only have minutes to get the shot where you see steam rising or the broth glistening and before sauces start congealing.”</p> <p>Small and awkward kitchens also presented a physical challenge. “I’m not that tall and a lot of the workstations are high and the woks are deep. To film inside the woks, I’d have to raise the camera really high above my head, which is quite difficult, especially if they’re stir frying for five minutes and I’m trying to get that slow-motion stir-fry shot.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jul/25/we-just-dont-get-visited-why-australia-is-overlooked-in-worlds-best-restaurant-rankings\">‘We just don’t get visited’: why Australia is overlooked in world’s best restaurant rankings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Iron Chef is big budget and plentifully resourced, with, reports Stone, an art department that makes everything “big and beautiful”. There’s a culinary team, too. “If you ask for a rotisserie with a live fire bed, they just roll one in. Or you say: ‘I need an inversion circulator’ and they hand you one.”</p> <p>But while a big budget expands creative possibilities on both sides of the camera, it can’t do a thing about the ticking clock. “Iron Chef is similar to a restaurant where your guests arrive, they sit down and order and you have 15 minutes to get them an appetiser before they get restless.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b267e1182e7c14eb15e549c1db028e2af2bcef4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b267e1182e7c14eb15e549c1db028e2af2bcef4e/0_0_2800_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet and Sour Barramundi at Happy Garden in Darwin, on ABC’s Chopsticks or Forks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kong found stir-fries – a staple of Chinese cooking – were not naturally photogenic, because ‘they’re saucy and flat’.

You are constantly creating dishes in your mind while making sure that it’s all coming together on the plate,” Stone says. “There’s cameras everywhere, producers asking you questions, you’re worried about what the other team is doing, you have sous chefs to keep an eye on … That 60 minutes flashes by, then you think, ‘Oh my God, what did I serve?’”</p> <p>For non-competitive shows, organisation minimises the risk of on-set disasters. Nichols describes the Cook Up as “a military operation”.</p> <p>“All the refrigeration, storage and cleaning is kept like a commercial kitchen. On set, it’s all about being prepared for any last-minute problems and having a sense of how to cook food and knowing how it will react.</p> <p>“Anything that melts, solidifies or is structurally unsound is challenging!”</p> <p>There are other constraints too. “The studio lighting is quite harsh, so you have to think about pastry under hot lamps or the food props at the back of set that sit out all day,” Nicholas says. “When you work with cream, you put the bowls in the fridge before you whip it so that it can last longer. With ice-cream – ice-cream’s a disaster! – you need dry ice, freezers and extra scoops on hand.”</p> <p>While working on Chopsticks or Fork, Kong found that stir-fries – a staple of Chinese cooking – were not naturally photogenic, because “they’re saucy and flat”. She worked hard to find their beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e7f6ce1a9d081258c024c12acbca285cd831acb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e7f6ce1a9d081258c024c12acbca285cd831acb/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salt and pepper squid at New Bo Wa in Moree, NSW\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salt and pepper squid at New Bo Wa in Moree, NSW which Kong says ‘looked gorgeous’ in the afternoon light.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“If you get something like Mongolian lamb, it usually comes on a sizzling hot plate and you get the extra texture and steam off the top.</p> <p>“There was a salt and pepper squid dish we shot which I think looked gorgeous. There was height in the dish, garnishes and a beautiful afternoon light coming through the window.”</p> <p>So the magic ingredients for making food look beautiful aren’t magic at all – just preparation, hard work, food knowledge, passion and staying cool under pressure.</p> <p>Kong also cites another influence on what audiences see.</p> <p>“We can talk about how to plan the shots, but there’s more to it than that,” she says, reflecting on the people she met throughout filming the series. “How we tell a story and what you see on screen is influenced by all of our individual backgrounds. Food is such a vehicle for love and emotion … I hope that we were able to capture that connection in how we shot the food.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/29/bowls-boxing-basketball-birminghams-bonanza-of-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T20:00:06Z","webTitle":"Bowls, boxing, basketball: Birmingham’s bonanza of sport","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/bowls-boxing-basketball-birminghams-bonanza-of-sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/29/bowls-boxing-basketball-birminghams-bonanza-of-sport","fields":{"headline":"Bowls, boxing, basketball: Birmingham’s bonanza of sport","trailText":"The start of the Commonwealth Games was blessed with warm weather, but some commuters were not impressed","byline":"Andy Bull in Royal Leamington Spa and Birmingham","body":"<p>“Ten, nine, eight, no wait, I’ve got ahead of myself, nine, eight, seven…” The Birmingham Commonwealth Games began with this out-of-synch countdown in (and yes I had to triple check this) Royal Leamington Spa, where, at just gone eight on Friday morning, 80 finely-honed athletes filed out of a little wooden pavilion in Victoria Park to begin the first of nine days of ruthlessly competitive lawn bowls. Friendly Games my foot. Go tell it to Wales’ five-time world champion Laura Daniels, who wiped out a 59-year-old Falkland Islander called Daphne Arthur-Almond 21-2 while you were finishing your breakfast.</p> <p>God but they must have spent a lot on bunting in Leamington. They’ve put up miles of the stuff. It’s amazing they’d anything left in the budget for the 2,000 seat arena they’ve built too. Nigel Huddleston, under-suit of state at Department of Culture Media and Sport, had promised the town it was money well spent because they were going to be hosting one of the hot ticket events.

Here in Leamington they had come in their dozens, and from as far away as Solihull and Smethwick. The MC hosting the event did well to find a couple of paying spectators to interview on the big screen. “We wanted to go for something less popular,” one of them explained. There was an awkward silence, which the director filled by cutting away to a shot of the in-house DJ. Thankfully, they faded him down and the actual bowls was, somewhat oddly, soundtracked by a selection of classic rock tracks played on a plaintive violin.</p> <p>There were 19 games going on, so soon enough the place was filled with the rustle and thrum of cutthroat sport being played very, very quietly, all clacking woods and jacks and muted cries of “c’mon, c’mon” and “move, move, move”. A lot of the noise was coming from rink 7, where Scotland beat England in the first round of the para men’s pairs B6-B8. This was being played in front of two groups of rival administrators, presumably the great and good of UK bowls, and their comments (“C’mon Kevin!” and “Great shot Craig!”) seemed to be aimed as much at each other as they were the men in the middle.</p> <p>But the fun of the Commonwealth Games is in following the underdogs, and I was drawn irresistibly to rink 3 where Shae Wilson, a 22-year-old from Norfolk Island, beat the 59-year-old Litia Tikoisuva from Fiji. Apparently there are 2,186 people on Norfolk Island, and eleven of them are competing here in Leamington. Lawn bowls must be big on the little island because that’s 0.5% of the entire population, and they haven’t bothered entering any other events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf13200e6bb1da55de1aeec8e63374b3fac838a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf13200e6bb1da55de1aeec8e63374b3fac838a1/0_123_4440_2665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Haaris Khan (left) and Lewis Richardson in their middleweight contest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Haaris Khan (left) and Lewis Richardson in their middleweight contest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similar percentage of Leamington’s residents seemed to be at the station waiting for the 11.15am back into town. As part of their efforts to make this an environmentally friendly games the organisers are urging everyone on to the existing trains and buses, a well-intentioned plan which places a parlous degree of faith in the precarious public transport system. By late morning it was standing room only, unless, like the family of four who pressed in next to me, you were lucky enough to bag a seat in one of the toilet cubicles. “It’s those fucking Games isn’t it,” muttered one disgusted commuter as she elbowed her way aboard.</p> <p>Wherever they were off to it wasn’t Hall 4 of the NEC, where the men’s light welterweight boxing was just under way. The place was a quarter-full, although no doubt the crowds will pick up in the evenings.</p> <p>The price of defeat for the underdogs here was a little more severe than it had been in Leamington. The bowlers consoled themselves with ice lollies, the boxers with ice packs. Nauru’s light welterweight Colan Caleb had travelled for almost 35 hours to be in Birmingham, but had the misfortune to then be drawn against the marvellously-monikered Jonas Junias Jonas, the defending champion from Namibia. So after all that travel Caleb’s Games ended in the two minutes it took the referee to decide it was time to stop the fight. “That was not a good test,” Jonas said afterwards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2022/jul/29/commonwealth-games-2022-day-one-in-pictures\">Commonwealth Games 2022: day one in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two minutes was good going in the circumstances.

The headline event here was another UK derby, Wales’ Haaris Khan against England’s Lewis Richardson, who won handily on points.</p> <p>Back in the centre of Birmingham, a shorter train ride this time, though just as busy, the Games was really underway at the 3x3 basketball arena in Smithfield. So this was where everyone was headed. Don’t tell the good people of Leamington, but the 3x3, which is making its debut at the Games, really is the hot ticket. The place is sold out all week. There were a couple of victories for England here, in the men’s and women’s wheelchair events, and another for Scotland’s men, although their women lost to Australia.

A few thoughts in response to that question.</p> \n<p>We are in a rebalancing point in the political cycle. These periods are fascinating because they don’t come around all that often. The old opposition, having won the election, is either remembering, or learning, how to be a government, and the old government is learning how to be an opposition.</p> \n<p>We are hearing a lot from Chalmers at the moment because events demand it, and because he’s learning how to be a treasurer. The fortysomething Queenslander doesn’t have the option of taking himself off-stage and practising somewhere in private. He has to learn how to do this job in front of us.</p> \n<p>When he was last in government, Chalmers was in the backroom, advising a treasurer managing the fallout from the global financial crisis. That was invaluable experience, but offering counsel and writing lines is different to delivering them.</p> \n<p>Like all of his predecessors in the portfolio, Chalmers brings his own personal and professional attributes to the job. His immediate predecessor, Josh Frydenberg – another staffer who transited to frontman – set great store on networked ubiquity, charm and message discipline.</p> \n<p> Chalmers, a confident communicator with a pedagogical inclination, leans on storytelling. His style of explanatory economics is clearly influenced by Labor’s most successful postwar period in government – the Hawke-Keating project. The maxim of that era was respect voters enough to tell them what’s going on; tell them why things are hard, or why they need to change, and then they might walk with you on the twisting path to sunny uplands.</p> \n<p>If the revised forecasts are correct, the upswing will come just as Labor prepares to fight the next election. But getting there requires navigating difficult cross currents now. This week’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/26/guardian-essential-poll-40-of-voters-say-labor-doing-poor-job-tackling-surging-cost-of-living\">Guardian Essential poll</a> suggested people’s patience battling a protracted cost of living storm won’t be infinite.</p> \n<p>Understanding the imperative of getting a grip on both the substance and the storytelling, Chalmers used this week’s economic statement as a dry run for the budget. </p> \n<p>He says the trying conditions we are all battling at the moment are attributable to two things: events outside Australia’s control, and the serial hopelessness of the Morrison government.</p> \n<p>All new governments blame their opponents for any bad news. The Coalition was still blaming Labor for things in their ninth year of office, which tells you the Liberal and National parties pursue legacy assassination with focus and vigour.</p> \n<p>They are generally much better at it than Labor. Labor tends to have a swing, and then wander off and focus on its own program, so it will be interesting to see whether this new government has sharpened the brutal politics of blame shifting.</p> \n<p>In any case, there’s a more important question – is Chalmers’ central charge of dereliction by the Morrison government a fair one?</p> \n<p>The answer is both absolutely, and not entirely.</p> \n<p>The Morrison government was the worst government I’ve covered, largely because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/21/after-the-relentless-performance-art-of-morrisons-reign-australia-needs-a-reset\">the hollowness of the enterprise</a>. It wasn’t tethered by an organising philosophy or values. It had scant interest in pursuing any national reform project that might encumber weaponised partisanship. The Liberals were also araldited to the Nationals, a post-governance party riven by personality cults and vicious factionalism.</p> \n<p>But Scott Morrison did have a good year as prime minister: 2020. Significant fiscal support was required to preserve lives and livelihoods, and minimise the risks of labour market scarring. Instead of being ideological or parsimonious on principle, as some Liberals would have been, Frydenberg and Morrison pinned their ears back, and spent the money. Not all the interventions were perfect, but lives, businesses and jobs were saved.</p> \n<p>That’s one (certainly not all) of the reasons why we’ve got some inflation and a whopping deficit now. But Chalmers has a tendency to blur the imperfect but necessary action in a crisis with all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/21/sports-rorts-coalition-approved-at-least-six-grants-without-an-application-form-documents-reveal\">the institutionalised “rorts and waste”</a> – the Coalition’s hard-wired habit of shovelling buckets of money out the door to shore up its re-election prospects in marginal seats.</p> \n<p>So the current blame-shift isn’t entirely fair. But the political objective is simple. In hard times, fortify your positions. If you can convict your opponents in the court of public opinion, you have a prospect of lengthening your own runway.</p> \n<p>The new government is clearly taking out political insurance as it walks the narrow path of trying to subdue inflation without catapulting the economy into recession.</p> \n<p>Separate to this, but related. The Reserve Bank is trekking alongside the government, trying to deliver the forecast soft landing. Anthony Albanese decided last week to publicly counsel the bank against “overreaching” with interest rate rises to subdue inflation. This intervention was highly unusual, given Australia’s central bank is supposed to be independent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2022/jul/27/how-will-labor-tackle-climate-change-and-cost-of-living-as-parliament-returns\">How will Labor tackle climate change and cost of living as parliament returns?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The overreach musing could have been a rookie error. But political strategy seems more likely on the balance of probabilities. In the event the hoped-for soft landing is harder than expected, apportioning blame will be an inevitable part of the wash-up.</p> \n<p>There will be a serious reckoning: who stuffed up, when, and why. Albanese hanging a lantern over potential overreach by the central bank seeds the zeitgeist. The prime minister is prompting voters: if there’s a miscalculation, understand the bank is here, making decisions, as well as the government.</p> \n<p>Chalmers’ methodology was so obvious that even Angus Taylor, the new shadow treasurer, tumbled to it. In response, Taylor said it was all very well for the new treasurer to be painting a picture and telling a story, but what the country needed was a plan.</p> \n<p>Stirring stuff, and Taylor has a valid point. A picture is different to a plan.</p> \n<p>But Taylor criticising anyone for lacking a plan is the stuff of standup comedy. </p> \n<p>A good part of the reason centre-right progressive voters turned their back on the Coalition on 21 May was because Taylor, then climate and energy minister, had no coherent plan to manage the climate crisis or the transition to low emissions.</p> \n<p>Taylor had a non-sequitur, “technology, not taxes” – a demonstrable nonsense given people’s taxes paid for the technology. No plan. No serious mechanism to drive abatement in the economy. A 2050 target that the government declined to legislate, because legislating anything would have blown up the Coalition.</p> \n<p>So, memo to Peter Dutton.</p> \n<p>If Taylor is your messenger, I strongly suspect the battle is already lost.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/jul/29/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T20:00:06Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/29/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/jul/29/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","trailText":"FH ‘Harry’ Hinsley | Bananarama | Circumlocution Office","byline":"Corrections and clarifications column editor","body":"<p>• During the second world war, the historian and cryptanalyst FH “Harry” Hinsley was involved with Bletchley Park, not the Special Operations Executive in Yugoslavia as editing changes led a tribute to suggest (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jun/19/mark-wheeler-obituary\" title=\"\">Other lives: Mark Wheeler</a>, 23 July, Journal, p10).</p> <p>• We should have credited Olivia Todd, not Karin Darnell, as the makeup artist for Bananarama in a photo feature (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/23/bananarama-sara-dallin-keren-woodward-look-back-roland-mouret\" title=\"\">Flashback</a>, 23 July, Saturday magazine, p10).</p> <p>• Abdulrazak Gurnah meant to say he was made to memorise the Circumlocution Office passage from Little Dorrit, not Bleak House (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/22/abdulrazak-gurnah-my-comfort-reading-is-cricket-reports\" title=\"\">The books of my life</a>, 23 July, Saturday magazine, p66).</p> <p>• Other recently amended articles include:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jul/28/frederick-barclay-could-face-jail-over-failed-payments-to-ex-wife\" title=\"\">Frederick Barclay could face jail over failed payments to ex-wife</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/ex-carillion-executives-face-1m-in-fines-over-market-abuse-claims\" title=\"\">Ex-Carillion executives face £1m in fines over ‘market abuse’ claims</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/14/feta-is-greek-rules-eu-court-denmark-told-stop-use-name\" title=\"\">Hard cheese: EU court scolds Denmark over feta labels in win for Greece</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/28/gb-news-faces-ofcom-investigation-host-mark-steyn-covid-booster-claims\" title=\"\">GB News faces Ofcom investigation over host’s Covid booster claims</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/29/tribunal-rulings-for-gender-critical-women-have-key-implications\" title=\"\">Tribunal rulings for gender-critical women have key implications</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/bernard-cribbins-obituary\" title=\"\">Bernard Cribbins obituary</a></p> <p><em>Editorial complaints and correction requests can be sent to: </em><a href=\"mailto:guardian.readers@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>guardian.readers@theguardian.com</em></a><em>.</em><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <p><em>You can also write to: Readers’ editor, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU, or leave a voicemail on +44 (0) 20 3353 4736.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/30/a-sex-worker-gave-my-autistic-son-the-gift-of-confidence-and-i-organised-the-encounter","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T20:00:06Z","webTitle":"A sex worker gave my autistic son the gift of confidence – and I organised the encounter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/30/a-sex-worker-gave-my-autistic-son-the-gift-of-confidence-and-i-organised-the-encounter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/30/a-sex-worker-gave-my-autistic-son-the-gift-of-confidence-and-i-organised-the-encounter","fields":{"headline":"A sex worker gave my autistic son the gift of confidence – and I organised the encounter","trailText":"Until he finds the right girl and a loving relationship, how better to channel his sexuality in a healthy way?","byline":"Anonymous","body":"<p>Parenting takes you on some interesting twists and turns, but as I lay in the maternity ward gazing into my newborn’s eyes, never in my wildest dreams could I ever have imagined that 21 years later I’d be trawling the websites of sex workers looking for a suitable young lady to take his virginity.

Teenage boys now have unfettered access to internet pornography, but – unlike my son – don’t confide their viewing habits to their mother, giving her the opportunity to correct misperceptions. There’s a danger in socially isolated autistic males, with their obsessive tendencies, being exposed to misogynistic porn. Already they are overrepresented among “incels” (involuntary celibates), who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/involuntary-celibates-incels-threat-us-secret-service\">known for their anti-women views</a>.</p> <p>So, when my son alluded to certain “activities” he’d obviously come across online, I was able to explain that, in real life, not all girls like that sort of thing. That good sex was about mutual caring and respect.</p> <p>I’d suggested the idea of a sex worker to him a couple of years ago when he had trouble getting past his first rejection, his first broken heart. Unfortunately, the pandemic intervened. Then, late last year, I attended a webinar on disability and sexuality.</p> <p>A male sex worker from <a href=\"https://www.touchingbase.org/\">Touching Base</a>, a Sydney-based charitable organisation that links up sex workers and people with a disability, answered questions, as well as a female worker called “Anna” who identified as neurodiverse. Touching Base’s vision aligns with that of <a href=\"https://pwd.org.au/sex-work-and-the-ndis-frequently-asked-questions/#:~:text=Every%20adult%2C%20with%20disability%20or,life%2C%20just%20like%20everyone%20else.\">People with Disability Australia</a>, which argues that “people with disability have a right to a sexual life, just like everyone else”.</p> <p>Feeling validated, I asked Touching Base to email me a list of suitable sex workers and summoned my son to look through the candidates.

Remembering is half the torment, the anticipatory terror. I think about how it feels to be mired in the long middle of an attack, those cruel hours when I ache for oblivion. The boredom of it. The fury. To be stuck in that hell-space indefinitely would be a slow-motion death of the soul. “Two things happened,” Mol writes of his ordeal. “I became a writer who no longer wrote, and a person who could no longer communicate with the modern world. In literature, and life, I began to disappear.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59a4540779aa0b93b80eff2ee9cbaa4e1cc6cbe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59a4540779aa0b93b80eff2ee9cbaa4e1cc6cbe8/0_0_4358_5447/800.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Mol\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I had never met a more diverse group of people in my life’: Oliver Mol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Train Lord is not a tale of recovery – of pain vanquished and a self triumphantly restored – but a story of tentative repair. A self remade. As Mol emerged from his migraine, alienated from his vocation and his body, he took a job as a train guard. “I had never met a more diverse group of people in my life,” he tells me, “all different nationalities, all different professions. There were doctors, pilots, taxi drivers, fast food attendants. There were people as young as 18 who’d just come out of high school and hoped they could make a buck. And there were people as old as 84. We all came to it for our own reasons.” On his first shift, there was a suicide. The railway, Mol learned, was a place of reckoning as well as refuge. He found both.</p> <p> It was on the trains that Mol made his way back, ever so slowly, to storytelling. First he started slipping jokes into his passenger announcements (“Next stop is Como, I’d say, named after the Holden Commo-dore”); then he used the two- to three-minute gaps between stations to sketch out fragments on the back of train timetables – just a sentence or two. Those fragments became short monologues that Mol performed in the attic bedroom of his share-house for friends; then a one-man show at the Adelaide fringe festival. Now there’s Train Lord: a memoir in essays. A fragmented whole.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Weekend app embed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>When Mol talks about his book – his hard-won, beautiful book – the analogy he uses isn’t locomotive but planetary. “I kind of imagined that the migraine was like a sun and that each one of my chapters would be a planet, and the planets would all be at different distances and offer different reflections. They’d each reflect back a kind of a truth.” The analogy that occurs to me is bodily – that Train Lord mimics how it feels to be in pain: loops and whorls of thought, ruminations and recursions. The heightened attentiveness and affect of a mind on fire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/09/can-migraines-be-untangled-by-new-medical-thinking\">Can migraines be untangled by new medical thinking?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Train Lord, Mol joins a growing fraternity of Aussie writers – including Lech Blaine, Michael Winkler and Michael Mohammed Ahmad – who are rattling the well-soldered cultural cage of manhood. “I would be lying if I said that it was my intention to write about masculinity,” Mol admits. “I just wasn’t. I was trying to understand myself. But, as you work through that, other people’s stories start to become intermingled with yours, and it becomes very apparent very quickly that there’s something abjectly terrible happening.”</p> <p>He tells me about the men who’d come to see his one-man show – these grizzled old blokes in their 50s and 60s – and how they’d wait for him afterwards so they could quietly share stories they’d never felt they could tell anyone else. And of his own father, and how it took the mighty wrench of the migraine – the forced vulnerability of it – for them to find a language through which to communicate.</p> <p>As Mol wrote Train Lord he was haunted by an image: “I felt like there was a tiny Oliver, who was not exactly me (but was more or less me), who existed in a storytelling world.

We talk about Mol’s literary heroes and mentors – Roberto Bolaño, Alejandro Zambra, Scott McClanahan, Amanda Lohrey – and the wild necessity of hope (“My book wouldn’t have worked if it wasn’t a book of hope”). We talk about the fine line that exists between romanticising, patronising and honouring working-class Australia, and the democratising linearity of train travel. We talk about the cringing shame Mol feels about his first book (“I was extremely young and terribly ambitious”), and the humility he feels about his second. And we talk about love.</p> <p>“This is a love story,” Mol writes in Train Lord. “I fell in love with writing, and then I stopped. I’m trying to figure out if I can fall in love again.”</p> <p>I ask him if he’s figured it out.

She started with four properties and expected it to stay small-scale – a semi-retirement plan.</p> <p>But after discovering a strong demand for her services, Bees Knees Holiday Rental and Property Services quickly expanded. Even throughout the closed-borders period of the pandemic, the number of places Lawson managed doubled. Partly because a “lot of properties were bought by southerners, which we’ve taken on for them”, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"06d8f530624449362733037075e4ee5c81f6a8a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06d8f530624449362733037075e4ee5c81f6a8a9/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Port Douglas from the air\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Port Douglas from the air.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Adams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today Bees Knees manages nearly 40 Airbnb properties in the Port Douglas area, and Lawson offers everything an absent Airbnb landlord can’t – from property maintenance to passing on travel tips to guests. She employs an assistant and contracts out work to local cleaners, a linen hire company, an electrician, an air-conditioning servicer, a plumber, and two maintenance workers. She places regular orders for tea, coffee and other household products. “We try and keep everything local,” she says.</p> <p>But now she’s struggling to find staff who can afford to live close enough to help look after the properties.</p> <p>Airbnb arrived in Australia in 2012, and, since then, millions of international and domestic travellers have booked stays through the platform. It has brought with it a series of profound shifts; from a new willingness to do business with strangers over the internet and sleep in someone else’s bed, to giving anyone the ability to live like a local in someone else’s town. But it has also raised questions about the benefits of booming short-term accommodation, when locals have nowhere to live.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5e9df9e8a80c459c55dc06ba6d86a7140cb346e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5e9df9e8a80c459c55dc06ba6d86a7140cb346e/144_0_4856_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Airbnb logo on a smartphone in front of a laptop showing its website\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of thousands of Australian property owners have earned money through the platform.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rise of “micro entrepreneurs”, like Lawson, is one outcome of this decade’s meteoric rise of digital platforms including Uber, Airtasker and Airbnb – known as the sharing economy – according to Dr Thomas Sigler, an economic and urban geographer from the University of Queensland. “I think a lot of people vilify Airbnb and similar companies and think of them as exploitative … but there’s also the idea that it does empower people,” he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Airbnb has sold us a product we didn’t know we were looking for</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Nicole Gurran</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hundreds of thousands of Australian property owners have earned money on the platform. Research by Sigler and his colleagues at UQ shows that between 2016 and 2019, nearly 350,000 properties were listed at least once, with an average growth in listings of 2.43% a month. But the closed borders of the pandemic, Sigler says, slashed listings.</p> <p>Last year Prof Sara Dolnicar, a UQ tourism researcher, forecast that “coronavirus had disrupted the disrupter” – that property investors would put their properties on the long-term market “and never return to Airbnb”.</p> <p>Now, she says: “I was wrong. Where money can be made, everybody is flocking back into the short-term market.”</p> <p>Airbnb has fundamentally changed how and where we travel. We make the bookings ourselves, rely on guest reviews instead of hotel star ratings, and collect keys not for a single room with a mini bar, but an entire house with bedrooms, a kitchen, even a lightly stocked pantry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3731f299bb319e4ea42dd962c66f3963725f6686\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3731f299bb319e4ea42dd962c66f3963725f6686/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bedroom looking out over the ocean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Any home in an attractive destination can be transformed into tourist accommodation overnight.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Greig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Nicole Gurran, a professor of urban and regional planning at University of Sydney, the company’s “phenomenal marketing campaign” has transformed the “geography” of tourism. While once we looked for accommodation in well-established tourist zones, now the market is almost infinite.</p> <p>“It means any home in an attractive destination can be transformed into tourist accommodation overnight, as opposed to the time and the cost and the regulatory approvals that traditional tourism accommodation like hotels have faced,” Gurran says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/11/short-term-rentals-long-term-anguish-for-australian-towns-struggling-to-find-homes-for-locals\">Short-term rentals, long-term anguish for Australian towns struggling to find homes for locals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Residential neighbourhoods and villages are now accessible destinations – with the promise of a more “authentic” travel experience. </p> <p>“With the idea that you go to a tourist destination and live where the locals live, I dare say Airbnb has sold us a product we didn’t know we were looking for,” says Gurran, whose (pre-pandemic) research demonstrated the extraordinary inroads Airbnb has made into popular destinations. For example, in Byron Bay, 17.6% of the entire housing stock is listed on Airbnb – equivalent to nearly half the town’s rental accommodation. “The irony is that locals can now barely live in many of those places,” she says.</p> <h2>From couch surfing to management companies</h2> <p>Airbnb has moved a long way from its original premise of the airbed in a spare room. (It was founded in 2008, after two flatmates in San Francisco rented out an air mattress on their living-room floor.) “What people fell in love with initially was very close to couch surfing,” Dolnicar says. “It was very personal, it was very connected, it was very local. Now that is not the case. Now it is just another accommodation provider.”</p> <p>Sigler’s analysis of Australian data shows that listings of entire homes has grown at a faster rate than shared accommodation, suggesting that it’s becoming more “professionalised” and that “increasingly, management companies rather than individuals are leasing properties full-time”. By definition, however, ‘entire home listings’ does not necessarily mean a property is leased year-round on Airbnb, and can include self-contained sections of larger properties.</p> <p>New research, as yet unpublished, by Sigler and his colleagues into the difference in rental return on short-term versus long-term rentals in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast shows why Airbnb is an attractive option for landlords; short-term rentals attract a relatively higher premium, one that increases when a property is larger and close to a city centre or beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"26fb2dc179b69d0bbd735a8920ae6c59f760dcd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26fb2dc179b69d0bbd735a8920ae6c59f760dcd3/0_0_5464_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surfers Paradise from the air\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gold Coast council was sued by a company that owned 70 properties after the council tried to increase rates on holiday lets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: shannonstent/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gurran says according to data from the independent data scraping service Inside Airbnb, the proportion of homes listed on Airbnb that are permanently reserved for holiday accommodation – as opposed to being hosted accommodation, in a home someone usually lives in – is more than a third.</p> <p>Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb manager for Australia and New Zealand, notes that the majority of properties are not listed year-round but rather on “an ad-hoc basis to help meet [hosts’] mortgage repayments, pay bills or save for their retirement”.</p> <p>Trish Burt, who runs Neighbours not Strangers, a lobby group that opposes short-term letting in residential areas, says she is in contact with people from all over Australia who face “a living hell” residing alongside holiday rentals: “You have no idea who is in your building, you have people mingling in corridors, you have people coming home drunk trying to get into your apartment, and you have people forced out of their living arrangements all together.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/11/weve-run-out-of-options-here-nsw-flood-disaster-worsens-housing-crisis-in-northern-rivers\">‘We’ve run out of options here’: NSW flood disaster worsens housing crisis in northern rivers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to Gurran, attempts to regulate the rise of Airbnb are widespread: “You look at New York, San Francisco, Dublin, Byron, Mornington … they have all had similar issues in terms of it consuming local housing stock and disturbing local residents … but all these jurisdictions have been forced into separate legal battles.” These are not legal battles that Airbnb always needs to fight, as they are frequently waged by property owners. In one case, the Gold Coast council was <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1d2f6bdd-4ea7-483c-a47d-1b73b071fdca\">sued by a company that owned 70 properties</a> after the council tried to increase rates on holiday lets.</p> <p>Right across Australia, though, driven primarily by local councils faced with growing housing insecurity and complaints from locals, attempts are under way to regulate short-term rentals. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/15/brisbane-to-charge-airbnb-hosts-higher-council-rates-to-tackle-housing-availability\">Brisbane city council has increased rates on these properties</a>, and Broome shire council is requiring them to register with local authorities. The New South Wales government has introduced a state planning policy that overrides local planning controls. It mandates a code of conduct and fire safety, and, in greater Sydney, limits unhosted listings to 180 days a year. Everywhere else in the state has no limits on the length of time a property can be rented out as an Airbnb, unless an exemption is granted. Byron Bay is negotiating for a 90-day cap.</p> <p>Burt says the NSW regulation will not address the primary issue of housing supply, and that the system prioritises investors over those who need a home: “The system has been flipped on its head.”</p> <h2>‘It’s snuck into all the residential areas’</h2> <p>In Port Douglas, where tourists are returning in droves, Lawson is having to put a cap on the amount of business she can take on. “We can’t get cleaners, because they’ve got nowhere to live,” she says. For the guests she does host, she has to warn them to book in early to local restaurants – many of which are operating on reduced hours, because the dire lack of permanent housing in the region means they can’t get staff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4669d6f89cab6a7ea683f3e4f1ac44ef72fcbe7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4669d6f89cab6a7ea683f3e4f1ac44ef72fcbe7d/0_0_5079_3391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four Mile beach at Port Douglas \" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four Mile beach at Port Douglas: ‘We’re now in a really difficult place where we just don’t have the accommodation for staff any more.’ <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>‘It’s disastrous – it really is,’ says the mayor, Michael Kerr, of the housing situation in Douglas shire.

Yeah, there’s no issue there at all. But it’s snuck into all the residential areas as well, which has become a real problem.

Closed borders meant the demand for short-term accommodation evaporated and housing stock returned to the long-term rental market. Now that borders are open and stock is flooding back to the short-term market, rental vacancy rates in many areas are plunging.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d0dc7a95ac3e685b1451e0d3567d2619e574274\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d0dc7a95ac3e685b1451e0d3567d2619e574274/0_0_5154_3436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Constitution Dock in Hobart, Tasmania\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Hobart, the removal of just 195 houses from the private rental market can move the rental vacancy rate from 2% to a perilous 1%.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott E Barbour/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A study by the University of Sydney into the impact of short-term rentals in Tasmania found that in Hobart, 47% of Airbnb short-term rental properties had a long-term rental market history. It found the removal of just 195 houses from the private rental market can move the rental vacancy rate from 2% to a perilous 1%.</p> <p>In regional areas, especially those impacted by shocks like bushfires that destroyed housing stock, it is even more acute. In Eurobodalla, on the south coast of NSW, where hundreds of homes were destroyed over the summer of 2019-20 and the rental vacancy rate is now at 1%, the mayor has written to about 8,000 holiday home owners in the shire asking them to rent their houses out long-term to combat a housing crisis he called “a social disaster of epic proportions”.</p> <p>In that market, says Gurran, “anything taken out for tourism is going to bite”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/23/the-not-for-profit-real-estate-agents-of-last-resort-aiming-to-disrupt-a-troubled-housing-market\">The not-for-profit real estate agents of last resort aiming to disrupt a troubled housing market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Airbnb’s Wheeldon says housing affordability is “a complex issue with a range of contributing factors such as population movements, the supply of new homes, the ratio of public housing, interest rates and broader economic conditions”.
