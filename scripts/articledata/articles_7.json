He took a few moments to regain his composure before continuing his evidence.</p> <p>He earlier told the court he was “confused and scared” after being accused of head-butting his girlfriend during a “tug of war” over a mobile phone.</p> <p>He said he did not deliberately head-butt Kate Greville and that they accidentally “clashed heads”.</p> <p>Giving evidence for a second day, Giggs said Greville had been trying to retrieve her phone from his pocket when they came face to face in his kitchen.</p> <p>“It got more and more aggressive. We were facing each other. It was a sort of tug of war and then we clashed heads,” he said. He said Greville fell backwards and that he could “quite clearly see that she was hurt”.</p> <p>Greville, 36, has told the trial that Giggs put both of his hands on her shoulders and head-butted her in the face.</p> <p>Giggs was asked how he felt when Greville accused him of head-butting her and said she would call the police. He said: “Confused and scared because now it looks like a situation where what happened was completely different and I was scared.”</p> <p>Giggs’s barrister, Chris Daw QC, asked the former Wales manager: “Did you at any stage put your hands on Kate’s shoulders and forcefully and deliberately head-butt her in the face?”</p> <p>“No, I didn’t,” said Giggs.</p> <p>“Would you ever do such a thing?” asked Daw. “No,” replied Giggs.</p> <p>The former Wales manager, 48, denies assaulting Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and the common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, at his home in Worsley on 1 November 2020.</p> <p>He also denies using controlling and coercive behaviour against Greville between August 2017 and November 2020.</p> <p>Giggs said the alleged head-butt happened after he and Greville had fallen out during an evening meal at the Stock Exchange hotel, in Manchester, when she confronted him with allegations of cheating – which he denied.</p> <p>He told the jury he returned home to find Greville and her younger sister packing Giggs’s dog’s toys, blanket and crate into the boot of the car.</p> <p>Giggs removed the items from the car and told the pair to leave but they refused, he said. They then tussled over a phone as Giggs threatened to call the police, the court heard.</p> <p>Addressing jurors from the witness box, Giggs said he and Kate fell to the floor as they tried to grab the device: “Kate ended up on her back, I was on top of her … and I was around her waist area.”</p> <p>He added: “Then Kate just proceeded to kick me in the head. As soon as we were on the floor I was getting kicked in the head and I was protecting my head. After about six or seven kicks to the head I just got up and we went our separate ways.”</p> <p>Emma Greville alleged that Giggs at this point struck her in the face with his elbow as she tried to lift him off her sister. Asked if this happened, Giggs said: “No.”</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Giggs said there was “no excuse whatsoever” for an email he sent Greville, with the subject line: “CUNT!!!” after she told him she did not want him to join her on a trip to Scotland in June 2020.</p> <p>Jurors had heard that the email read: “Only an evil horrible cunt does that. Absolutely astonishing. Now I look an utter twat after telling three of my friends I’m going to Scotland at the weekend … I’m so fucking mad now I’m scaring myself because I could do anything.”</p> <p>Asked by Daw whether there was any excuse for using that “truly appalling” language, Giggs said: “No excuse whatsoever.” He added: “I can’t believe I used that sort of language to someone I was supposedly in love with.</p> <p>Giggs was also asked about an incident in February 2020 in which he allegedly grabbed Greville by the wrist and pulled her arm during a holiday in Dubai.</p> <p>The former midfielder said he did not remember “any sort of physical interaction” with her. He said the argument arose after he mistakenly called her Stacey, the name of his ex-wife, following an afternoon drinking wine with Greville’s best friend.</p> <p>He said: “In my view it was just a stupid argument. I can understand why she was upset but it was a slip of the tongue”.</p> <p>The argument “escalated,” he said, and Greville said she was leaving their hotel room. “I said, ‘Listen, if you’re not going to treat it as a slip of the tongue you can go.’ I said, ‘Come on, this is stupid, it’s a stupid argument.’ She was insisting on leaving.”</p> <p>He told jurors: “I might have tried to stop her from leaving but I don’t remember any sort of physical interaction between me and Kate.”</p> <p>Giggs said he was “gutted” that the argument had spoiled an “amazing” holiday and that he was “devastated” on the flight home.</p> <p>The ex-Wales manager said there were “more ups than downs” in their six-year on-off relationship and that arguments like the one in Dubai did not tell “the full story of our relationships”.</p> <p>He said he never had control over her friendships, or travel, or how often she socialised. Greville has accused Giggs of controlling “elements” of her social life.</p> <p>Giggs told jurors there was “bickering” like in many relationships and admitted he had called “a team meeting” over the messy organisation of the dishwasher.</p> <p>He said: “I would be opening the dishwasher and the tablespoons and glasses would be the wrong way round. It would wind me up because I would have to do it again so I called a team meeting and just said, ‘Everyone, can you please put the tablespoons the right way round.’</p> <p>“It wasn’t a big argument. It was just how I explained it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/17/plumber-nathan-smith-guilty-road-rage-murder-london-deliveroo-driver-takieddine-boudhane","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T14:02:03Z","webTitle":"Plumber guilty of road rage murder of London Deliveroo driver","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/plumber-nathan-smith-guilty-road-rage-murder-london-deliveroo-driver-takieddine-boudhane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/plumber-nathan-smith-guilty-road-rage-murder-london-deliveroo-driver-takieddine-boudhane","fields":{"headline":"Plumber guilty of road rage murder of London Deliveroo driver","trailText":"Nathan Smith stabbed Takieddine Boudhane in Finsbury Park dispute then fled to Austria","byline":"Joe Middleton and agencies","body":"<p>A plumber who stabbed a Deliveroo driver to death in a road rage attack and then spent 17 months on the run in Europe has been found guilty of murder.</p> <p>Nathan Smith, 28, swung out with a knife and stabbed part-time delivery driver Takieddine Boudhane, 30, in the chest in a shocking attack that was captured on CCTV.</p> <p>Smith, in a white van, and Boudhane, who was riding a moped, both made a right turn in Finsbury Park, north London, on the evening of 3 January 2020.</p> <p>Boudhane, who was also a chef, was upset by Smith’s manoeuvre and words were exchanged between the two, before the 28-year-old left his van with a knife in his hand, jurors were told.</p> <p>Smith went “on the attack” with the blade and Boudhane used his crash helmet to ward him off.</p> <p>Describing CCTV footage of the incident, prosecutor Julian Evans QC said: “As Smith ran towards him, Takieddine swung his crash helmet towards Smith.

In other words: all of us.</p> <p>In 1995, a 32-year-old failed medical student called Brian MacKinnon became a global news story and a legend when it emerged he had, two years earlier, posed as a teenager called Brandon Lee to reattend his old school, Glasgow’s Bearsden Academy, taught by his old teachers who did not recognise him, just so that he could retake his Higher exams and reapply to medical schools, which would not admit people over 30.</p> <p>One of his classmates was Jono McLeod, and it is McLeod who has directed this film about MacKinnon’s extraordinary true-life tragicomedy, interviewing his school contemporaries and using animated sequences with Lulu and Clare Grogan voicing incidental characters. He also interviews MacKinnon himself who did not want to appear on camera, lip-synched instead by the actor Alan Cumming. It’s a verbatim-cinema effect which is intriguing if misleading. Cumming has a naturally approachable, sympathetic face whereas MacKinnon’s is blanker and more mask-like.</p> <p>With staggering chutzpah, this grown man, not so very far from middle age, put on a school uniform and bluffed his way through class, befuddled pupils who didn’t want to mention how weirdly old he looked, delighted teachers with his intelligence and maturity and even took the starring role in the school play, South Pacific, to universal acclaim, singing the line: “Younger than springtime am I …!” He had to kiss his 16-year-old leading lady, a disputed moment which is the subject of this film’s great revelation. MacKinnon avoided having to present a birth certificate to the teacher in charge of admissions – who declined to be interviewed – bamboozling her with a preposterous tale about having been privately tutored as he travelled around Canada with his now dead opera-singer mother who was estranged from his university professor dad.</p> <p>He might have got away with it entirely. In fact, he did get away with it entirely, in that he was admitted to Dundee University’s medical school, but thrown out in his first year when the scandal emerged, either because a classmate had seen his passport while on a Spanish holiday with him or because MacKinnon couldn’t help confessing – it’s not entirely clear.</p> <p>Which brings us to the semi-acknowledged elephant in the room. Wasn’t there something revoltingly inappropriate in this thirtysomething male consorting with teenage girls? Fascinatingly, everyone in the South Pacific cast (including MacKinnon and his leading lady) and everyone who saw it, remembers the climactic onstage kiss being embarrassing, sure, because it was such an awkward platonic peck. But then McLeod shows the video taken of the performance, which reveals something very different: a pretty definite kiss. Groupthink memory is trumped by the facts. Then there is the sad issue of MacKinnon’s elderly mother and how much she knew about his fraud.</p> <p>This is a film which could be put alongside other “faker” films, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/21/kaiser-the-greatest-footballer-never-to-play-football-review\">Louis Myles’s Kaiser: The Greatest Footballer Never to Play Football</a> or Bart Layton’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/23/the-imposter-review\">The Imposter</a>, in that it shows us not just a rational trickster who is coolly carrying off a dangerous pretence to get what he wants, but as someone in the grip of something beyond his conscious control. And you could compare it to many high school movies: after all, the whole high school movie genre is driven by thirtysomething screenwriters who are obsessed with their school days.</p> <p>My own theory is that MacKinnon’s spectacular dysfunctional meltdown helped create the market for the explosively popular, but toxically nostalgic website Friends Reunited, launched five years later in 2000. He was the guy crazy enough to live the dream: not the dream of being a medical student (which is entirely incidental to the story) but the dream (or nightmare) of being a teenager for a second time.</p> <p>• My Old School is released on 19 August in cinemas.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/17/church-of-england-pension-bosss-shares-shell-clive-mather","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T14:00:18Z","webTitle":"Church of England pension boss’s shares in Shell ‘shocking’, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/church-of-england-pension-bosss-shares-shell-clive-mather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/17/church-of-england-pension-bosss-shares-shell-clive-mather","fields":{"headline":"Church of England pension boss’s shares in Shell ‘shocking’, say campaigners","trailText":"Exclusive: Christian climate groups urge Clive Mather to resign and C of E to divest from fossil fuel","byline":"Damian Carrington Environment editor","body":"<p>The chair of the Church of England Pensions Board, which has not divested its £3.5bn fund from fossil fuels, is a shareholder in Shell, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>Clive Mather had a 38-year career at the oil company during which he oversaw a <a href=\"http://executives-in-the-news.blogspot.com/2008/06/clive-mather.html\">multibillion-dollar tar sands project</a> in Canada.</p> <p>The Church of England (C of E) has rejected pressure to sell off its fossil fuel holdings. Campaigners said these were unethical investments that were fuelling the climate crisis and urged Mather to resign.</p> <p>In Britain, the Baptist church and United Reformed church have divested from fossil fuels. Around the world, 17 Anglican dioceses are among more than <a href=\"https://divestmentdatabase.org/\">500 churches and faith-based organisations that have divested</a>.</p> <p>The leader of the C of E, the archbishop Justin Welby, said at a recent global conference of Anglican bishops: “It’s the call of the church to stand alongside our brothers and sisters around the Anglican communion, who are already affected by climate change, and to safeguard the environment upon which all of us depend.”</p> <p>Protesters at the conference calling for fossil fuel divestment included the Rev Vanessa Elston, from Southwark diocese and a member of the protest group Christian Climate Action. She told the Guardian the revelation that Mather owned shares in Shell was “shocking”.</p> <p>“The C of E needs to divest because the fossil fuel companies have been lying and greenwashing for 40 years,” she said. “They have acted wickedly. If they were serious about the climate crisis, they would be putting 50% of their profits into renewables, but they are not doing anywhere near that.”</p> <p>One of the <a href=\"https://www.lambethconference.org/programme/lambeth-calls/\">Lambeth Calls</a>, declarations published after the conference, demanded the “halting of new gas and oil exploration”. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas\">Shell’s short-term expansion plans</a> amount to about 4bn barrels of oil. Elston said: “If you really are going to fulfil that call, that means divesting.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://operationnoah.org/\">Operation Noah</a>, a Christian climate group, urged Mather to resign. “In light of his conflict of interest, Operation Noah calls for Mr Mather to consider his position,” said the Rev Dr Darrell Hannah, at All Saints church in Ascot and chair of trustees for the group. “And we again call on the C of E to divest from all fossil fuels immediately, not next year.”</p> <p>The C of E £10bn church commissioners fund has also not divested from fossil fuels.</p> <p>Bishop Shourabh Pholia, from the diocese of Barisal in Bangladesh and who attended the conference, said: “Up to 18 million people may have to migrate [from Bangladesh] because of sea-level rise,” he said. “Therefore, I want to stand with the protesters to do justice to the earth and save the whole of creation.”</p> <p>Mather has always recused himself from any discussion of, or direct contact with, Shell. A C of E spokesperson said: “Any suggestion that Mr Mather’s shares in Shell in any way influences the pensions board’s investment policy around fossil fuels would be false. The pensions board and church commissioners have a clear five-year strategy on fossil fuels, agreed by the General Synod in 2018.” </p> <p>He said the results included a net zero oil and gas standard being piloted by oil and gas majors, investor pressure leading to companies adopting emissions targets and divestment from companies refusing to engage. The C of E would divest from fossil fuel companies not aligned with the Paris climate agreement by July 2023, he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/21/concern-over-church-of-england-pension-board-fossil-fuel-industry-links\">Concern over Church of England pension board fossil fuel industry links</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the C of E’s general synod in July 2021, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XBIzPOVsz3o?t=22269\">Mather described his former employer Shell</a> as a “beacon across the sector”. Another member of the pensions board, Richard Hubbard, worked for BP for 28 years, while Welby was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Oil\">group treasurer for Enterprise Oil from 1984 to 87</a>.</p> <p>Divestment campaigners argue that selling off fossil fuel shares is a powerful way to reduce companies’ social licence to operate and restrict their access to capital. More than <a href=\"https://divestmentdatabase.org/\">1,500 institutions managing $40tn</a> have divested from fossil fuels, including almost 200 pension funds.</p> <p>Shell <a href=\"https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2020/servicepages/downloads/files/strategic-report-shell-ar20.pdf\">said in 2020</a>: “An erosion of our business reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand, our ability to secure new resources or access capital markets, and on our licence to operate.”</p> <p>Opponents of divestment argue engaging with companies as shareholders to drive change is a better way to tackle the climate crisis.

Every year, half a million visitors flock to its 12th-century priory, castle, pubs and cafes.</p> <p>But today’s residents – who number about 160 – say the government’s proposal to ban fishing in order to rewild the ocean threatens centuries-old livelihoods and would “rip the heart” out of the community.</p> <p>The plan would introduce a highly protected marine area (HPMA) of 129 sq km, covering the island and north-east of the Farne Islands to allow marine life to fully recover, according to Defra. The area, one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/20/five-highly-protected-marine-areas-set-up-in-english-waters-fishing-ban\">five pilot HPMAs </a>proposed for England, boasts <a href=\"https://consult.defra.gov.uk/hpma/consultation-on-highly-protected-marine-areas/supporting_documents/Annex%20F%20Lindisfarne%20candidate%20HPMA%20factsheet.pdf\">850 species of seabirds and fish</a>, 40 of which are threatened or important.</p> <p>“I don’t think it has been thought through properly,” Rev Canon Dr Sarah Hills, the vicar of St Mary’s parish church, told the Guardian. “And [I don’t think] Defra have considered the massive socio-economic impact. They could have make an effort to find out before they launched this proposal. It’s a real error.”</p> <p>Between 10 and 15% of the island’s permanent residents are small-scale crab and lobster pot fishers, the only type of fishers allowed in the already protected marine area.</p> <p>If the proposal went ahead, the fishers, who operate six boats from the island, would be “stumped”, Hills said. They couldn’t relocate to the north or south because other fishers already work there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01fadec7130cbd1a9f1c75faaaf9fa181536e9c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01fadec7130cbd1a9f1c75faaaf9fa181536e9c1/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fishing boats moored near Lindisfarne’s harbour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fishing boats moored near Lindisfarne’s harbour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Idp Northumberland Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Defra acknowledges that the plans could see fishers displaced to other ports along the coast, which would “lead to an increase in fishing pressure in the surrounding MPAs, and the potential to create conflict between fishers in this fleet due to the lack of space to place additional pots”.</p> <p>Hills said the islanders practice sustainable fishing and are not opposed to HPMAs per se. This was not an issue of “fishers against conservationists”, she said.</p> <p>The fishers argue that their methods have allowed a thriving seal population, citing a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82847-4\">scientific study</a> published by the University of Plymouth, which concluded “commercial pot fisheries are likely to be compatible with marine conservation when managed correctly at low, sustainable levels”.</p> <p>“The Church of England has many ways of trying to stand up for justice, and this is a real social justice issue,” said Hills, adding that the fishers had asked her to be their spokesperson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/09/uk-to-trial-highly-protected-marine-areas-in-win-for-ocean-campaigners\">UK to trial ‘highly protected marine areas’ in win for ocean campaigners</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said that if fishers on the island were forced out of work, they would have to leave the island entirely because the twice-daily tides make it possible to access the mainland for only 14 hours a day, making other employment difficult.</p> <p>Families of fishers study and work in its school, pubs and restaurants, and at least three are fully trained first responders – half of the coastguard team and the island’s 999 response, Hills said.</p> <p>The Northumberland Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (NIFCA), which would be responsible for regulating and policing the HPMA, said strict rules are already in place for fishers, including no trawling or dredging.</p> <p>“There are five types of marine protected areas around Lindisfarne,” said Les Weller, the chair of the NIFCA, “We are one of the most protected parts of the coast.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3edf6e52c4b157a9fdad1737756a6e94c5d92c13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3edf6e52c4b157a9fdad1737756a6e94c5d92c13/0_0_6587_4391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"About 160 people are permanent residents on Lindisfarne, whose tidal patterns limit access to the island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">About 160 people are permanent residents on Lindisfarne, whose tidal patterns limit access to the island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weller said he had only found out about the proposal from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/20/five-highly-protected-marine-areas-set-up-in-english-waters-fishing-ban\">a Guardian article published in June</a>. “This is a top-down consultation and is very ill-thought through,” he said. “Our seas here have never been in decline.”</p> <p>Weller said he would lead a “balanced consultation, from the bottom up”, and submit the result to Defra before the closing date on 28 September.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Defra said the consultation would inform future decisions on HMPA boundaries.</p> <p>“Highly protected marine areas will protect the marine environment and help a wide range of valuable habitats and species to fully recover while ensuring we can continue to meet the sustainable needs of those who rely on our seas”, the spokesperson said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/aug/17/higher-food-energy-costs-expected-push-up-uk-inflation-july-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T13:57:19Z","webTitle":"Cost of living crisis is ‘living nightmare’, say unions, after surprise inflation rise to 10.1.% -

With prices no longer rising rapidly, the increase in underlying retail sales is consistent with a rebound in real consumption at the beginning of the third quarter.</p> <p>The decline in gasoline prices last month easily explains the 1.8% fall in gasoline station sales. Motor vehicle sales declined by 1.6%, which was a bit of a mystery given the rise in manufacturers’ unit sales last month. Excluding gasoline and autos, sales rose by 0.7%, the same as in June, with the gain last month led by a 2.7% jump in non-store sales which more than offset small declines in department store and clothing sales. The key difference from June, however, is that prices are no longer rising rapidly, meaning that the increase in nominal spending will feed through to much stronger growth in real consumption in July.</p> <p>Admittedly, the muted 0.1% rise in food services sales suggests that the recovery in services consumption has slowed, but we calculate that real consumption rose by as much as 0.5% m/m last month. Even accounting for weaker growth in August and September, that leaves third quarter consumption growth on track for growth of 2.0%-2.5% annualised. That suggests the risks to our forecasts that GDP growth will rebound to 2.0% lie to the upside.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fce51a8f083e25be0ec1a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T12:59:33.230Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The muted retail sales figure was down to a 1.8% drop in gasoline sales, a 1.6% fall in cars and parts and a 1.7% decline in other vehicle sales. </p> <p>Excluding cars and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.7%. </p> <p>Food sales rose 0.2% while building and garden equipment sales were 1.5% higher.

In fact, borrowing might turn out to be even more expensive if financial markets take the view that Liz Truss and her ideas of “rewriting” monetary policy is a direct threat to the BoE’s independence. </p> <p>In other words, even higher interest rates (as a result of financial markets viewing BoE’s independence at threat) risk making a looming recession even worse. Quite frankly, the new prime minister (whether Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak) and BoE governor Andrew Bailey need to sit down and work together to counteract the adverse consequences of the looming recession.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fcc8d68f08b9fd3e4e046f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T11:01:35.053Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK credit card spending jumps 33%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Credit card spending has shot up by a third as more people turn to borrowing cash amid the cost-of-living crunch.</p> <p>UK credit card holders spent just under £20bn in May, a 33% jump in the total spend compared to the same month last year, according to official figures from trade body UK Finance.</p> <p>Debt also climbed, with outstanding balances on credit card accounts growing nearly 10% in the year to May.

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We ask that the UK government continues to support children and their families by urgently bringing social security packages in line with current energy costs and inflation.

At least 38,000 cars crossed on Tuesday – a record.</p> <p>The mass exit came after an ammunition dump and electricity sub-station blew up near the town of Dzhankoi, a significant railway hub. Another apparent Ukrainian strike took place outside the regional capital Simferopol, where a Russian airbase was destroyed.</p> <p>Zelenskiy hinted that similar inventive attacks could be expected. He urged Ukrainians living in Crimea and the occupied south to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said.</p> <p>These might also explode because of “bungling”, he added, describing his country’s struggle against Russian occupiers as a “people’s war of liberation”. Millions of Ukrainians were fighting against a “terrorist state”, he added.</p> <p>In its latest intelligence update, the UK Ministry of Defence said Russia’s military leaders were likely to be “increasingly concerned” about the surge of setbacks in Crimea. The defence ministry in Moscow has vowed to deal with what it called local “sabotage”.</p> <p>Six alleged Islamist extremists were detained on Wednesday, according to Crimea’s Moscow-appointed head, Sergey Aksyonov. It was not clear what relation – if any – those arrested had to the recent attacks, which include a strike last week on the Saky aerodrome.</p> <p>At about 3am on Wednesday Russian strategic aircraft bombed the port city of Odesa, firing two long-range missiles. Four people were wounded. The rockets set fire to a recreation centre in the region and several homes nearby.</p> <p>The Kremlin’s initial war aim was to seize Odesa, a Russian-speaking city founded by Catherine the Great, and to link up with the Moldovan enclave of Transnistria, where Russian “peacekeeping” troops are based.</p> <p>The plan unravelled when Ukrainian forces halted attempts to capture the neighbouring city of Mykolaiv and sank Russia’s flagship carrier, the Moskva. Since then the amphibious threat to Odesa has been largely neutralised, military analysts believe.</p> <p>There are growing signs that Moscow is planning to press ahead next month with a “referendum” to annex the southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. A Ukrainian counter-offensive to recapture the city of Kherson occupied since March has yet to happen.</p> <p>In the run-up to the “vote”, Russian soldiers have been hunting down local community leaders. The latest victim was Svitlana Korotun, the mayor of the village of Verkhny Rohchyk. She was kidnapped for refusing to cooperate with the Russians, and has disappeared, regional officials said.</p> <p>In the occupied southern city of Melitopol explosions reportedly took place near a Russian command centre. Details were sketchy. The area is at the centre of a significant partisan uprising, which has involved harsh countermeasures enacted by Russian troops, and so-called “filtration” of entire districts.</p> <p>Writing <a href=\"https://t.me/ivan_fedorov_melitopol/419\">on Telegram</a>, Melitopol’s mayor-in-exile, Ivan Fedorov, said that a “loud explosion rang out near the enemy’s lair” in the centre of the city. “Let me remind you that one of the commandant’s offices of the occupiers is located here,” he said.</p> <p>He added: “The earth will burn under the occupiers. This unshakable truth is proven every day by our soldiers from the armed forces of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> in the south of Ukraine.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, at least two people were killed in the latest shelling in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor, reported that Russian forces had attacked the already wrecked towns of Avdiivka and Zaitseve, close to territory held by Russian-controlled separatists.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/17/entain-settlement-failing-rules-make-gambling-safer-crime-free","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T13:48:52Z","webTitle":"Gambling giant Entain could lose UK licence amid record £17m fine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/17/entain-settlement-failing-rules-make-gambling-safer-crime-free","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/17/entain-settlement-failing-rules-make-gambling-safer-crime-free","fields":{"headline":"Gambling giant Entain could lose UK licence after record £17m fine","trailText":"Ladbrokes and Coral owner fined for failing to protect customers after new gambling laws came in","byline":"Rob Davies","body":"<p>Entain, the gambling firm behind Ladbrokes and Coral, could lose its licence to operate in the UK after it was told to pay a record £17m settlement over its inaction as individual customers spent hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p> <p>The Gambling Commission highlighted multiple failings in Entain’s online and high street business, all of which occurred after the government announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/04/uk-gambling-laws-review-to-consider-ban-sports-sponsorship\">review of gambling laws</a> that has led the industry to promise to improve controls to tackle addiction and prevent money laundering.</p> <p>The “completely unacceptable” incidents, which triggered Entain’s second regulatory settlement in three years, included carrying out just one chat interaction with a customer who spent long periods gambling in the middle of the night over 18 months, depositing £230,845.</p> <p>Another customer who was blocked from betting with Coral over concerns about their betting was allowed to set up another account with a different Entain brand and deposit £30,000 in a day.</p> <p>A third individual was allowed to deposit £742,000 in 14 months without appropriate checks on what they could afford, while another, who was known to live in social housing, was allowed to deposit £186,000 in six months without sufficient checks.</p> <p>In a series of other incidents, customers lost hundreds of thousands of pounds, without being subjected to checks on their source of funds.</p> <p>The failings took place as the industry lobby group, the Betting and Gaming Council, was publicly pushing back against proposals designed to prevent vulnerable people incurring punishing losses, such as strict affordability checks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BetGameCouncil/status/1548578375169712128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Voters are sending a message to Westminster that they don’t appreciate being told by Government how to spend their hard earned money.

And also, though, I’m going to be making sure that people all around this country understand the stakes of what we’re facing, understand the extent to which we’ve now got one major political party, my party, which has really become a cult of personality.</p> \n<p>“We’ve got to get this party back to a place where we’re embracing the values and the principles on which it was founded. And talking about fundamental issues of civics, fundamental issues of what does it mean to be a constitutional republic.”</p> \n<p>Cheney, daughter of former Republican vice-president Dick Cheney, attacked both Trump and the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, the architect of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/12/liz-cheney-house-leadership-republican-caucus-vote\">ousting from the party’s House leadership</a> in May 2021 after she denounced the former president’s false claims of a stolen election. She expressed her belief that “the Republican party today is in very bad shape”.</p> \n<p>“Donald Trump has betrayed Republican voters. He’s lied to them. Those who support him have lied to them and and they’re using people’s patriotism against them,” she said.</p> \n<p>“They’re preying on people’s patriotism. Kevin McCarthy made his decision a few weeks after January 6, knowing what he knew about Donald Trump’s role in the assault on the Capitol, when he went to Mar-a-Lago and said we’re going to welcome him back into the party. To me, that’s indefensible.</p> \n<p>“I believe that Donald Trump continues to pose a very grave threat, a risk to our republic, and I think defeating him is going to require a broad and united front of Republicans, Democrats and independents. That’s what I intend to be a part of.”</p> \n<p>To some in the crowd of supporters on Tuesday night – gathered in an open field beside a red vintage Chevrolet truck, four US national flags, a dozen hay bales and a hospitality tent – it already sounded like the launch of a presidential campaign.</p> \n<p>They welcomed the prospect out of both principle and pragmatism: Cheney would have little chance of winning but could peel crucial votes away from Trump.</p> \n<p>Heath Mayo, 32, a lawyer, said: “There are few people making an argument counter to the prevailing Trumpism argument. She’s the only one that can make it. I certainly hope she’s not done. I hope she runs for president in 2024.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/experts/2-carol-adelman\">Carol Adelman</a>, who hired a 22-year-old Cheney for the US Agency for International Development, noted that the congresswoman received a John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award from the JFK Library earlier this year. “We need that, not the profiles in cowardice that the Republican party has today. Ultimately, they will go.”</p> \n<p>Alan Reid, 60, who works in finance, said of a possible presidential run: “Who else? Who’s better? I don’t see anybody from any party that shows the leadership that Liz shows.”</p> \n<p>But a Cheney candidacy could pose a dilemma for Democrats who recall that she voted in line with Trump’s position 93% of the time during his presidency, according to the FiveThirtyEight website.</p> \n<p>Marci Shaver, a registered Democrat, switched to Republican in 2016 so she could vote against Cheney; this time she switched to Republican so she could vote for Cheney.</p> \n<p>She explained: “I was so impressed with her integrity on the committee and the way she has stood firm, knowing damn well she was going to lose this election. I was born and raised here and this is the kind of integrity that Wyomingites, when I was growing, totally respected. For them to dismiss that in this election just breaks my heart.”</p> \n<p>Bill Sniffin, publisher emeritus of the <a href=\"https://cowboystatedaily.com/\">Cowboy State Daily</a> news site in Wyoming, wrote in a blogpost: “Liz Cheney’s concession speech sounds a lot more like the announcement of someone planning to run for president in 2024 than an admission of defeat back here in 2022.”</p> \n<p>He added: “This is not the end of Liz Cheney.

The UK does lag behind many other western countries in the productivity league table. Across the G7 group of major industrial countries, the average worker produces <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfinalestimates/2020\">13% more an hour</a> than the average British worker and the gap is getting bigger.</p> <p>Official data also appears to show a divide between London and the rest of the country, with workers in the capital apparently 80% more productive than the national average. Truss suggests this is a mindset issue.</p> <p>The idea, though, that the UK’s deep-rooted economic problems are caused by shirking or a lack of effort does not stand up to serious scrutiny. Britain has one of the most deregulated labour markets in the developed world and the average British worker puts in more hours a week than the European average.</p> <p>Monitoring and surveillance in many workplaces are intense, with disciplinary measures for those that fail to meet quotas. This is a country where management has the whip hand and, for the most part, workers are not protected by unions. To the extent Truss’s analysis was ever true, it harks back to a labour market that has long since disappeared – now replaced by one in which an army of gig economy and self-employed workers toil away to make a living.</p> <p>The real reason for Britain’s poor productivity lies elsewhere. UK <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/aninternationalcomparisonofgrossfixedcapitalformation/2017-11-02\">business investment</a> as a share of national output, or gross domestic product, is the lowest in the G7. It is a similar story with <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04223/#:~:text=non%2Dprofit%20organisations.-,International%20comparisons,in%20France%20it%20was%202.2%25.\">research and development</a>, to which the UK devotes 1.7% of GDP annually, compared with an average of 3.1% for members of the developed country club, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p> <p>Britain’s economic model is based on an abundance of cheap labour and under-investment in up to date capital equipment and product innovation. Skills levels are higher in a country such as Germany because the Germans invest more in training.</p> <p>The difference between Britain and better performing countries is not that they work harder than we do, but that they work smarter than we do. Foreign-owned companies in the UK tend to have higher productivity, so if “mindset” is the issue then it is the mindset of management that counts.</p> <p>Nor is it really the case that productivity is higher in London because workers in the capital have a “can do” spirit lacking elsewhere. As a paper from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/21/regional-policy-requires-rethink-as-myth-of-london-productivity-debunked\">researchers at Sheffield Hallam University</a> found, once adjusted for factors including the size of the working age population, the concentration of high productivity jobs in finance and the number of hours worked, the gap virtually disappears.</p> <p>Truss’s team say the remarks made some years ago have been taken out of context but they seem pretty clear. If Boris Johnson’s probable successor thinks more graft is needed, she is completely misdiagnosing the problem.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/17/beachgoers-warned-to-stay-away-after-sewage-alerts-across-england-and-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T13:37:45Z","webTitle":"Beachgoers warned to stay away after sewage alerts across England and Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/beachgoers-warned-to-stay-away-after-sewage-alerts-across-england-and-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/17/beachgoers-warned-to-stay-away-after-sewage-alerts-across-england-and-wales","fields":{"headline":"Beachgoers warned to stay away after sewage alerts across England and Wales","trailText":"Discharges following heavy rainfall affecting water quality, especially in south","byline":"Chelsie Henshaw","body":"<p>Swimmers have been warned to stay away after sewage was discharged on beaches across England and Wales, predominantly in the south.</p> <p>Pollution alerts have been issued to beachgoers by the Environment Agency, and on some beaches signs have been put up to warn people.</p> <p>The environmental campaign group Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) <a href=\"https://www.sas.org.uk/map/\">has collected data</a> that suggests storm sewage discharges have taken place in the waters of beaches in Cornwall, Cumbria, Devon, Essex, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Northumberland and Sussex.</p> <p>Storm overflows are designed to allow sewers to overflow into rivers and the sea when they reach their capacity from torrential rain.

It described support services as “buckling under pressure”, leaving children “ricocheting around services” which are “over-medicalised, bureaucratic, unresponsive, outdated and siloed”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/30/speed-up-mental-health-care-uk-children-report-nhs-four-weeks\">£1bn needed to speed up mental health care for UK children, report says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a psychologist working with young people and child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) for 25 years, the report resonates. Services are organised by diagnosis, but medical psychiatric diagnoses are not a perfect science even for adults, let alone for developing children and adolescents, whose stress responses are subject to change. A child who struggles to concentrate and is feeling pressure about schoolwork, for example, may on some days feel sad and low and on others anxious and worried, and may use both self-harming and not eating as strategies to cope.<br><br>Labelling these feelings as “ADHD” or “anxiety” or “depression” or “eating disorders” or “OCD” can be a quick shorthand to summarise their experience and guide treatment. But, as this report highlights, they are instead being used as a ticket of entry to different parts of Camhs. Given that services are full already, children with multiple tickets are told to go elsewhere; that their “disorder” doesn’t reach clinical severity. Managers pull up the drawbridge to protect their services. <br><br>Why do managers do this? Because Camhs workers, as in almost all NHS sectors, are completely overworked. Clinicians are being pushed to do more with less, managing larger caseloads with fewer resources – and the higher levels of distress is affecting morale and retention. I am seeing staff ask for career breaks, work fewer hours or move to the private sector where a better work-life balance is possible.<br><br>NHS staff do not leave lightly. People enter healthcare because they want to help, and leaving is a tortured decision. As Adam Kay’s memoir, This is Going to Hurt, illustrated; NHS staff become disillusioned when demands on them exceed their capacity. We have seen it happen with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/24/one-woman-took-out-13-of-her-own-teeth-the-terrifying-truth-about-britains-dental-crisis\">dentistry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/numbers-of-nurses-and-midwives-leaving-nhs-highest-for-four-years\">midwifery</a>, and I fear Camhs will be next.<br><br>Government investment in mental health, such as it is, has focused on mental health support teams employing education mental health practitioners, who are generally new graduates given minimal training, on low salaries. They are using these positions to <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/children-and-young-people-s-mental-health-trailblazer-programme.html\">start their careers</a> before moving on after a year or so. This is a major design flaw: it takes time for distressed children and adolescents to trust adults, and it is that trusting relationship which allows them to heal and take therapeutic advice. An adult may arrive to therapy primed and ready to accept advice, but adolescents are more sceptical about adults’ opinions, and successful therapy with this population requires earning their respect before they will listen. Making these relationships is the challenge (and the joy) of Camhs work. It is less likely to happen if education mental health practitioners move on after a year.<br><br>Good mental health for children and adolescents requires positive, long-term relationships with adults who care and value them. Ideally, this happens in the home, but can additionally or alternatively happen in communities, schools, youth clubs, sports grounds and dance troupes. Mental health services are a last resort. But what I do know is that kids become disenfranchised from society without links to positive adult role models and interests that engage them.<br><br>Covid exacerbated the mental health problem, but even prior to that diagnoses were soaring. Given the evidence that <a href=\"https://www.youngminds.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/mental-health-statistics\">one in six children</a> are suffering a probable mental health condition, it’s time the government considers every policy’s impact on the wellbeing of younger people. My heart sank when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/08/truss-and-sunak-ideas-on-education-are-sugar-rush-policymaking-says-expert?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_b-gdnnews&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter\">Liz Truss promised</a> new selective grammar schools and Oxbridge entry interviews for all triple A* students, because I see every day the victims of these exclusionary “race to the top” education policies. These policies harm not just the young people who fail the crucial exam or exams – and often suffer from a sense of “not being good enough” into their adult years – but also for the anxious perfectionists who are on a relentless hamster wheel of academic excellence until they break emotionally. <br><br>As a therapist and a Camhs worker, it won’t surprise you that I think we need more investment in fully trained staff and a focus on staff retention. But the answer lies not simply with just more Camhs, but with better Camhs. We need joined-up thinking about entry to mental health services at a regional health level, so that young people and their families are no longer “ricocheting” between services, with managers forced to play pass the patient to protect their overworked teams. <br><br>We need a distress-led service, rather than a diagnosis-led service. We need services, both for mental health and in the community, which prioritise long-term care, not short-term repair, and government policy that is mindful of the mental health of the next generation. We must tackle the root of young people’s problems, not just their symptoms.

The majority of the Jamaican immigrants who came to the UK in the 50s settled there – my own grandparents plumped for Stevenage, just north of the city. And yet, in the 2011 census, it was estimated that up to 5,000 of Britain’s then 160,000 Jamaican-born population – and plenty more West Indians besides – live in Leeds, the northern city I moved to as an adult. In celebration of Jamaica’s 60th anniversary of independence, the Leeds community have chosen to mark their own contribution to the city’s culture with the <a href=\"https://www.jamaicasocietyleeds.co.uk/out-of-many-festival/\">Out of Many festival</a>, a Lottery-funded string of arts and cultural events named after Jamaica’s motto and organised by the Jamaica Society Leeds.</p> <p>Five days before the launch of its opening exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/events/rebellion-romance-exhibition\">Rebellion to Romance</a>, curator and festival director Susan Pitter shows me around the floorspace at Leeds central library. A second-generation Jamaican, Pitter has been active in the community since her teens, presenting Caribbean current affairs on local radio before being introduced to Arthur France, founder of the Leeds West Indian Carnival. </p> <p>Building on her 2019 exhibition Eulogy, Rebellion to Romance is less about marking the achievements of first-generation Windrush communities, and more about celebrating the culture of her era; the 1970s and 80s. “With Eulogy, we had so much ephemera to work with; my parents’ generation kept everything,” Pitter explains. “But by the 80s, everything was disposable. I hope that by doing this project, it shows that every time we keep something – a ticket to a show, a poster, whatever – it helps us tell a story. And nobody else can tell our story the way we can.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30322ea3b67e3cd0bd15efb428da58935351cc0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30322ea3b67e3cd0bd15efb428da58935351cc0e/85_199_3001_4438/676.jpg\" alt=\"The hub of all important activity … Misty In Roots performing at Rock Against Racism Carnival in Potternewton Park in June 1981.\" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hub of all important activity … Misty In Roots performing at Rock Against Racism Carnival in Potternewton Park in June 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Corio/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what a rich and illustrious story it is. Without TripAdvisor to hand, 20th-century West Indian immigrants relied on word of mouth to plot their destinations, following intrepid friends and family. As such, each community of West Yorkshire has a slightly different makeup; a Dominican dominance in Bradford, a big Grenadian community in Huddersfield, and then a mix of Jamaicans, Kittitians and Nevisians in Leeds, all bringing different cultural influences. With a limit to the number of places where young Black Leeds folk could feel truly welcome, the district of Chapeltown became “their world”, and Potternewton park the unofficial headquarters, a space to hang out and listen to local sound systems. “Having physical spaces to gather was so important,” says Pitter. “I feel like there are third and fourth-generation West Indians who will never know the joy of a house party how we had them.”</p> <p>Those house parties were pivotal. While West Indian kids were allowed to attend christenings and events with older family chaperones, the explosion of shebeen or “blues” parties gave them a taste of a more potent musical culture. Unlicensed (and therefore illegal), blues were held in the basements of Chapeltown’s back-to-back terraced houses, running all night with a blend of reggae and lovers rock. For <a href=\"https://www.peepaltreepress.com/authors/khadijah-ibrahiim\">Khadijah Ibrahiim</a>, a local poet and educator whose grandparents came over in the 50s, these parties were not just gatherings; they were an opportunity to host some of Jamaica’s most exciting musicians, drawn to the Ibrahiim family home because of their activism.</p> <p>“My mum always says ‘You know, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/06/the-return-of-jimmy-cliff-rebel-spirit-is-still-in-the-jamaican-people?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\">Jimmy Cliff</a> used to date your godmother,’’’ she laughs. “She would cook for the Wailers,<a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/53889-The-Cimarons\"> the Cimerons</a>, <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/77086-Alton-Ellis\">Alton Ellis</a>. My grandparents were part of an activist group called the Brotherhood, firmly connected to [Marcus] Garveyism in their philosophy. As I got older, things started to click; we had the Chapeltown News, connected to a more national press, Race Today, and that’s how I read about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/15/the-story-of-the-mangrove-nine\">Mangrove Nine</a> and got involved in meetings. For me as a poet, that’s what I react to; the inequalities, but also the richness of culture.”</p> <p>This sense of activism as an inevitable consequence of the racism they experienced rings through many second-generational experiences. “The year I turned 18, there was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/15/how-the-new-cross-fire-became-a-rallying-cry-for-political-action\">New Cross fire</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/11/brixton-riots-40-years-on-a-watershed-moment-for-race-relations\">uprisings</a> across the country,” says Pitter. “I was just getting used to going out, but it changed things; it was like, ‘Is this room too crowded? What might happen?’ It was always at the back of our minds. Did it stop us? Not really, but it shook us. It should have shaken the whole of Britain, really.”</p> <p>Even before the New Cross house party fire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/17/forty-years-on-from-the-new-cross-fire-what-has-changed-for-black-britons\">claimed 13 young Black lives in London</a>, communities were starting to push back. Formed in 1978 by Paul Furness, the Leeds branch of Rock Against Racism made vocal allies of local groups such as the Mekons and Gang Of Four, who played with Black reggae acts such as Bodecian in front of mixed, antiracist audiences. When the Specials headlined the Rock Against Racism Carnival in June 1981, it was held in Potternewton park, hub of all important activity.</p> <p>In 1987, Rock Against Racism also marked the debut of an exciting new Leeds act. Long before any millennial white rockers could claim the name, Chapeltown sisters Paulette and Annette Morris performed as jazz-reggae duo Royal Blood. Daughters of local steel pan royalty St Clair Morris, they found success with lovers rock single Slipping Away, touring with everyone from the Roots to Boyzone. Paulette remembers the Rock Against Racism show as a day of “electric” community atmosphere. “We had Black theatre, Black dance, Saturday schools teaching Black history. All the individual islands our parents came from didn’t matter, because my generation bonded through the racism we experienced.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiELXbi_HK2pkQXAHupwqjQ?app=desktop\">Claude “Hopper” Hendrickson</a> also found ways to make lemonade out of the sour lemons of exclusion. Meeting me at the West Indian Centre, where he serves as a director, he tells me that in being the first to fully unite the three core principles of costume, music and a masquerade parade, Leeds technically predates Notting Hill’s now-familiar offering by one year. “Considering we’re the furthest bastion in the north of Britain of big African-Caribbean concentration, we’ve really contributed.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ceb770f8ead459cd4946ca13634d45ed244099d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceb770f8ead459cd4946ca13634d45ed244099d0/0_180_5570_3342/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the Rebellion to Romance exhibition at Leeds central library.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lemonade from the sour lemons of exclusion … Gillian Gordon and Jeffrey ‘Skully’ Walwyn pictured in the Rebellion to Romance exhibition at Leeds central library.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JMA Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now in his 60s, Hopper has been playing in sound systems since he was 14. “We’d meet at <a href=\"https://www.jumborecords.co.uk/index.asp\">Jumbo Records</a> on a Saturday, all of my friends, and each buy the same thing. One friend went to Jamaica and came back with two suitcases full of records; we all dived in and realised that we had all this new music to play that nobody else had, and that’s where Dragon Hi-Fi began.” As white boys objected to their presence in their nightclubs – “although the white girls didn’t seem too bothered, interestingly” – sound systems were a safe haven. “Getting into sound systems was really about creating a space where we didn’t have to fear; racism actually led us to create something of our own.”</p> <p>David Hamilton also created safe spaces for Black boys, although his legacy continues in dancers of all genders and backgrounds. Under the tutelage of PE teacher Nadine Senior (later the founder of the Northern School of Contemporary Dance), his love of movement began at Harehills middle school, where dance lessons were treated with the same co-ed seriousness as maths or English. In 1981, aged 18, he founded the original Phoenix Dance Company with friends Donald Edwards and Vilmore James, joined a year later by Merville Jones and Edward Lynch. Soon the five-piece were touring 46 weeks of the year, revolutionising contemporary dance with elements of dub skanking and toasting.</p> <p>Hamilton stepped down as artistic director in 1987, but is reuniting the original lineup for a one-off performance as part of the Out of Many event programme. Since then, a huge number of dancers have passed through Phoenix Dance’s doors. “What can we say?” he laughs. “Us guys made a chance for ourselves, and through that, a chance for others.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5d84303033e568167d5aa286853a4584a2b5c56a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d84303033e568167d5aa286853a4584a2b5c56a/972_0_3049_3812/800.jpg\" alt=\"(from left) Miriam Wilkes, Derek Lawrence, Susan Pitter, Amaha Lawrence and Carol Patterson at the Rebellion to Romance exhibition.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It’s quite overwhelming’ … (from left) Miriam Wilkes, Derek Lawrence, Susan Pitter, Amaha Lawrence and Carol Patterson at the Rebellion to Romance exhibition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JMA Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chances made by Leeds’ second-generation creatives have filtered down to today. With a large student population, Leeds is no stranger to adoption; <a href=\"https://www.niknakdjmusic.uk/home\">NikNak</a>, an electronic turntablist of Jamaican heritage, moved to the city six years ago to study, but has stuck around ever since. Recently, she has been working with Opera North and the West Yorkshire Playhouse, collaborating with Ibrahiim on a multi-media performance piece, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/opera-north/sets/dead-n-wake-dj-niknak-and-khadijah-ibrahiim\">Dead ‘n’ Wake</a>. “To forge friendships within the community, whether it’s Leeds born and bred, or something of a tourist like myself, it’s really affirming.”</p> <p>When Rebellion to Romance launches, many of these faces fill the room. After rum punch and a group singalong of Janet Kay classic Silly Games, the exhibition is opened, images and donated artefacts telling a story that only this community can. <a href=\"https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/news/leeds-news/harehills-restaurant-owner-running-itvs-21766063\">Maureen Wilkes</a>, member of the Jamaica Society Leeds and owner of the city’s finest Caribbean takeaway, exclaims at a large picture of herself as a child, torn between glee and tears: “It’s quite overwhelming, isn’t it?” With many of the historical images displayed alongside up-to-date photos of their subjects by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/aug/12/photographer-vanley-burke-immortalised-black-britain-interview\">Vanley Burke</a>, it is telling how many families have remained so close to home.</p> <p>For these stories to stay visible though, they need to be nurtured. With Rebellion to Romance, Pitter hopes that she might pass the baton to another generation, paving the way for the next phase of storytelling.</p> <p>“People ask me what I’m planning to exhibit next, but the truth is, I’m not,” she says. “I’ll certainly help and guide, but the 90s onwards?

Oltermann in Berlin","body":"<p>The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has accused Israel of committing “50 Holocausts”, at a joint press conference with Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin, drawing condemnation from Germany and Israel.</p> <p>At the end of his state visit to Germany’s chancellory on Tuesday night, Abbas was asked by a German journalist whether he planned to apologise for the deadly attack by Palestinian militants on Israeli citizens at the 1972 Munich Olympics, the 50th anniversary of which is on 5 September.</p> <p>The militant group Black September, which killed 11 Israeli athletes and one German police officer during the hostage-taking, was linked to Abbas’s Fatah party at the time.</p> <p>“If we want to dig further into the past, yes, please, I have 50 massacres that were committed by Israel,” the Palestinian leader said at the end of the press conference. “Fifty massacres, 50 Holocausts, and to this day, every day, we have dead people killed by the [Israeli Defence Forces], by the Israeli army.”</p> <p>Scholz, who had criticised Abbas for describing Israel as perpetuating an “apartheid system” earlier on in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbEm-FlZ_aA\">press conference</a>, did not immediately respond verbally to the Holocaust comparison but shook the Palestinian president’s hand after his spokesperson announced the end of the question-and-answer session.</p> <p>Scholz condemned the remarks on Wednesday morning. “I am disgusted by the outrageous remarks made by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas”, Scholz <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1559780922714734597\">tweeted</a> from his official account. “For us Germans in particular, any relativisation of the singularity of the Holocaust is intolerable and unacceptable. I condemn any attempt to deny the crimes of the Holocaust.”</p> <p>The head of the Palestinian diplomatic mission was summoned to the German chancellory in protest on Wednesday afternoon, Reuters reported.</p> <p>The remarks also drew fire from various German politicians. “The PLO leader would have gained sympathy if he had apologised for the terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics 1972,” said Armin Laschet, the conservative candidate who lost out to Scholz in last September’s federal elections. “Accusing Israel of 50 Holocausts instead is the most disgusting speech ever heard in the German chancellery.”</p> <p>The tabloid Bild criticised Scholz for not directly challenging Abbas about his choice of words, which it described as “the worst Holocaust relativisation that a head of government has ever uttered in the chancellor’s office”.</p> <p>Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, of the Free Democratic party, a partner in the coalition government, criticised the chancellor’s spokesperson for not giving Scholz time to respond at the end of the press conference. “The question has to be asked whether he’s the right person in his role,” she told Der Spiegel.</p> <p>Yair Lapid, the Israeli prime minister, said Abbas’s comments were “not only a moral disgrace but a monstrous lie”, especially as they were made “on German soil”.</p> <p>Approximately 6 million Jews were murdered by the German Nazi party regime and its accomplices over the last four years of the second world war.</p> <p>Israel’s designated ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said: “There has to be zero tolerance for Mahmoud Abbas’s Holocaust denial on German soil.”</p> <p>The Palestinian leader’s visit to Berlin followed a trip to Paris in July, seen as part of a broad diplomatic effort to rouse European interest in Palestine’s cause in the face of America’s apparently waning interest in restarting the peace process in the Middle East.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2022/aug/17/hundreds-of-authors-to-read-from-salman-rushdies-works-in-show-of-solidarity","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T12:30:27Z","webTitle":"Hundreds of authors to read from Salman Rushdie’s works in show of solidarity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/aug/17/hundreds-of-authors-to-read-from-salman-rushdies-works-in-show-of-solidarity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2022/aug/17/hundreds-of-authors-to-read-from-salman-rushdies-works-in-show-of-solidarity","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds of authors to read from Salman Rushdie’s works in show of solidarity","trailText":"The ‘Stand with Salman’ event in New York mirrors a public reading of The Satanic Verses that took place after the fatwa was issued in 1989","byline":"Sarah Shaffi","body":"<p>Hundreds of writers are to gather in New York this week to read from Salman Rushdie’s works, in a recreation of an event first held after the fatwa on the author was issued in 1989.</p> <p>Authors including Paul Auster, Tina Brown, Kiran Desai, Amanda Foreman, AM Homes, Siri Hustvedt, Hari Kunzru and Gay Talese will be among those taking part in the “Stand with Salman” event.</p> <p>The writers will gather on the steps of the New York Public Library on Friday morning, exactly a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/12/salman-rushdie-attacked-onstage-new-york\">75-year-old Rushdie was stabbed</a> during an event at the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York.</p> <p>The Indian-born British author is currently recovering in hospital.

That is £20,000 higher than a year earlier.</p> <p>While the annual rate of growth had slowed, said Ceri Lewis, a statistician at the ONS, “house prices continue to increase, and average prices have now reached record levels in England, Wales and Scotland”.</p> <p>At the same time, rents have continued to climb across the country, with a “sustained pick-up” in London.</p> <p>The latest ONS data, which goes up to the end of June, follows figures from other sources up to the end of July or into early August that have indicated house prices are beginning to fall as higher interest rates and the broader cost of living crisis start to bite.</p> <p>Earlier this month the Halifax, one of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders, said house prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/05/uk-house-prices-fall-for-first-time-since-june-2021-says-halifax\">fell in July for the first time in more than a year</a>, while the property website Rightmove said on Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/uk-house-prices-drop-for-first-time-this-year-says-rightmove\">they had fallen for the first time in 2022</a>.</p> <p>However, the ONS put the slowing rate of annual house price inflation down to “the rises in prices seen in June 2021, which were the result of tax break changes”.</p> <p>Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said last year’s stamp duty holiday had distorted the annual figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“A huge part of the drop [from 12.8% to 7.8%] is due to the fact that it’s compared to last June, when price rises hit a peak. This was when the most generous period of the stamp duty holiday was coming to an end, and people dashed to take advantage – vastly inflating prices.”</p> <p>She added: “For a clearer picture, it’s worth checking month-on-month figures. These show that prices were up an average of £3,000 between May and June.”</p> <p>The ONS said that in England the average house price had increased by 7.3% over the 12 months to £305,000. In Wales, the average figure rose by 8.6% to £213,000. In Scotland, typical prices climbed by 11.6% to £192,000, while in Northern Ireland they rose by 9.6% to £169,000.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/indexofprivatehousingrentalprices/july2022\">Separate ONS data</a> showed private rents paid by UK tenants typically rose by 3.2% in the 12 months to July, up from 3% in the year to June.

And tonight, Harriet Hageman has received the most votes in this primary. She won. I called her to concede the race. This primary election is over.

She was watched by family members including her parents Dick and Lynne.</p> \n<p>As the sun set on her – literally and figuratively – Cheney issued a rallying cry for the defence of democracy and, in remarks that lasted around 15 minutes, made clear that she does not accept that her political career is over.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d98ec3511ad3024fba4d7b5636a1c60eedffdd4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d98ec3511ad3024fba4d7b5636a1c60eedffdd4/0_544_8154_4892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hand painted sign against Cheney displayed on the side of a road in Casper, Wyoming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hand painted sign against Cheney displayed on the side of a road in Casper, Wyoming.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cheney referenced her work on the January 6 committee and condemned fellow Republicans for pushing conspiracy theories. She also warned that supporters of Trump’s “big lie” about voter fraud are currently running for state offices.</p> \n<p>“Our nation is barreling once again towards crisis, lawlessness and violence,” she said. “No American should support election deniers for any position of genuine responsibility.”</p> \n<p>Cheney criticised the rightwing backlash against the FBI search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate that has led to threats of violence against federal law enforcement.</p> \n<p>“Our great nation must not be ruled by a mob provoked over social media,” she said.</p> \n<p>Cheney has faced death threats and been forced to abandon traditional campaign stops and public rallies in favour of small-scale private events.</p> \n<p>To applause, she reiterated her pledge that she “will do whatever it takes to ensure Trump is never again anywhere near the Oval Office. And I mean it.”</p> \n<p>She left the stage to the sound of Tom Petty’s song I Won’t Back Down.</p> \n<p>Trump wrote on his social media platform: “Liz Cheney should be ashamed of herself, the way she acted, and her spiteful, sanctimonious words and actions towards others. Now she can finally disappear into the depths of political oblivion where, I am sure, she will be much happier than she is right now. Thank you WYOMING!”</p> \n<p>Earlier, a country and western band played as Cheney supporters mingled under a white marquee, drinking wine and eating from a buffet of fresh fruit and cheese and crackers, and a food truck serving barbecue sliders, pulled pork and beef brisket.</p> \n<p>The mood was upbeat and defiant despite the imminent defeat, with guests praising Cheney for putting country above party and some advocating a presidential run in 2024.</p> \n<p>Kenneth Adelman, a former US ambassador to the United Nations, said: “Whatever happens, she’s a winner. What she did was courageous. She showed that she was willing to put her politics on the line.”</p> \n<p>But nationally, leading Republicans were eager to celebrate Cheney’s defeat. Trump’s son, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr\">Donald Trump Jr</a>, tweeted: “Bye bye <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney\">@Liz_Cheney</a>. On the bright side at least you won’t have to pretend to be from Wyoming anymore.”</p> \n<p>In a statement released before the race was called, Elise Stefanik of New York, who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/14/996540840/new-yorks-elise-stefanik-installed-as-new-gop-conference-chair\">replaced Cheney</a> as the number three House Republican, said: <em>“</em>Congratulations to Harriet Hageman on her massive Republican primary victory in Wyoming over Nancy Pelosi’s puppet Liz Cheney.</p> \n<p>“… Harriet is a true America First patriot who will restore the people of Wyoming’s voice, which Liz Cheney had long forgotten.”</p> \n<p>Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, followed suit, saying Hageman would “make Wyoming proud”.</p> \n<p>Critics of the ex-president declared Cheney the moral victor. The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group formed by disaffected conservatives, said: “Tonight, the nation marks the end of the Republican party.</p> \n<p>“What remains shares the name and branding of the traditional GOP, but is in fact an authoritarian nationalist cult dedicated only to Donald Trump.”</p> \n<p>David Axelrod, former top strategist for Barack Obama, tweeted: “Through the lens of history, Liz Cheney will be remembered as a hero; Harriet Hageman, the answer to a trivia question.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/17/the-feast-review-welsh-folk-horror-dials-up-the-creepiness","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T12:00:15Z","webTitle":"The Feast review – Welsh folk horror dials up the creepiness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/17/the-feast-review-welsh-folk-horror-dials-up-the-creepiness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/17/the-feast-review-welsh-folk-horror-dials-up-the-creepiness","fields":{"headline":"The Feast review – Welsh folk horror dials up the creepiness","trailText":"Cannibalism, torture, gory sex and meaty subtexts are all on the menu at a dinner party held by an arrogant local MP","byline":"Leslie Felperin","body":"<p>Set and shot in Wales, with dialogue in Welsh (apart from a few loan words from English and the occasional Anglo-Saxon cuss), this is a striking, reasonably original wodge of folk horror.

This claim is based upon a series of investments aimed at shifting buying habits away from a polluting status quo towards cleaner, electrified vehicles and appliances.</p> <p>A US household could save $1,800 on their energy costs each year, <a href=\"https://www.rewiringamerica.org/policy/inflation-reduction-act\">according to a recent estimate</a>, although this would require the installation of electric heat pumps for hot water and air conditioning, replacing a gasoline-powered car with an electric vehicle and installing solar panels on the roof.</p> <p>But even without these modifications, the climate bill is expected to lower costs by funneling support to renewable energy projects, such as wind and solar, that will provide a less price volatile source of electricity than gas, coal and oil.</p> <p>“There are people who are really on the frontlines of the inflation crisis and how expensive fossil fuels are because of [Vladimir] Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and this bill will be delivering big energy savings for those people,” said Leah Stokes, a climate policy expert at the University of California.</p> <h2>Electric cars</h2> <p>The new legislation, once passed, will provide a tax rebate of up to $7,500 for a new electric vehicle, which can be transferred to the car dealer so it can act as an upfront payment. Electric cars have so far been the domain of the wealthy, accounting for less than 5% of total car sales in the US, and the bill tries to remedy this by also offering a $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles (EVs), in the hope that lower-income people will be able to take advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f8fb4528dda989a581a5b5135f69886198f833b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f8fb4528dda989a581a5b5135f69886198f833b/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"EV charging stations are seen at Overpeck county park in Leonia, New Jersey.

The tax credit applies to cars made with parts made in the US or from countries that have a free trade agreement with the US, meaning that the leading suppliers of key materials like cobalt and lithium – China and Russia – are excluded.</p> <p>Ongoing supply chain woes also mean that the demand for EVs is currently outstripping supply, with many carmakers having long waiting lists for models, while public charging infrastructure is still patchy in much of the country.</p> <h2><strong>Solar panels</strong></h2> <p>Anyone who wants to install solar panels on their property can now get a 30% tax credit, a program that runs until 2034. People who use home-based batteries for energy storage can also access the credit.</p> <p>Erecting solar panels isn’t cheap, costing an average of $20,000 according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, but this upfront cost is eventually recouped, and more, by the savings in energy bills.</p> <p>Rooftop panels are becoming more common in new buildings, too, with states such as California passing mandates that new developments must include them. People in apartments can have the option of leasing a rooftop solar system, or joining a community solar farm.</p> <h2>Home appliances</h2> <p>Some of the biggest changes initiated by the climate bill are likely to be found in the homes of Americans, with up to $14,000 in rebates available to low- and middle-income households to make their dwellings greener and more efficient.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc56dd5cedfa1ad55518f71977302a8f2a6be74c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc56dd5cedfa1ad55518f71977302a8f2a6be74c/0_430_4827_3218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wei-Tai Kwok replaced his gas cooktop with an induction cooktop at his home that he completely converted to electric to stop using natural gas in Lafayette, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wei-Tai Kwok replaced his gas cooktop with an induction cooktop at his home in Lafayette, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Avila Gonzalez/The San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An $8,000 rebate will be available to help install heat pumps, which are efficient electrical devices that both heat and cool homes, with a further $1,750 for water heating.

Would-be owners are required to pass a road safety test at their local police station, and every bicycle requires a licence plate – a metal tag showing where it was registered, along with a registration number, that is displayed at the front.</p> <p>As in other countries, bicycles are considered a status symbol in North Korea.</p> <p>Japanese bikes are reportedly the most sought after, followed by locally made models that are said to be manufactured by prison labourers. Chinese bikes are the least coveted, according to Beijing-based Koyro Tours, which has organised cycling breaks for foreign visitors to Pyongyang and other parts of North Korea.</p> <p>In 2015 it was reported that North Korea had installed bicycle lanes on major roads in Pyongyang, apparently to address accidents involving cyclists and pedestrians. It was also a reflection of in increase in the number of people who could afford a bicycle, although they are still beyond the reach of many of the country’s 26 million people.</p> <p>While licence plates are non-negotiable, a ban on women riding bicycles has been harder to enforce. Women were reportedly forbidden from cycling in 1995 by the then leader, Kim Jong-il, partly because he believed the sight of a woman striking a “seductive” pose on two wheels would corrupt public morals.</p> <p>Others say the reason is more prosaic: Kim ordered the ban, with fines and even confiscation for offenders, after the daughter of a high-ranking official died after she was hit by a car while riding her bike in Pyongyang.</p> <p>His son and successor, Kim Jong-un, who has been pictured on horses and amusement park rides, but never on a bicycle, lifted the ban in 2012, only to reimpose it a year later.</p> <p>Reports from Pyongyang suggest that while the ban is still in place, harsh economic reality means it is rarely enforced. Many women would be unable to buy and sell goods at markets or take their children to and from school without a bicycle.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/17/coast-to-coast-from-cumbria-to-north-yorkshire-wainwright-route-national-trail-status","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T11:39:09Z","webTitle":"On the Coast to Coast from Cumbria to North Yorkshire: Wainwright route gains national trail status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/17/coast-to-coast-from-cumbria-to-north-yorkshire-wainwright-route-national-trail-status","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/17/coast-to-coast-from-cumbria-to-north-yorkshire-wainwright-route-national-trail-status","fields":{"headline":"On the Coast to Coast from Cumbria to North Yorkshire: Wainwright route gains national trail status","trailText":"New designation for one of England’s most famous walks – a lifeline for many small northern towns – brings £5.6m funding","byline":"Hugh Thomson","body":"<p>The news that the much-loved <a href=\"https://www.coasttocoast.uk/\">Coast to Coast</a> path is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/12/alfred-wainwrights-coast-to-coast-walk-made-national-trail\">finally to become an official national trail</a> – which brings extra funding of £5.6m from Natural England – should not be surprising. For some time it has been one of England’s most popular and iconic walks. The only surprising thing is how long the designation has taken.</p> <p>It was in 1973 that Alfred Wainwright extended his range from the Lake District by describing this 192-mile walk, which starts on the west coast at St Bees in Cumbria and ends in the east at Robin Hood’s Bay on the Yorkshire coast. There’s a handy book that you sign to show you’ve done it in the <a href=\"http://bayhotel.info/c2c.html\">Bay Hotel</a> and possibly a certificate. You can, of course, do it the other way around, but as Wainwright wisely pointed out, by going west to east you have the prevailing weather behind you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/12/alfred-wainwrights-coast-to-coast-walk-made-national-trail\">Alfred Wainwright’s coast-to-coast walk to be made National Trail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He wanted a walk that gave a cross section of northern England, so you rise up to the Lake District from the Irish Sea, cross the Quaker landscape of the Howgills, go down one of the prettiest of the Yorkshire Dales and then have a final, triumphant crossing of the wild <a href=\"https://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/\">North York Moors</a>. It’s a terrific route and manages to include the gorgeous spa town of Richmond along the way, for a bit of half-time refreshment and a break. It’s no wonder it quickly became a national favourite.</p> <p>I can claim to know the walk as well as anyone, because I’ve taken it, quixotically, with a pack-mule, which meant my pace was relatively slow. Jethro, while a sturdy character, was not the fastest on the blocks, but this slow pace enabled me to study the terrain in greater detail.</p> <p>I found that small market towns such as Kirkby Stephen in Cumbria have been transformed by the Coast to Coast, as it’s a natural stop-off point for the 6,000 or so walkers who take the route each year. These days the town has a Coast to Coast fish and chip shop, several outdoor walking shops and a bustling tourist information centre in the old cloisters. A lot of this is down to one person: by including Kirkby Stephen as a key stopping point, Wainwright put it on the map.</p> <p>After the news broke about the new national trail status, I discussed it with Mark Peatfield, the owner of the Eden Outdoors walking gear shop in Kirkby Stephen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The walkers are like swallows. They start arriving in the spring, mass in the summer and then by autumn they’re leaving</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Peatfield, Eden Outdoors</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although there’s a plaque in honour of Wainwright in the main square, there’s no statue. Should this be rectified, I asked Mark.</p> <p>“I was born in what is now the Coast to Coast fish and chip shop,” Mark said. “Fish and chips was Wainwright’s favourite dish. I remember him eating it. We wouldn’t get any visitors at all without him. These days – or at least after the pandemic – the hotels get a bucket-load of people staying right through the season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf098e624e874f4c5c8444931307988172465891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf098e624e874f4c5c8444931307988172465891/17_49_3954_2372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Thomson on Coast to Coast trail with his pack-mule, Jethro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Thomson on the trail with his pack-mule, Jethro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Thomson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I always refer to the walkers as swallows. They start arriving in the spring, mass in the summer and then by autumn they’re leaving. It’s not just because of the cold. You need long days to manage the stages. By November, the light’s fading too early.”</p> <p>According to Mark, the Coast to Coast has changed in character since Wainwright devised the route nearly 50 years ago.</p> <p>“It used to be just British people who walked it, the sort of people who used his guides in the Lake District and then followed through with this. But now it’s international. More than half the people who come through are from overseas, mainly Americans and Australians. And international travellers often want their kit carried for them – who wouldn’t? – so ‘Sherpa services’ have grown up to drive their luggage round to the next destination. That’s been a change. In the old days, everyone carried it themselves in too big a rucksack.”</p> <p>Mark welcomes the new funding to help “rationalise” the route, particularly through tricky sections like the area around Nine Standards Rigg on Hartley Fell, near Kirkby, which is notorious for its bogs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/may/19/walking-the-coast-to-coast-solo-female-lake-district-north-yorkshire\">‘I was dog-tired but exhilarated’: hiking the UK’s Coast to Coast route</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“A fellow got sunk in there a few years ago. Rescue team had to get him out. He was carrying a big pack. Went down to his waist. Got sucked right in and couldn’t get back out again. He came into the shop later and told me the story, or I wouldn’t have believed it. Apparently, he was stuck for over an hour before the rescue team arrived. And his girlfriend took pictures of him stuck in the bog while they were waiting.”</p> <p>When I took Jethro along that section of the Coast to Coast (or, to use an abbreviation I dislike, the C2C), carefully avoiding potential mule-trap bogs, I was surprised how little cared for it was. And, for that matter, under-signposted. I met many walkers who had got lost, particularly in bad weather.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4e3eb3e621cd80922527e2e57ce77f1085ef9342\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e3eb3e621cd80922527e2e57ce77f1085ef9342/30_380_5280_3167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nine Standards Rigg in the Pennines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nine Standards Rigg in the Pennines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicky Beeson/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jethro and I made it safely through to Robin Hood’s Bay.

Yet oddly, Wainwright himself might not have been pleased. He often took the paradoxical position – like Wordsworth – that while he might write about wild places like the Lakes, he didn’t necessarily want his books to attract visitors.

The True the Vote chief, Catherine Engelbrecht, arranged the event, Mack told the Guardian.</p> <p>The gathering lasted about seven and a half hours and featured talks by Engelbrecht and Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county, Arizona, who teamed up in June to create ProtectAmerica.Vote. to promote a larger role for sheriffs in election monitoring, said Mack.</p> <p>“I totally support what they’re doing,” said Mack, who leads the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, which has thousands of members around the country, including hundreds of sheriffs.</p> <p>The event, to which Mack invited several of his staff and two former law enforcement officials, provided “more evidence of quite extensive election fraud”, said Mack. “There’s no way anyone in this country should be trusting computers to tabulate votes.” The meeting, which was covered live by the conservative Right Side Broadcasting Network, was held at a venue “ that was very surreptitious”, added Mack, former sheriff of Graham county, Arizona.</p> <p>Notably, the gathering also heard at the outset from Kari Lake, the Trump-backed GOP gubernatorial nominee for Arizona and former Fox News reporter, and was attended by Mark Finchem, a state legislator and the Trump-endorsed nominee for secretary of state, which has authority over election supervision, according to Mack. Both Lake and Finchem are prominent election deniers.</p> <p>The meeting, about a half-hour outside Scottsdale, underscores how sheriffs with Lamb’s group, Protect America Now, and Mack’s group, are working with True the Vote to provide more muscle to investigate charges of current and past voting fraud, despite numerous reports indicating such fraud is historically small, and was not significant in 2020 elections.</p> <p>At a press conference in Las Vegas on 12 July with several sheriffs and Engelbrecht, Mack declared that investigating voting fraud is now his group’s top priority, calling it a “holy cause”.</p> <p>Voting watchdogs raise strong concerns about the budding alliances between far-right sheriffs and True the Vote.</p> <p>“There is a critical role for law enforcement to play in protecting our elections: they should be offering protection to election officials and election workers that have come under attack as a result of lies being spread by groups like True the Vote,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, the acting director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center. “When law enforcement or anyone else spreads false claims about elections, they’re contributing to pressure on election officials.”</p> <p>Morales-Doyle added: “True the Vote was one of the groups behind the failed lawsuits seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It has a long history of anti-voter conduct, including orchestrating mass challenges to voters, as it did in the 2021 Georgia runoff elections.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c93a1bff9e1171575ace95d1351ea4a04d366d4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c93a1bff9e1171575ace95d1351ea4a04d366d4b/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of True the Vote during an event held by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 12 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of True the Vote during an event held by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 12 July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridget Bennett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Engelbrecht and Mack have sparked other criticism for promoting 2020 election conspiracies, and Mack’s sheriff’s outfit and other sheriffs have pushed the dubious concept that they have extraordinary powers in their counties and can intervene in the running of elections and access voting equipment.</p> <p>Mack’s Constitutional Sheriffs website, which he launched in 2011 and has hundreds of members, claims that a sheriff’s authority in a county is greater than those of other officials and “even supersedes the powers of the president”.</p> <p>Mack and his group have prompted other concerns due to ties to anti-government groups: Mack spent a few years on the board of Oath Keepers, the militia group that played a key role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol that led to several of its members being charged with seditious conspiracy, before he left the board in 2016.</p> <p>“I think it’s a significant overreach of authority by sheriffs across the country, including Mack and Lamb, to on their own declare they have the authority to investigate voting fraud,” said David Mahoney, a former president of the country’s largest sheriffs organization, the National Sheriffs Association which represents some 3000 sheriffs.</p> <p>“Mack has promoted a whole host of conspiracies,” said Mahoney, who spent 15 years as sheriff of Dane county, Wisconsin. “I think it’s entirely for self-aggrandizement and to make himself relevant. Mack is playing to a far-right constituency and helps feed conspiracies.”</p> <p>Mahoney added that Mack “has said individuals have the right to form militias. I put very little credibility in him.”</p> <p>But Mack and True the Vote now seem to be on the same page in a growing crusade to hunt for election fraud.</p> <p>Last month in Las Vegas during the annual libertarian Freedom Fest, Mack’s group hosted a panel talk that featured several like-minded sheriffs and Engelbrecht, who revealed her rationale for enlisting sheriffs in her long-running search for alleged voting fraud.</p> <p>“All of a sudden, it’s like the lights went on. It’s the sheriffs,” she told an audience of about 200 attendees at the event. “That’s who can do these investigations. That’s who we can trust.”</p> <p>To cement other ties and bolster the hunt for voting fraud, True the Vote and a sheriffs group led by Lamb, Protect America Now which claims about 70 members in 30 states, in June formed ProtectAmerica.Vote.</p> <p>The joint effort features an “election integrity hotline” that True the Vote has deployed in past elections that can connect citizens with tips to sheriffs and ads that the group hopes to run in a “handful of states”, Engelbrecht told the Guardian.</p> <p>ProtectAmerica.Vote also may give grants to some sheriffs in key states such as Wisconsin and Michigan where county sheriffs have launched investigations into alleged election fraud, and provide surveillance equipment to monitor drop boxes and other voting sites, she added. To date Engelbrecht said they had raised slightly more than $100,000 of a $1m-plus goal.</p> <p>“There’s no question there was tremendous election fraud in 2020,” Engelbrecht said despite numerous reports stating otherwise. “We have big, big problems. We found many ways in which the election process was subverted in 2020.”</p> <p>Engelbrecht added her new drive with sheriffs aims to “identify preventive solutions to avoid a repeat of 2020”.</p> <p>The website for ProtectAmerica.Vote states its mission is to “empower sheriffs” and “connect citizens and sheriffs” as part of a wide-ranging drive to ferret out potential voting fraud. In a video on its website Sheriff Lamb of Pinal county says: “We will engage voters, we’ll help clear up confusion through education and where necessary sheriffs can and will investigate where laws are being broken.”</p> <p>Since Engelbrecht, an early Tea Party activist, founded the dark money True the Vote in 2009 it has raised millions of dollars boasting to have discovered widespread voting fraud, but not revealed significant evidence to back up such allegations, say several voting analysts and watchdogs.</p> <p>True the Vote’s financial angels have in recent years included several of the right’s top donors. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, State Policy Network, Franklin Center for Government &amp; Public Integrity, DonorsTrust, the League of American Voters and Judicial Crisis Network have reported giving money to True the Vote since its founding, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign financing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/29/donald-trump-big-lie-film-2000-mules-dinesh-dsouza\">Trump’s ‘big lie’ hits cinemas: the film claiming to investigate voter fraud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>True the Vote has seen its star rise in Trump world and “big lie” circles this year due to its key role in 2000 Mules, a film by rightwing provocateur and commentator Dinesh D’Souza that purported to show major fraud linked to ballot drop boxes in 2020, but was widely panned for its weak evidence.</p> <p>True the Vote supplied surveillance video and cellphone tracking data that were instrumental in making the film. But critics have faulted it for its flawed methodology and unproven claims that Democrats rigged the vote in several major states Biden won by paying “mules” who delivered 400,000 illegal votes.</p> <p>Former attorney general William Barr called the film “singularly unimpressive” during an interview he had with the House panel investigating January 6. Other critics go further.</p> <p>“2000 Mules failed spectacularly in its efforts to present demonstrable evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election,” said David Levine, a former Idaho election official and the elections integrity fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy.</p> <p>“Experts in geo-tracking data analysis say GPS data from apps on cellphones aren’t even precise enough to place cellphone users <em>at</em> a drop box, let alone show the commission of a crime at one.”</p> <p>Mack was impressed by the documentary, which debuted at Mar-a-Lago, saying the evidence it presented “is overwhelming and justifies criminal investigation”. But Mack added that “if True the Vote and D’Souza lied they should be charged”.</p> <p>Still, the heavy criticism of 2000 Mules spurred True the Vote to make several promises that more explosive evidence would be coming soon.</p> <p>At the Arizona meeting on 13 August, Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, a key associate who had starred in 2000 Mules, finally unveiled their promised bombshell, dubbed “The Pit”.</p> <p>What Phillips had hailed as “devastating” materials that were left out of 2000 Mules turned out to be only a new website Open.ink where they promised to put election lawsuit documents from various states and surveillance videos of drop boxes.</p> <p>On another controversial front, True the Vote’s financial operations have drawn more scrutiny since June when Reveal news published a well-documented report focused on questionable accounting and insider financial dealings that seem to have personally benefited Engelbrecht and key associates.</p> <p>Engelbrecht attacked the story, saying “it was filled with inaccuracies”.</p> <p>Marc Owens, a former chief of the tax exempt division at the Internal Revenue Service, told the Guardian that Reveal’s report underscored “a pattern of insider financial transactions totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars involving Engelbrecht and the organization’s senior management and advisers”.</p> <p>More broadly, True the Vote’s growing alliance with sheriffs to mount aggressive election fraud monitoring drives has prompted some former federal prosecutors to raise strong concerns.</p> <p>“I am aware of no state that permits vigilante-style election monitoring and voter fraud hunting by zealous conspiracy minded conservatives and sheriffs,” Paul Pelletier, the former acting chief of the fraud section at the Department of Justice, said.</p> <p>“Given True the Vote’s history of wholly unsupportable claims of fraud, the group’s ‘election monitoring’ alliance with some sheriffs who claim extraordinary powers for themselves runs the risk of violating federal law by intimidating voters. It seems to me they are flying too close to the sun here, and I am sure the DoJ [Department of Justice] will pay special attention to anyone who acts to intimidate or interfere with voters who are exercising their rights so fundamental to a democracy.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/us-labor-agency-union-activity","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"US labor leaders say underfunding at federal agency has ‘reached crisis stage’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/us-labor-agency-union-activity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/us-labor-agency-union-activity","fields":{"headline":"US labor leaders say underfunding at federal agency has ‘reached crisis stage’","trailText":"Union officials fear that the overstretched NLRB won’t be able to handle the surge in union activity, giving corporations the upper hand","byline":"Steven Greenhouse","body":"<p>Labor leaders in the US are worried that the federal agency that oversees unionization efforts is approaching a “true crisis” as it struggles with a decade of underfunding and a huge surge in union activity.</p> <p>Last year saw <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/correction-first-three-quarters-union-election-petitions-up-58-exceeding\">a 58% jump in the number of union elections</a> as union drives spread at companies including Amazon, Apple, Starbucks and other companies. Some labor leaders say they are worried that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has become so understaffed that it will have a hard time investigating the flood of allegations that Starbucks has violated America’s labor laws hundreds of times in its efforts to crush a historic unionization drive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/11/starbucks-union-drive-strikes\">Starbucks workers hold strikes in at least 17 states amid union drive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Union officials fear that the overstretched NLRB won’t be able to handle all these cases in a timely manner – including cases seeking to win reinstatement of fired pro-union baristas – and that as a result, Starbucks will get the upper hand in beating back the union campaign.</p> <p>With the labor board’s budget frozen for many years, union leaders voice dismay that congressional Democrats did not increase the NLRB’s funding as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate, healthcare and tax package that Joe Biden signed on Tuesday.</p> <p>“We’ve been blocked for nine straight years in seeking to increase the NLRB’s funding, and inflation has left its budget 25% behind where it should be,” said Bill Samuel, legislative director of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main labor federation. “When you take into account the explosion in the NLRB’s workload because of increased organizing, renewed enforcement and the increase in labor law violations, they’ve reached a crisis stage.”</p> <p>Largely due to Republican opposition, the NLRB’s budget has been frozen at $274m since fiscal year 2014, with Biden proposing an increase to $319m for fiscal 2023. As a result of budgetary strains, the NLRB’s field staff has been cut by 37% since 2014 and 50% since 2002.</p> <p>“If there is one beast that Republicans love to starve the most, it’s the part of the government that protects workers’ ability to form unions and bargain collectively,” said Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat. Levin said he urged the Senate majority leader, Charles Schumer, to increase NLRB funding as part of in the Inflation Reduction Act, but it wasn’t included in the final, carefully negotiated package.</p> <p>Had NLRB funding been part of the budgetary reconciliation package, it would have needed only a simple majority to pass the Senate – and avoided a Republican filibuster, a move that requires 60 votes to overcome, a nearly insurmountable obstacle for pro-labor legislation when the Democrats have just 50 Senate seats.</p> <p>“Not getting it into the reconciliation package means we’re not likely to get [increased NLRB funding] at all,” Levin said. “The situation at the NLRB is a true crisis.”</p> <p>Lynne Fox, president of Workers United, the union that workers at 220 Starbucks have voted to join, said she was worried about the NLRB being underfunded and understaffed. “Obviously it hurts our campaign and every organizing campaign,” Fox said.</p> <p>The NLRB has brought 19 formal complaints against Starbucks, alleging scores of illegal actions, and it is investigating more than 100 other charges that workers have brought alleging illegalities by Starbucks, including, spying on workers, intimidation and closing stores in retaliation for unionizing. All this has helped create a backlog in NLRB cases, and baristas say that NLRB delays, for instance, on winning reinstatement of fired baristas, could discourage and slow unionization efforts. “It’s obvious that Starbucks is playing the system to their advantage,” Fox said.</p> <p>A Starbucks spokesperson denied that Starbucks has gamed the system or broken the law: “We have fully honored the process laid out by the NLRB and encouraged our partners to exercise their right to vote in the election to have their voices heard. Any claims of unfair labor practices are categorically false.”</p> <p>Republican lawmakers strongly oppose raising NLRB funding. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the senior Republican on the House education and labor committee, said, “Increasing the NLRB’s annual budget to over $300m is the equivalent of using a spray bottle to put out a grease fire – it’s an inherently stupid idea. Under this administration, the NLRB has become the errand boy for labor unions.”</p> <p>Larry Cohen, former president of the Communications Workers of America union, lobbied hard behind the scenes to increase NLRB funding in the Inflation Reduction Act – he fears that having a badly underfunded NLRB will make it easier for aggressive anti-union employers to defeat unionization drives. Referring to Starbucks’ CEO, Cohen said, “Howard Schultz is hiring as many lawyers as he can because he knows that delay means defeat. There’s a massive number of unfair labor practice cases involving Starbucks, and understaffing is a real problem.”</p> <p>The NLRB says that Starbucks workers have filed over 250 unfair labor practice charges against the company. “The NLRB is working day and night on an endless stream of cases,” said Cohen, who long headed the AFL-CIO’s organizing committee. “Howard Schultz knows that Starbucks is not going to win on the merits, that they will only win through delay and more delay.”</p> <p>Despite not winning a funding increase in the Inflation Reduction Act, the AFL-CIO’s Samuel expressed optimism that the NLRB could win a budget increase through the appropriations process. But many labor supporters are not optimistic because that process could face a Republican filibuster. “The real story is the Republicans are completely unyielding,” Samuel said.</p> <p>The NLRB union protested at the failure to increase the board’s budget in the Inflation Reduction Act. “We are disappointed to have been snubbed yet again,” the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheNLRBU/status/1557033942070558720?s=20&amp;t=RZuR0kolMiAU5lh55h8XFA\">union tweeted</a>. “The IRS needed additional funding to enforce federal tax law, and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheNLRBU/status/1557033951398711297?s=20&amp;t=RZuR0kolMiAU5lh55h8XFA\">NLRB needs the same</a> to enforce federal labor law.”</p> <p>The Inflation Reduction Act failed to include something else that unions badly wanted: a provision that for the first time would have allowed substantial fines against employers that break the law when they are fighting unions, for instance, by firing workers for supporting unionization. Under current law, employers can’t be fined for violating the National Labor Relations Act.</p> <p>“It’s unfortunate that the labor board is being handcuffed just when it is turning itself around with new leadership to protect workers who want to unionize and bargain collectively,” the AFL-CIO’s Samuel said. “They’re fighting with one hand tied behind their back.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/17/london-nightclub-unionise-nightlife-sector-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"An east London nightclub has shown how to unionise the nightlife sector – and win | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/london-nightclub-unionise-nightlife-sector-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/london-nightclub-unionise-nightlife-sector-britain","fields":{"headline":"An east London nightclub has shown how to unionise the nightlife sector – and win","trailText":"Bars and clubs are some of the worst places to work in Britain. Dalston Superstore shows how unions can change that, says Guardian columnist Owen Jones","byline":"Owen Jones","body":"<p>The joy of Britain’s nighttime revellers is sustained by an army of low-paid, precarious and harassed workers. More than eight in 10 bar staff earn less than <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/its-time-to-end-the-scandalous-lowpay-lowrights-culture-that-grips-the-hospitality-sector\">£10 an hour</a>, and in the hospitality sector staff turnover is <a href=\"https://www.ukhospitality.org.uk/blogpost/1721400/325437/Retaining-Staff\">double</a> that of the national average. Bullying from management and harassment from customers is rife. Although 425,000 people work in the nightlife sector (this number has fallen by <a href=\"https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2021/10/uk-night-time-sector-loses-86000-jobs/\">tens of thousands</a> since the pandemic), unions have a pitifully weak presence in Britain’s bars and clubs. Recently, a trendy east London venue has forged a new path. It could spark a revolution in the sector.</p> <p>At Dalston Superstore, a queer venue in Hackney, LGBTQ+ partygoers and their straight allies down shots while drag queens and gender non-conforming artists dance raucously on bar tops until the early hours. “Everyone that’s queer goes to Superstore, or knows about it, or knows people who work there,” says 25-year-old Ayanna, who’s poured pints there for more than a year. When the management hired a new welfare team to protect customers’ and bartenders’ wellbeing, existing staff discovered that these new workers were being paid £15 an hour – more than the London living wage of £11.05 that most staff received. The bar’s management were adamant that this was the going rate for a stressful job, that welfare officers’ hours were limited because of the intensity of the role, and their wages were not supplemented with tips. Nonetheless, this frustration opened a floodgate.</p> <p>Staff called a meeting at which other grievances swiftly emerged. Some were mundane, such as dishwashers not running hot water on certain nights. Others were more serious: the staff are all queer and many are people of colour. Some feared for their safety when travelling home in the early hours (these fears are are well-founded – hate crimes against LGBTQ people are <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/93akz3/lgbtq-hate-crimes\">surging)</a>. In April, staff at Dalston Superstore approached the Unite union for support.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that Dalston Superstore’s owner, Dan Beaumont, is widely regarded as a very well-intentioned employer. His bar staff are paid more than most in the sector. Tips are ring-fenced for staff; in many other places, they are taken by management. “Dan is obviously a very good person and politically aware,” says Janet MacLeod, Unite’s service sector organiser, “but it’s the workforce who stood up, actively sought out a union and got unionised.”</p> <p>What Superstore underlines is that no matter how benevolent the management, checks and balances are needed to mitigate the inherent imbalance of power between workers and bosses. Only unions can offer this check on power and give workers a space where they feel secure about voicing their grievances.</p> <p>Superstore’s management swiftly recognised the union and held a grievance meeting with staff. Some complaints were based on misunderstandings, but others were more serious. Workers who had previously lacked a space to raise complaints said they felt managers were failing to act on customer aggression, for example. “It’s been very difficult because I’ve always wanted to be exemplary as an employer,” admits Beaumont. “Having a light shone on your failures, especially on the most vulnerable members of your team: well, it was a necessary wake-up call for us on these things.”</p> <p>The company quickly made changes: staff are now reimbursed for taking taxis home in the early hours, a toilet is reserved exclusively for staff, monthly training has been introduced for new workers and negotiations have begun over pay. The newly unionised staff of Superstore have set off a chain reaction: workers at another nearby queer bar have followed suit, and other bars in the area are taking note. “I’m a longstanding union organiser and I’ve brought in many agreements,” says MacLeod, “but it’s the first time I’ve seen unionisation be so contagious.”</p> <p>One of the profound challenges facing unions in the hospitality sector is that many of its young workforce are simply unaware of what unions are. Many don’t have relatives who were union members. After the wage councils that allowed for wage levels to be set across entire sectors were abolished in the early 1990s, bosses in nightlife have been able to suppress pay and scrap training opportunities. But unions’ flaws are also at play: not least, their failure to make many workers from marginalised backgrounds feel welcome.</p> <p>The notoriously poor conditions in the nightlife sector have led to an exodus of staff. Now, staff shortages could strengthen the hand of remaining workers, while surging prices have given low-paid workers a choice: either fight back or sink into acute hardship. Beaumont also reckons that the lasting trauma of a pandemic that forced precarious workers to put their health at risk has spurred on demand for change in the sector.</p> <p>These struggles depend on workers in low-paid sectors finding their voice. “It’s quite easy as a hospitality worker to feel worthless, that you’re just an ant in the system,” says Superstore bartender Sophie. There is a sense that has been widely internalised across our economy and society that low-paid workers deserve their plight. “But you <em>are</em> of value to the employer, it’s a skilled job being a barista, which you should be rewarded for,” she tells me.</p> <p>Superstore’s new Unite branch is already planning to hold regular meetings and launch a zine for hospitality workers who want to learn from its example. If this revolution is to succeed, it will have to confront significant challenges. As members of a minority that suffers discrimination, many young queer workers have already been politicised, and are therefore more disposed to progressive ideas such as unionisation. This doesn’t always apply to their peers.</p> <p>Compared to the management at Superstore, other managers are not so benevolent. Across the sector, high staff turnover makes organising trickier. But Unite is bullish about overcoming these roadblocks. Success stories such as Superstore will only embolden workers who have long been expected to simply accept insecurity and hardship for the sake of the nation’s piss-ups. Many have had enough, as the head honchos of Britain’s nightlife may soon discover.</p> <ul> <li><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/17/top-10-books-about-starting-afresh-the-last-days-ali-millar","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T11:00:14Z","webTitle":"Top 10 books about starting afresh | Ali Millar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/17/top-10-books-about-starting-afresh-the-last-days-ali-millar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/17/top-10-books-about-starting-afresh-the-last-days-ali-millar","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 books about starting afresh","trailText":"Writers from Anne Tyler to Joan Didion and Tom McCarthy explore the possibilities and perils of remaking one’s life","byline":"Ali Millar","body":"<p>The idea of a fresh start, of a new beginning, has a beguiling appeal that has made it an enduring trope in literature. As well as a temporary escape into reading, books suggest the possibility that life outside the story might also be lived differently. All these narratives embody a utopian ideal: somewhere out there, there’s something better worth beginning again for. But utopia literally means no place. There is a warning in this; set out in search of a new beginning and you may get nowhere.</p> <p>The idea of a second go at living can also create a deferred experience of life. I know this all too well. When I was growing up as a Jehovah’s Witness<strong>,</strong> looking forward to a new beginning was actively encouraged. I believed God would destroy the wicked, saving his true followers who would begin again in a paradise Earth.

Through her lack of belongings and history, Delia is able to strip back the layers of her life, discovering what matters to her. She discovers it’s never possible to fully jettison your obligations.

Ypi details her childhood love of communism: the order it brought, the sense of belonging it created. It’s only when the old regime collapses that she begins to question what freedom means, finding that often it’s the destabilising moments that create the opportunities for change. Free shows that it can take a very long time and a lot of effort to reach a new beginning.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/black-cake-9780241529928?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Black Cake by Charmaine Wilkerson</a><br></strong>An incredible family saga spanning 60 years, jumping across continents and time, forming a multi-layered book about secrets and inheritance. In the wake of their mother’s death, twins Byron and Benny are puzzled by two artefacts she leaves behind: a voice recording and a traditional Caribbean black cake. As the story unfolds the twins learn that their mother rethought her life without them, and they have to entirely reframe their idea of her. </p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/remainder-9781846884207\">Remainder by Tom McCarthy</a><br></strong>Our protagonist, his memory affected after an injury, sets out to recreate a room he thinks might have existed.

From there the entire building follows, then finally actors are called in to recreate specific moods and events that again may or may not have happened. Having lost his memory he should be free to begin again, but instead he is haunted by these fragments of the past. McCarthy creates a story about the impossibility of escaping memory as long as fragments of it remain.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dictionary-of-the-undoing-9781472154774?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Dictionary of the Undoing by John Freeman</a><br></strong>Language, Freeman argues, has been weaponised but also dulled. The Dictionary of the Undoing attempts to redefine what it means to be an ethical citizen by taking the reader through a series of alphabetised ideas leading to direct action.

In the wake of the pandemic, the continued widespread disintegration of human rights, and the tightening climate emergency, it’s a prescient book showing how language might guide us towards new beginnings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77e5af78a48f2ae0a955b2fa07361568ba78116f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77e5af78a48f2ae0a955b2fa07361568ba78116f/0_259_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Redgrave in the National Theatre adaptation of The Year Of Magical Thinking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nearly impossible new start … Vanessa Redgrave in the National Theatre adaptation of The Year Of Magical Thinking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/08/100-best-nonfiction-books-2-the-year-of-magical-thinking-joan-didion-robert-mccrum\">The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion</a><br></strong>Following the death of her husband, John Dunne, Didion takes the reader deep inside her experience of grief and the madness it brings, showing the near impossibility of moving beyond such a huge loss. Instead, as the year progresses, she becomes convinced he’ll return. All the hallmarks of Didion’s writing are here: her tightly honed eloquence, her pared back prose. It is also an eerily quiet book; grief both stalks and haunts the page. This is a new beginning that’s nearly impossible to move towards.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pew-9781783785193?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Pew by Catherine Lacey</a><br></strong>In an unnamed town, an unnamed, ambiguous narrator wakes in a church. When the townspeople discover this person, they name them Pew. Pew either refuses to or can’t speak, and this unnerving silence is a riddle people want to solve: is Pew male or female? Running away or towards something? In the absence of signifiers and explanations, Pew becomes a cipher, first a code they can’t crack, then a zero they project their fears on to. Lacey’s book examines the expectation that if beginnings aren’t to unnerve people they should be explained. It also raises questions about silence and how it’s weaponised.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-minister-and-the-murderer-9781847089236?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Minister and the Murderer: A Book of Aftermaths by Stuart Kelly</a><br></strong>A biography of murderer turned Church of Scotland minster James Nelson, The Minister and the Murderer is not only about Nelson’s reinvention but the power that books have. As it unfolds, a doubling occurs; Nelson eludes Kelly, Kelly searches for the God he abandoned in favour of atheism. It’s a book that shows the complexity of fresh starts, and asks if they’re even possible in the wake of a terrible crime. And in the case of Kelly, is his return to God a beginning or a repetition?</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/08/a-cure-for-suicide-jesse-ball-review\">A Cure for Suicide by Jesse Ball</a><br></strong>A Cure for Suicide opens with a man sitting on a chair talking to a woman. He’s only recently learned to call the chair “chair”, immediately setting the scene for a book about trauma, loss, language and the interplay of each on memory. In an attempt to erase his sadness, the woman wipes the man’s memories daily – this raises the question at the heart of the book: is it desirable to begin again? Ball never gives the reader an answer, he invites us to think. There aren’t easy answers; new beginnings can be as unwelcome as they are desirable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/29/top-10-books-about-self-improvement-anna-katharina-schaffner-the-art-of-self-improvement-new-year-resolutions\">Top 10 books about self-improvement | Anna Katharina Schaffner</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/islands-of-abandonment-9780008329808?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Islands of Abandonment: Life in the Post-Human Landscape by Cal Flyn</a><br></strong>Flyn travels to some of the eeriest places on Earth to observe how nature recovers in the wake of humans. Flyn examines what these beginnings might look like on nature’s terms. This isn’t a book about humans, and yet it becomes a hopeful one, showing our interference in the natural world doesn’t need to be catastrophic.

It’s unsurprising that such a clever idea has spread so widely, but each version has its own distinct character, and the shawarma, found from Egypt to Iraq, is quite different from the herby<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018793-pork-gyros\"> gyros</a> or the more mildly spiced, oniony döner – and different again in every country where it’s popular. The thing that binds them all together, however, is the difficulty in recreating this much-loved street food at home, if one doesn’t live in the vicinity of professionals and, unaccountably, also lacks a metre-long rotating skewer in front of a four-burner gas grill in one’s own kitchen. Happily, I’ve discovered it is indeed possible to get great results without investing in either.</p> <h2>The chicken</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"46e2bfae16f3f379c920c9f23a52b8f778eec48a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46e2bfae16f3f379c920c9f23a52b8f778eec48a/0_668_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken breast version: Joudie Kalla’s shawarma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breast is best: Joudie Kalla’s shawarma. Thumbnails by Felcity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though shawarma is also made from lamb, beef and turkey, I’ve stuck with chicken, because there seemed more than enough possibility to explore with that alone, though much the same technique could be adapted for other meats. Most recipes call for chicken thigh, with only<a href=\"https://www.palestineonaplate.com\"> </a>Joudie Kalla <a href=\"https://www.palestineonaplate.com\">(</a>who writes <a href=\"https://www.palestineonaplate.com\">in her book Baladi</a>, “who doesn’t like shawarma? It is a staple of Palestine … I adore it – as long as it’s done right”) using breast instead. My testers and I all agree that, tender as it is, it also feels a bit dry in comparison with the thigh; that said, the fatty chicken skin in<a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/chicken-shawarma-sandwiches\"> </a>Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi’s recipe <a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/chicken-shawarma-sandwiches\">on the Ottolenghi website</a> doesn’t have many fans around here, either. Much as we love crisp chicken skin, it stays a bit chewy here, and the thighs seem to have enough fat in them to keep them basted during the relatively short cooking time.</p> <h2>The spices and marinade</h2> <p><a href=\"http://yasminkhanstories.com/portfolio-item/zaitoun/\">Yasmin Khan’s book Zaitoun</a> and<a href=\"https://themanhattanfoodproject.wordpress.com/2020/03/16/michael-solomonovs-chicken-thigh-shawarma-complete-with-druze-mountain-bread-from-israeli-soul/\"> Michael Solomonov’s Israeli Soul</a> are responsible for the two simplest marinades I find: the former uses just (!) lemon juice and zest, garlic, turmeric, allspice, cumin, olive oil and pepper, while the latter eschews the lemon and garlic, but puts in cardamom and coriander instead of allspice. The Ottolenghi team adds fresh ginger and coriander, paprika, sumac and the north African spice blend ras el hanout, which generally contains Kalla’s ginger, cinnamon and sometimes cloves, though not her red onion. Like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjkkapeCX4\"> </a>Obi and Salma of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjkkapeCX4\">YouTube channel Middle Eats</a>, Kalla also calls for garlic powder – in addition to most of the spices listed above, they also pop in onion powder, smoked paprika, baharat, ground ginger, bay leaves and nutmeg.<a href=\"https://www.nigella.com/recipes/oven-cooked-chicken-shawarma\"> Nigella Lawson</a> brings bay and nutmeg to the party, and contributes some chilli flakes of her own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"011ea7f488278866a3181d2d728f5f635bdba474\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/011ea7f488278866a3181d2d728f5f635bdba474/0_390_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pack the chicken into a tin and roast: Nigella Lawson’s shawarma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pack the chicken into a tin: Nigella Lawson’s shawarma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In short, there are a lot of options in the spice department before we even address the choice of acid both to flavour and to tenderise the meat. As well as lemon juice, recipes use vinegar, sometimes in quantity: Kalla adds both white- and red-wine versions), while Obi and Salma, like<a href=\"https://www.foodrepublic.com/recipes/ultimate-chicken-shawarmas/\"> Sabrina Ghayour</a>, marinade their meat in yoghurt and also add tomato puree.</p> <p>I cannot deny that all of the above are tasty, but we prefer the less aggressively tangy examples, though we do miss the acid element in those that omit it altogether. Lemon seems a gentler option than vinegar, and garlic feels a must, though not too much, given that there will also be garlic in the sauce, and even the more robustly meaty chicken thigh is easily overwhelmed. For the same reason, I’ve kept the spicing relatively simple: the canonical cumin, coriander, turmeric and pepper, plus some sweet spices, because I love them, and Obi and Salma’s smoked paprika for a touch of fire that’s reminiscent of a charcoal grill.</p> <p>If you’re daunted by the list of ingredients, and don’t have all of them in the house, be reassured that even the simplest versions I tried were extremely good – either Khan or Solomonov’s will make you very happy.</p> <h2>The cooking</h2> <p>Spicing is, of course, a matter of personal preference; more important is how you cook the chicken. Everyone but Lawson cuts their chicken into thin strips – Kalla and Khan before marinating, Solomonov, Obi and Salma afterwards, but before cooking, and Ottolenghi and Tamimi after cooking. I find the middle approach preferable, because marinated strips take on so much flavour that the chicken itself gets lost, while cooking whole thighs means you miss out on some of the crisp edges you get from exposing more of the meat’s surface to the heat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8512692210ebf3bc64d32b45089f77c6bdf99591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8512692210ebf3bc64d32b45089f77c6bdf99591/0_466_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All the spices: Ottolenghi’s shawarma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All the spices: Ottolenghi’s shawarma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can get delicious results by packing the chicken into a roasting tin, as Lawson does, inspired, she says, by<a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017161-oven-roasted-chicken-shawarma\"> Sam Sifton’s recipe</a> for the New York Times, or by frying it, as Kalla does, or cooking it in a griddle pan, like Khan. You can mix it up by griddling the meat and finishing it in the oven, as Ottolenghi and Tamimi do, or by roasting it in a hot oven (“or air fryer, till the fat has dropped out of its skin and it has crisped up”), then slicing and frying it with more seasoning as Paul, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.iamdoner.co.uk/\">I Am Döner</a> chain, recommends. But for the very best results, I think you need to make a little more effort.</p> <p>Solomonov poaches the marinated meat, wrapped tightly in clingfilm, then chills it, slices it thinly and fries it briefly until just charred around the edges, which leaves it both tender and tasty. My favourite method, however, and not just because it involves less work, comes from Obi and Salma. As Obi says, “It’s hard to get the same texture and flavour … if your meat is in direct contact with the pan”, so their technique packs it on to ordinary skewers, as tightly as possible to keep it juicy, then puts it under the grill, “for direct heat but without any actual surface contact, to get a more authentic taste and texture”. Not only is this a one-step process, but the results genuinely taste like the real thing. It’s a stroke of genius, and I sincerely commend it to you.</p> <h2>The accompaniments</h2> <p>Once you’ve got the chicken right, it’s up to you whether you serve it over rice, stuffed into a fluffy pita or wrapped up in a paper-thin lavash – and which sauce you go for, if any. Most of the recipes I try include a tahini-based sauce, often with yoghurt, unless they’re Israeli (dairy and meat not being a popular combination for much of the population), but I’m actually more taken with<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifOlf3COK4s&amp;t=0s\"> Obi and Salma’s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifOlf3COK4s&amp;t=0s\">toum</a></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifOlf3COK4s&amp;t=0s\">, or garlic sauce – “you can’t make the sandwiches without it and to use hummus instead is a cardinal sin!”</a> – topped with a generous dollop of chilli sauce (though you could also use spicy Yemeni <em>zhoug</em>, as Solomonov, Ottolenghi and Tamimi suggest – their recipes are online).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dca0f392e4308b10d0eda37ad0ccee83b86a06ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dca0f392e4308b10d0eda37ad0ccee83b86a06ff/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity’s perfect shawarma.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity’s perfect shawarma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Accompaniments include the latter’s cucumber and red onion salsa with dill and sumac, or simple chopped cucumber, tomato and onion, but I would urge you to seek out some brined cucumbers, turnips, chillies or other vegetables to finish the dish; if you don’t have a local stockist, they’re easily found online, or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/20/pickled-turnips-recipes-get-ahead-tom-hunt\"> made at home</a>, and, for me, they finish the dish perfectly.</p> <h2>Perfect chicken shawarma</h2> <p>Prep <strong>30 min</strong><br>Marinate <strong>3 hr+</strong><br>Cook <strong>10 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>2, and easily upscal</strong><strong>able</strong></p> <p><strong>4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</strong></p> <p>For the marinade<br><strong>1 tsp ground cumin<br>½ tsp turmeric<br>½ tsp smoked paprika<br>½ tsp black pepper<br>¼ tsp ground coriander<br>2 cardamom pods</strong>, seeds removed and ground<br><strong>¼ tsp cinnamon powder<br>¼ tsp ground ginger<br>¼ tsp ground nutmeg<br>½ tsp salt<br>2 tbsp lemon juice<br>2 tbsp olive oil<br>2 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and crushed<br><br>To serve (all optional)<br><strong>Flatbreads<br></strong><em><strong>Toum</strong></em><strong> or tahini sauce<br></strong><em><strong>Zhoug</strong></em><strong> or chilli sauce<br>Brined vegetables and/or chopped cucumber, tomato and onion<br>Chopped parsley</strong></p> <p>Bash out the chicken until it’s all of a fairly even thickness.</p> <p>Put a small pan on a medium heat, then add the ground spices and toast until fragrant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfa76e528aa4d5677e750cdf185a8ea9227dd254\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa76e528aa4d5677e750cdf185a8ea9227dd254/251_1604_3252_3252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s shawarma.

After going over to introduce herself, Mannion – also an England international – discovered that the club were looking to start a new girls’ team, after their last one folded in 2018.</p> <p>Mannion wanted to help, so she gave talks in two local schools encouraging girls to sign up to the club and, also, to turn on their televisions and watch the Lionesses play at Euro 2022. What happened next, Mannion explains over the phone, was “absolutely not what we expected”. Instead of launching only one team, Davenham Juniors are poised to start three girls’ sides in September.</p> <p>“I just can’t see that that would have been the case if the Euros hadn’t been in England,” the 26-year-old defender says. “In terms of like a catalyst, and really bringing it to the forefront of people’s minds, I think the Euros has done that perfectly, especially because we won.”</p> <p>But Davenham Juniors aren’t the only women or girls’ grassroots team seeing a boost in numbers after this year’s record-breaking Euro 2022. Across the UK, grassroots clubs are reporting a boom following the Lionesses’ historic victory.</p> <p>In nearby Manchester, Ella Toone’s former club <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AandT_FC\">Astley &amp; Tyldesley</a> have experienced what Lorraine Warwick-Ellis, their head of women and girls development, can only describe as “the Tooney influence”, adding: “We’ve definitely had an increase in interest from girls. I’d say from ages 13, 14, 15 and below, it’s been a significant increase … in the under-10s age category, that’s just gone off the scale. We’ve now formed two teams at that age group, and we potentially might be forming a third.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/when-megan-rapinoe-met-ada-hegerberg-euro-2022-everyone-was-late-to-the-party\">When Megan Rapinoe met Ada Hegerberg: ‘Euro 2022? Everyone was late to the party’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Northern Ireland making a historic debut at Euro 2022, it’s perhaps unsurprising that a similar trend is being reported there. <a href=\"http://lisburn-distillery.net/\">Lisburn Distillery FC</a> – based in County Down – are gearing up to launch their first girls’ academy, which their coordinator, Donna Maxwell, says is specifically “on the back of the Euros”.</p> <p>Maxwell says: “Even just from talking to people locally, the push to get girls teams going now is massive. We never thought that we’d see the Northern Ireland team get to such a big competition and it was fantastic to see how well they did.”</p> <p>On the Football Association’s part, it has set a target to get 7,000 more women and girls regularly playing for grassroots clubs by 2024, with an overall ambition to get 120,000 more girls playing football by the same year. In the same vein, this month the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/lionesses-urge-next-pm-to-allow-all-girls-to-play-football-in-schools\">Lionesses</a> wrote a letter demanding the government ensures every schoolgirl is given the opportunity to play football. Currently, only 44% of secondary schools in England offer girls equal access to football, according to the FA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"309a2dad4fe14f5512e35b0adea15e60540a5301\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309a2dad4fe14f5512e35b0adea15e60540a5301/0_277_3761_2256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United’s Aoife Mannion (right) in Women’s Super League action against Tottenham earlier this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United’s Aoife Mannion (right) in Women’s Super League action against Tottenham earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Birmingham Yasmin Nessa, project lead at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/saltleywfc/?hl=en\">Saltley Stallions Women’s FC</a>, says her club have also seen increased interest since the tournament. “I’ve noticed that the numbers have just increased dramatically over the space of like two weeks,” she says. For Nessa, she hopes the legacy of the tournament will be to show that “women and girls can engage in football, to normalise that and change the standards around it completely, [to] change the conversation”. </p> <p>Elsewhere, in Ipswich, Kaileigh Bridges has helped <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100081771756295\">Shotley Rangers</a> to form their first girls’ side for the under-nine age group. “With every game that the Lionesses were winning, we would then, as a consequence of that, start getting random Facebook messages with parents who were asking about their girls, if there was something going for their girls to be involved in,” she says. “So it really has had a direct impact on us having a girls’ team.”</p> <p>Despite this, women and girls’ grassroots clubs often face a mountain of challenges, particularly when it comes to funding, access to facilities, and coaching staff. In Wales, Phil Butler, coach of Newport City Ladies, recently told <a href=\"https://www.thenational.wales/sport/20597764.newport-sees-surge-female-footballers-euro-2022/\">the National newspaper</a> that more grassroots funding was needed, branding the facilities in south Wales as “atrocious”. Warwick-Ellis, meanwhile, says: “We’re still struggling with female coaches stepping forward, which is a real shame because in the Euros you saw that there were a lot of coaches that were women … I think that really needs to be the next area where we start looking and getting women more involved in it.”</p> <p>For Manchester United’s Mannion, who is in rehabilitation after an ACL injury, she plans to speak in more schools in support of Davenham Juniors once term restarts. “It’s really heartwarming,” she says. “Originally, I only said that I would nip over to school and speak to them and then be on with my life, basically. But, actually, I just found myself super interested in it. I’ve got involved a lot more because it just gives me a lot of joy to think that there will be lots of girls that will have access and opportunities that, one, they should have, but also that maybe the previous generation didn’t.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/13/deportivo-guarani-copa-salta-final-indigenous-argentinian-female-footballers\">Deportivo Guaraní make football history as first Indigenous women’s team in a major final</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Quote of the week</h2> <p>England’s captain, Leah Williamson, guest edited <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0019z26\">BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour</a> last week, and thanked Sue Whyatt – who played for England’s first women’s team – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWomansHour/status/1557702117883781127\">in a heartwarming moment</a>: “I stand on your shoulders.

He said: “This is one of those issues that doesn’t really sit well on Twitter. There is an issue about the use of productive farmland for the generation of solar power.

Why do so many flaws in crypto and open-source projects fester for years?","byline":"Alex Hern","body":"<p>In February, Twitter user Brodan, an engineer at Giphy, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brodan_/status/1491091395645689860\">noticed something odd about Bored Ape Yatch Club (BAYC)</a>, the premiere ape-based non-fungible token collection. A record intended to cryptographically prove the trustworthiness of the bored apes contained 31 identical entries, a situation that was supposed to be impossible. “There’s something super-suspicious about some of your apes,” Brodan wrote.</p> <p>Six months later, when <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-sorta-kinda-bombshell?utm_source=email\">the newsletter Garbage Day brought it to wider attention</a>, Brodan’s query still hadn’t been answered. The situation is all too common in the crypto industry and the wider open-source community, and raises the question of whether there’s something fundamentally wrong with the idea that a crowd of amateurs can effectively hold large projects to account.</p> <p>The issue lies with an obscure record called the “provenance hash”. This is a record, published by BAYC’s creators Yuga Labs, that is intended to prove there was no monkey business (sorry) in the initial allocation of the apes. The problem the team had to solve is that some apes are rarer – and more valuable – than others. But in the initial “mint”, they were allocated randomly across the first 10,000 to apply. To prove they were distributed randomly, rather than a few valuable ones distributed to insiders, they published a provenance hash: a list of cryptographically generated signatures for each of the 10,000 apes, showing that the apes had been pre-generated and pre-assigned, without revealing what their characteristics were.</p> <p>So far so good, except that 31 of those signatures were identical. Since the 31 apes they were assigned to were distinct, that means the provenance record for those apes was broken – and they could, theoretically, have been changed to match the desires of the person who bought them.</p> <p>Earlier this summer I asked Yuga Labs about the duplicates, and the company initially pointed to the circumstantial evidence that it hadn’t pulled a fast one: none of the 31 apes had gone to anyone with insider connections, nor had they been generated with particularly desirable traits. Which is true – but also unsatisfactory. If you learned that your burglar alarm had never been wired up by the company that installed it, “Nothing’s gone missing, has it?” would only be a partial answer.</p> <p>When pushed, the company examined the problem further, and found the cause of the problem: when it was preparing the provenance hashes, it triggered a rate-limiting error from the server storing the images of the apes. That error meant that, 31 times, rather than generating a cryptographic signature of a picture of a monkey, the company unknowingly generated a cryptographic signature of <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/EmperorTomatoKetchup/3f9845892d9bede212df6b9dece46f59\">the error message “429 Too Many Requests”</a>.

If no one is checking these things, what’s the point? “I think in this case, perhaps the reason it went unnoticed for so long is that this is such a heavily scrutinised project to begin with,” Atalay said. “The provenance hash became a less important feature of this whole project the moment it exploded. If a single pixel had changed in the entire collection after that point, it would have been extremely glaringly obvious.”</p> <p>In that telling, provenance hashes are useful to rebut accusations of favouritism – but if there are no accusations, it’s not surprising that no one checks the hashes. Yuga Labs made a similar defence for another years-long oversight, spotted a few months ago: the company had kept control of the ability to create new apes whenever it wanted, despite promising to destroy it. Unlike the provenance hash, that ability was noticed rapidly: in June 2021, Yuga Labs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoredApeYC/status/1400218093960548364\">said they would be fixing the oversight</a> “in the next day or two”.</p> <p>In fact, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomatoBAYC/status/1534311393763241986\">it took over a year</a>. “While we’d been meaning to do this for a long time, we hadn’t out of an abundance of caution,” Atalay tweeted. “Felt comfortable doing it now. All done.”</p> <p>Such issues are by no means confined to Yuga Labs, or the crypto sector at large. Last week, Google’s cybersecurity team, Project Zero, announced the discovery of a new security vulnerability in Android. Well, it was new to them: the exploit <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-quantum-state-of-linux-kernel.html\">had already been used</a> by hackers “since at least November 2020”. But the root cause of the bug was older still, and had been reported to the open-source development team in August 2016 – and <a href=\"https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/patch/CAOssrKcfncAYsQWkfLGFgoOxAQJVT2hYVWdBA6Cw7hhO8RJ_wQ@mail.gmail.com/\">a proposed fix had</a> been rejected a month later.</p> <p>That is years of meaningful security weaknesses for almost every Android phone on the market, despite the problem being visible in the public record for anyone to see.</p> <p>It’s unclear how long that vulnerability had been present in the code, but in other situations that time can be the source of major problems. In April, a flaw was discovered in a command-line tool called Curl that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bagder/status/1516377290036420613\">had been present for 20 years</a>.</p> <p>And last December, a weakness in a logging tool called Log4j was discovered that was, <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/log4j-vulnerability-what-everyone-needs-to-know\">the National Cyber Security Centre said</a>, “potentially the most severe computer vulnerability in years”. The bug was hardly complex, and an attacker would barely have had to try before potentially taking control of “millions of computers worldwide”. But it had sat, undiscovered, in the source software for eight years. That oversight was not only embarrassing for people who believed in the security model of open-source software, but also catastrophic: it meant that affected versions of the software were everywhere, and the ongoing cleanup process might never be completed.</p> <p><strong>Tiny bugs, big problems</strong></p> <p>Open-source software such as Log4j underpins much of the modern world. But over time, the basic assumptions of the model have started to show their weaknesses. A small piece of software, used and reused by thousands of programs to end up installed on millions of computers, should have all the eyes in the world scanning it for problems. Instead, it seems, the more ubiquitous and functional a piece of software, the more people are willing to rely on it without checking. (There is, as ever, <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2347/\">a relevant cartoon from the web comic XKCD</a>).</p> <p>In a perverse way, crypto has solved some of these problems, by putting a tangible economic benefit on finding bugs. The idea of a “bug bounty” is nothing new: a large software developer like Apple or Microsoft will pay people who report security vulnerabilities. The idea is to provide an incentive to report a flaw, rather than build malware that abuses it, and to fund the sort of crowdsourced investigation that open-source software is supposed to encourage.</p> <p>With crypto projects, there’s effectively an in-built bug bounty running 24/7 from the moment they’re turned on: if you are the clever person who finds a bug in the right crypto project, your bug bounty can be … all the money that project holds. So when hackers from North Korea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/30/ronin-project-blockchain-cryptocurrency-heist\">found a hole in video game Axie Infinity</a>, they made off with more than half a billion dollars. The downside of such an approach, of course, is that while bugs are discovered quickly, the project tends not to survive the experience.</p> <p>For Yuga Labs, the saving grace is that the only people who could abuse the oversights were Yuga Labs employees themselves, who rapidly came to be seen as trustworthy enough to not worry about. But investors in the broader crypto ecosystem would be good to be wary: even if someone says they’ve published proof they are trustworthy, experience shows that there’s no reason to believe anyone has checked it.</p> <p><em>If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/jun/25/techscape-sign-up\">please subscribe</a> to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/17/the-lowry-salford-faces-tripled-electricity-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T10:24:46Z","webTitle":"Greater Manchester arts complex faces £1m energy bill this winter ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/17/the-lowry-salford-faces-tripled-electricity-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/17/the-lowry-salford-faces-tripled-electricity-bill","fields":{"headline":"Greater Manchester arts complex faces £1m energy bill this winter ","trailText":"The Lowry says energy costs in 2022-23 will far outstrip its entire Arts Council grant","byline":"Helen Pidd North of England editor","body":"<p>It could cost almost a million pounds to keep the lights on at a Greater Manchester theatre this winter as its energy bills are set to triple.</p> <p>The Lowry, a theatre and gallery complex in Salford, said it was facing a bill “substantially” higher than its £860,000 annual Arts Council grant, posing “a major challenge” for the charitable organisation.</p> <p>“Compared to the previous year we’re projecting that the Lowry’s electricity bill for the year 2022-23 will have increased threefold.</p> <p>“To give an idea of the scale of this increase, this amount is substantially more than the figure the Lowry receives annually from Arts Council England’s National Portfolio funding programme,” said the Lowry chief executive, Julia Fawcett.</p> <p>She said could not reveal the exact projected electricity cost: “As we are actively working to renegotiate contracts and suppliers, unfortunately, currently we’re unable to publicly reveal the exact figure as it is commercially sensitive.”</p> <p>Though the organisation has committed to reducing its energy consumption its energy bills will increase significantly this year, in line with national increases. “We believe this is a major challenge that will be felt across our sector,” said Fawcett.</p> <p>Named after the early 20th-century painter LS Lowry, known for his industrial scenes of north-west England, the steel- and glass-clad building only opened in October 2000, so is hyper-modern compared with many draughty old theatres.</p> <p>But it remains expensive to run, with annual building-related costs alone being £1.9m.

But raising interest rates will make it worse","trailText":"Rate hikes could induce a recession and hurt ordinary people. We need price stabilisation measures instead","byline":"Isabella Weber  and Mark Paul","body":"<p>Today American policymakers face a stark choice. Either, they can fight inflation by continuing to hike interest rates to generate unemployment and bring down aggregate demand. <em>Or,</em> they can employ a surgical approach that reins in the price increases that have been driving inflation, while encouraging investments to overcome chronic supply chain issues.</p> <p>The current inflation situation hasn’t been about all goods in the economy getting more expensive at the same rate. Specific goods – food, fuel, cars and housing – have been experiencing massive price shocks, raising the general inflation level substantially. Controlling these changes would require aggregate demand to shrink to unbearable levels for average Americans – essentially making people too poor to buy goods, and thus alleviating bottlenecks. Rate hikes are not only ill suited to bring down these essential prices but risk a recession throwing millions out of work.</p> <p>This is not only a bad choice for economic growth; inducing a recession has wide-ranging electoral and social <a href=\"https://zacharydcarter.substack.com/p/on-economics-and-democracy\">consequences</a>. The burden of the pandemic and inflation has been distributed very unequally with low-income households and Black and brown communities carrying the heaviest weight in both emergencies. Relying on rate hikes means shifting the burden once more on their backs. But there is an alternative: the <a href=\"https://bowman.house.gov/2022/8/news-rep-jamaal-bowman-introduces-emergency-price-stabilization-act\">Emergency Price Stabilization Act</a> just introduced to Congress and the Inflation Reduction Act are pointing the way in a more hopeful direction.</p> <p>To be clear, policymakers are in a legitimate bind. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/13/inflation-june-cpi/\">Inflation</a>, meaning a rise in the general price level, is hitting the American people hard, causing a real crisis for many struggling to meet their mounting bills. So far, the inflation response has relied on the Federal Reserve. The Fed continues its war on inflation, just having raised its policy rate yet again by a staggering 75 basis points. For everyday Americans, the continuation of rate hikes may not sound like big news, but it is. In fact, the Fed’s recent actions have helped push mortgage rates up nearly two <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US\">percentage points</a> since the start of the year, adding hundreds of dollars a month to average mortgage payments and placing home ownership further and further out of reach for many middle-class American families.</p> <p>But mortgage rates aren’t the only thing that is affected by Fed tightening. In fact, higher rates are akin to slamming on the economic brakes, slowing investment, often leading to <a href=\"http://jwmason.org/slackwire/inflation-interest-rates-and-the-fed-a-dissent/\">layoffs</a>, and certainly dragging <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w13428#:~:text=Of%20the%20components%20of%20GDP,in%20housing%20and%20consumer%20durables.\">down construction</a> of desperately needed new housing. In today’s economy, where much of our economic woes stem from too little investment, too few quality jobs, corporate <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/corporate-profits-have-contributed-disproportionately-to-inflation-how-should-policymakers-respond/\">profiteering</a> and international conflict, Fed tightening is not the right choice for the woes of our times.</p> <p>For the most part, policymakers have been acting like rate hikes are the only option on the table to tame inflation – in good neoliberal fashion the dictum of “there is no alternative” has ruled. But the Emergency Price Stabilization Act introduced last week by the New York congressman Jamaal Bowman would arm policymakers with tools to tame inflation and restore balance to the economy without slowing it by sacrificing workers and slashing necessary investments. (We both advised Congress on the legislation). Specifically, the legislation would expand the scope of the White House supply chain disruptions taskforce to tackle price explosions that result from supply side issues.</p> <p>It would empower the taskforce to recommend the president to utilize targeted price stabilization measures including price controls to limit price increases in systemically significant goods and services: gas, housing, food, electricity, etc. Contrary to conventional wisdom, <a href=\"https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/controlled-prices/\">price controls</a> have a rather <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2022/08/09/way-fight-inflation-without-rising-interest-rates-recession/?utm_campaign=wp_opinions&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">successful history</a> in the US when used right, and, while not a magic bullet, they are a powerful tool to tame inflation and protect low- and middle-income Americans. This is particularly true when market power – be it from landlords, oil companies or meat cartels – is at play.</p> <p>But price controls can only buy time for measures that tackle the underlying supply issues and pricing behavior. Other parts of the new act are just as crucial, including measures that would collect better data on corporate profits to determine the degree to which price gouging is playing a role in driving inflation, something <a href=\"https://www.filesforprogress.org/decks/2022/2/dfp_groundwork_inflation_message_test_feb22_deck.pdf\">voters</a>, including the majority of Republicans, already think is a significant problem. And this type of oversight isn’t far-fetched in the least. Many <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/price-gouging-state-statutes.aspx\">states already have laws </a>on the books to prevent corporations from gouging consumers during events such as natural disasters. Why not during economically tumultuous times?</p> <p>And what about those necessary investments that rate hikes would slow? Well, the act contains measures to tame inflation by doing the exact opposite: boosting productive capacity, which will ease inflation by increasing<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/opinion/supply-side-economics-democrat.html\"> supply</a>. The Emergency Price Stabilization Act not only provides an escape route from the looming dangers of a recession or even stagflation. Combined with the Inflation Reduction Act, it presents an alternative logic of economic policymaking. One that enables us to react to sectoral shocks with targeted measures while investing in the future.</p> <p>We are living in a time of overlapping emergencies – pandemic, climate change and intense geopolitical tensions all coincide. We need to be prepared for future shocks to the global flow of goods. Oil prices in the US are easing for now but the global energy crisis is far from over. Europe is preparing for historic gas shortages in the coming months. This has severe consequences not only for consumers across the Atlantic but also for global fossil fuel prices and critical supply chains such as the German chemical and machinery industries. Pushing down the whole economy whenever supply chains crumble under the weight of these emergencies is not sustainable.</p> <p>Targeted price stabilization and limits on corporate profiteering aren’t going to fix the war in Russia or the chronic underinvestment in the US economy. But they’ll protect workers and economic prosperity by providing the government with better tools to address inflation, manage corporate power and prepare the grounds for urgently needed investments. Importantly, these measures ensure Congress doesn’t sit idly by as the Fed fights inflation alone, especially in times like these when it’s simply not equipped with the resources to target the actual problems the nation is facing.</p> <p>We need more than the Fed to fight inflation and respond to price shocks. With economists finally coming around to the idea that inflation can be driven by something other than workers getting too much of the economic pie, it’s high time for policymakers to act.</p> <ul>

Her voice, mediated by her lawyers, then all but disappears, except for a few short extracts from her personal diaries and emails. It falls to her partner, J, to tell the story of the couple’s relationship and breakup. J does so in intense, repetitive prose that lurches between declarations of love, ferocious invective and counter-accusations. “I am not emotionally abusive and controlling,” J states. “I see clearly now that you have been.”</p> <p>The text refers to J as “they”, and J’s lived relationship with gender is strikingly withdrawn from the narrative. J’s wife, by contrast, is described early on as looking like “an Egyptian princess”. She is both gendered and defined almost exclusively in relation to others, as “wife”, “sis” (by her sister), or “you” (by J and lawyers). Implicitly, Is This Love? asks its readers to reflect on the role gender plays in how we judge the two parties in a bitter and unwieldy dispute.</p> <p>One person’s physical attack is another person’s scuffle. One person remembers when, locked out by their controlling partner, they phoned the police; the other recalls the officer asking quietly about the caller’s mental health. The novel becomes increasingly claustrophobic as more and more aspects of the characters’ lives are marshalled as evidence. The wife’s father is abusive, J claims, and J is distraught at the way she frames her father’s “controlling fury as the symptoms of a gentle, misunderstood and generous man”. Or perhaps it is just that J cannot bear their wife’s compassion towards someone whose flaws mirror their own?</p> <p>Describing an argument over the most intimate details of a relationship, while keeping J’s gender ambiguous, presents a significant technical challenge. The novel is successful when Riley’s approach is playful and suggestive, as when J proposes with a pendant, rather than a ring, which would be “too straight”. But in general the characterisation is out of focus, and the scrupulous approach to gender draws attention to an oversimplification of other aspects of identity, such as social class. In J’s wife’s diary, “the smell of home and the taste of [Mum’s] cooking was exactly what I needed to calm myself down. She opened a bottle of cheap red wine – I always smile when Mum brings out one of her Echo Falls or Ernest &amp; Julios – and had some with me.” The brands seem used here as a casual shortcut, placing the character on a social scale, while there is a lack of the specific tastes and smells that make this house a real home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Its subtlest effect is the way the former lovers are changed over time by the stories they tell about one another</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The novel’s subtlest effect is the way the former lovers are changed over time by the stories they tell about one another. Some way through the novel, J’s wife makes a fresh allegation against J of violent behaviour during their marriage. In a memorable and disturbing passage, J obsesses over the faults in their wife’s account of events, but as they do so, the scenario takes on a life inside their own head, and soon becomes a murder fantasy: “I knew I was being mad, and of course I was horrified by my imagining, but a part of me … also delighted in it.” J is then surprised to remember, for the first time, that their wife once hit them in the face.</p> <p>Having spent time on the page with J, I am sceptical about the sudden arrival of this memory, which seems designed to cast doubt on their wife’s presentation of her own conduct. Would I be even more sceptical if they were definitively male? I think probably I would, but it seems unlikely the novel would want to challenge that particular assumption. If the gender indeterminacy is intended to alert me to this bias, then its effects are limited.</p> <p>Is This Love? leans on its ambitious concept to provide intrigue and impetus, as it plays out a familiar narrative trajectory that goes from romance to intractable acrimony. The novel is a determined reminder that, for some couples, an unhappy, litigious process of separation can be as intoxicating as a passionate courtship. But its bold, progressive experiment with gender is diluted by imprecise, knotted language and blurred characters.</p> <p>• Is This Love? by CE Riley is published by Serpent’s Tail (£14.99).

But the backdrop of conservatives jostling for classroom censorship, and the threat of potential punishment at some point in the future can still serve as a looming threat for teachers and school administrators.</p> <p>“There is some evidence that attacks on public education have resonated particularly with conservative voters,” Young said.</p> <p>“So now, instead of attacks on public education simply being the province of people who have always fought public education for social reasons, cultural reasons, or because they support private schools or homeschooling, now there is this bandwagon effect where just about every conservative legislator feels some pressure to support or propose or vote for these bills.”</p> <p>The bills, introduced by conservative lawmakers, hardly represent public demand. More than 70% of parents are satisfied with the education their children receive, according to a 2021 <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/354083/parents-remain-largely-satisfied-child-education.aspx\">Gallup poll</a>. Earlier this year a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/04/29/1094782769/parent-poll-school-culture-wars\">NPR survey</a> found that fewer than 20% of parents are dissatisfied with the way their children are taught about gender and sexuality, and race.</p> <p>Missouri has had the most gagging bills in 2022, but Florida has had more success in passing legislation, Young said.</p> <p>In March, Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, signed a bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/dont-say-gay-bill-florida-ron-desantis\">dubbed “don’t say gay”</a> into law. The heavily criticized legislation restricts instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, while the state also passed a law which <a href=\"https://time.com/6168753/florida-stop-woke-law/\">places restrictions</a> on discussion of race and racism. Separately, DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/florida-ron-desantis-communism-bill-students\">signed a law</a> in May which orders that students must receive at least 45 minutes’ instruction every November about the “victims of communism”.</p> <p>Young said the legislation is often characterized by the banning of vague concepts, rather than providing specifics about what teachers can and cannot say and teach.</p> <p>Florida’s don’t say gay bill, for example, <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/1557/BillText/er/PDF\">reads in part</a>: “Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”</p> <p>Classroom instruction is not defined, and as the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/us/dont-say-gay-bill-florida.html\">noted</a>, it could mean “eliminating books in the classroom with LGBTQ+ characters or historical figures”. Similarly, no guidance is given on what “classroom discussion” actually means, and could be interpreted by teachers to mean, as the Times put it: “A student with gay parents should not talk about those families with the entire class.”</p> <p>“The vagueness is the point,” Young said.</p> <p>“Because the vaguer the bills are, the more self-censorship is going to go on, the more afraid teachers will be, and the more afraid administrators will be.</p> <p>“So it is absolutely by design – it is the plan to get teachers and administrators on the defensive, to get them on their toes, to make it so that they don’t go anywhere near potentially prohibited concepts.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/new-york-city-is-owed-500m-in-parking-fines-no-one-is-paying-up","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T10:00:13Z","webTitle":"New York City is owed $500m in parking fines.

They haven’t been fined for selling anything illicit, but for being top contributors to one of the city’s other infamous scourges: illegal parking.</p> <p>The New York City department of finance confirmed to the Guardian that Weed World Candies had paid $200,000 in parking fines to get back several vehicles that had been towed in June by the city’s sheriff’s office.</p> <p>But while Weed World is apparently getting on the right side of the law, its payments only equal a fraction of the $534.5m the city is owed in unpaid parking fines, according to the agency, as serial offenders skirt the rules in one of the world’s most maddening places to get around.</p> <p>In Midtown Manhattan, where competition for parking is cutthroat in a grid of cramped and chaotic roadways, trucks habitually stop in bike lanes, forcing cyclists into busy traffic; cars double-park as drivers sprint into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/05/new-york-bodegas-love\">bodegas</a> to buy their increasingly expensive <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-chipotle-bodega-food-menu-prices/\">bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches</a>.

But many of their owners never pay: a <a href=\"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89/explore\">public database</a> of New York City parking and camera violations over more than two decades lists over 3m unpaid fines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/new-york-cars-free-covid-open-streets\">New York banished cars during Covid – could its open streets be preserved?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like Weed World Candies – whose trucks mostly sport Alabama plates – some of the most flagrant individual offenders are registered out of state. It’s an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/03/nyregion/living-here-but-registered-there-new-yorkers-dodge-high-fees-with-state-license.html\">open secret</a> that many of these vehicles belong to New Yorkers trying to dodge fees, taxes and high insurance premiums. The city has fewer tools to pursue these vehicles.</p> <p>According to the data, one of the biggest scofflaws is a white refrigerated truck with Indiana plates that has racked up $139,920 in unpaid fines, for parking in bike lanes, bus lanes, crosswalks and more. Another white refrigerated truck with Minnesota plates has run up $126,355 in unpaid fines, for violations including repeatedly parking in bike lanes and double parking in Midtown Manhattan.</p> <p>It’s perhaps no surprise that that New York’s closest neighbor, New Jersey, has amassed the most unpaid New York City traffic fines of any other state: $172.2m, according to public data. (Pennsylvania is second, with $89.4m.) But cars from states much farther away – Texas and Florida – rank next, with about $35.8m in unpaid tickets each.</p> <p>The worst individual offenders aren’t from any American state at all, but are foreign diplomatic vehicles. According to city data, the all-time worst offender is an Egyptian diplomatic car that has racked up $223,265 across 1,983 unpaid tickets. (Vehicles whose license plates contain Egyptian diplomatic country codes have accumulated a whopping $2,014,944.14 in fines.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8553b2b539e61b2971559ed09f271cb626c5803d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8553b2b539e61b2971559ed09f271cb626c5803d/0_882_5382_3229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"black SUV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A car with a diplomat license plate gets a parking ticket on the Upper East Side.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taidgh Barron/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indonesian diplomats are also big offenders, running up a $770,663.85 tab, with the top offender single-handedly contributing $56,325 in unpaid tickets.</p> <p>And amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, locals protested when journalists found that Russian diplomats had ignored more than <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/investigations/i-team-russia-owes-new-york-city-101000-for-unpaid-parking-tickets/3625370/\">$100,000 in traffic fines</a> (that number is now down to $97,414.03, data shows).</p> <p>According to a finance department spokesperson, Jacqueline Gold, diplomatic vehicles owe a total of $15.7m in parking fines. The agency “works with the US state department to collect unpaid parking tickets from diplomatic vehicles, which are generally exempt from booting/towing”, Gold said. The state department has said that it prevents the registration or renewal of diplomatic license plates for cars with multiple unpaid violations.</p> <p>In 2019, a New York <a href=\"https://www.osc.state.ny.us/state-agencies/audits/2021/03/23/selected-aspects-collecting-outstanding-amounts-due-parking-violations\">state comptroller’s report</a> found that the city was insufficiently aggressive in going after unpaid parking tickets and argued officials should make more of an effort to collect fines from New York-registered vehicles. In one sample, out of 153 unpaid fines worth $2.2m, the finance department only took action in 35 cases, the report found. A pattern of inaction means many cases have fallen outside of the New York’s eight-year statute of limitations for parking tickets, costing the city millions of dollars.</p> <p>After the pandemic hit, the then mayor, Bill De Blasio, suspended booting and towing for all vehicles – that policy only restarted this May. In 2021, a new state law <a href=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/politics/2021/06/30/driver-s-licenses-will-no-longer-be-suspended-for-unpaid-fines\">ended the practice</a> of suspending drivers’ licenses for unpaid fines, which advocates said disproportionately punished poor drivers.</p> <p>But a significant amount of illegal parking by wealthy operators is officially sanctioned – and even subsidized. Under a controversial New York City policy called the stipulated fine program, corporations among the city’s biggest parking offenders may prepay their tickets for a hefty discount, if they agree not to contest the fines. That in effect allows hulking delivery trucks to idle in prohibited zones with the city’s blessing. A <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/cgi-park2/2019/02/how-does-the-city-collect-parking-fines-from-delivery-companies-and-other-businesses/\">2019 report</a> from the city’s independent budget office found the 10 companies with the most discounted parking fines, including UPS, FedEx, Verizon and Time Warner Cable, got more than $20m worth of discounts combined in a single year.</p> <p>Critics say the program sends the message that parking fines are just the price of doing business – which is the logic that Weed World apparently followed as its trucks stopped in “no standing” zones, camped in front of fire hydrants, and double-parked on some of Manhattan’s busiest streets, according to city violations data.</p> <p>The fines were just a “natural byproduct” of having trucks in the big city, the Weed World owner, Bilal Muhammad, told <a href=\"https://www.audacy.com/1010wins/news/local/weed-world-pays-up-usd200k-in-nyc-parking-ticket-debt\">local reporters</a> this week. He blamed the tickets on contractors, who he said let the tickets “get out of hand”.</p> <p>Ironically, for New Yorkers, the real crime is the trucks’ marketing: while Weed World looks and feels like a mobile dispensary – covered in cannabis leaves and selling lollipops like “strawberry kush” – it doesn’t actually sell marijuana products. The trucks mostly sell legal drug-free candy.</p> <p>On Yelp, where the company has a one-star rating, a local resident, Jasmin G, complained last December that she had spent $20 on a “useless” pre-rolled joint that left her unsure if she was high at all.</p> <p>“It’s disappointing to see these carts littering the city with the intent of scamming anyone who chooses to give them business,” she wrote. “They should absolutely be shut down.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/17/bob-marshall-wilderness-mules-trails","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"Keeping it wild: how mules help preserve the last untamed places in the US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/bob-marshall-wilderness-mules-trails","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/17/bob-marshall-wilderness-mules-trails","fields":{"headline":"Keeping it wild: how mules help preserve the last untamed places in the US","trailText":"If it’s got gears, it’s not allowed in Montana’s Bob Marshall Wilderness.

But there’s freedom to be found there. Wanting to witness it myself, I contacted the <a href=\"https://www.bmwf.org/\">Bob Marshall Wilderness Foundation</a>, a non-profit that coordinates volunteer groups of public land stewards. Veteran mule packers sign up to train the next generation so traditional skills can be passed on.</p> <p>I called their program director, and asked if I could tag along.</p> <p>“Do you know how to ride a horse?”</p> <p>“Not really,” I answered, sheepishly.</p> <p>“Well,” she said, “you better take lessons then.”</p> <p>So I did.</p> <h2>‘Stubborn’</h2> <p>Mules have a long list of superpowers – it’s no wonder their nickname is “the four-legged Jeep”.</p> <p>Because they’re the progeny of a male donkey and a female horse, they benefit from what is known as hybrid vigor, which makes them hardy and disease resistant. They’re sure-footed on uneven terrain, have exceptional peripheral vision and a gait that allows them to carry loads better than other stock animals. They are steady, covering on average three miles an hour. Those attributes make them uniquely suited to long hikes – or “hitches”, in the packing parlance – in the Rockies.</p> <p>They also tolerate heat exceptionally well – for decades, mules were put to work in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/historyculture/twenty-mule-teams.htm\">Borax mines</a> of California’s Death Valley, where temperatures climb as high as 125F (51C) in the summer months. And they have a storied history of being<a href=\"https://happycampnews.com/mule-teams-assist-firefighters/\"> first in line to help</a> put forest fires down.</p> <p>As I listened to their joyful clunking and stared at the line of long fuzzy ears ahead of me, I couldn’t help but think that mules are also quite endearing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbc36fba7960f08d1c3eb59677a99bf5dfb78a72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc36fba7960f08d1c3eb59677a99bf5dfb78a72/0_396_5319_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A packer leads a string of mules to Cabin Creek Station.

The mules carry a week’s worth of supplies for trail volunteers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mackenzie Reiss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Frank Vitale, the 70-year-old veteran packer who lets me tag along, mules are the perfect pack animals. He particularly respects their intelligence, memory, and instinct: when faced with danger, they usually stop and think, while horses tend to spook or bolt.</p> <p>He’s keen to highlight the fact that, contrary to stereotype, mules are not stubborn; they just have a strong sense of self preservation. A joyfully biased book <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Natural-Superiority-of-Mules/John-Hauer/9781634507868\">called The Natural Superiority of Mules</a> explains it: “A horse can usually be intimidated and forced to do things that he perceives to be senseless or potentially harmful. However, a mule may become ‘stubborn’ when asked to exceed her capacity to perform.” (This is why the Oregon trail was littered with the bodies of horses who were pushed past their limits, yet the same did not apply to mules.)</p> <p>Frank moved to Montana from New Hampshire 45 years ago because he wanted to see the west. While rugged and more capable than most of us – he wears leather chaps made from an elk he killed himself – there’s an undeniable hippy vibe to him. He often laments how disconnected we are from the natural world. Without a connection to something bigger than us, he believes, we will end up losing ourselves.</p> <p>Preserving the west’s packing heritage, then, acts as a vaccine protecting the wilderness, with traditional skills as gatekeeper against modern forces (helicopters, heavy machinery) that knock the door open for more destruction.</p> <p>Frank is keen to pass down his knowledge to the next generation – and the clock is ticking.</p> <p>This is where Demi Sullivan comes in. At 29, she is one of two apprentice packers this year. A former rafting instructor, she’s used to standing her ground in a world that tends towards the masculine, navigating big muscles and bigger egos. She radiates competency and none of the backbreaking work seems to phase her.</p> <p>She wakes up at 5.30am and doesn’t stop until the check list is complete. She lifts 70lb hay bales without batting an eyelid, and doesn’t expect you to be surprised at her strength either. As I watch her wrestle with a stubborn mule, I decide I wouldn’t want to take my chances against her in a bar fight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35923c6f2802e25ebc7faf371ad69fabfbd30821\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35923c6f2802e25ebc7faf371ad69fabfbd30821/0_318_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mule is loaded with gear at Cabin Creek Station in preparation for a 14-mile journey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mule is loaded with gear at Cabin Creek station in preparation for a 14-mile journey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mackenzie Reiss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She and Frank make a strong team: he’s firm but attentive, and never patronizing. He lets her take risks so she can learn, trusting her to lead the entire mule string.</p> <p>If the next generation of mule-packers face one hurdle, it’s financial.</p> <p>First, you need land. This might have been easier decades ago, but decent acreage is now out of reach for most young people. A single working mule costs thousands of dollars. A decent saddle goes for $1,500. A farrier needs to re-shoe the animal every eight to 10 weeks, which will set you back around $120 each time. And of course you need hay, and a lot of it. With the west being in a constant state of drought, feed prices are becoming unaffordable.</p> <p>Those who keep their eyes on the prize will find a way to make it happen, with a bit of luck. They will continue to apprentice for free; trade or barter; put every single penny they have aside to provide a good life for their animals. All this, for the privilege of crossing a terrain rarely seen by most Americans. For a taste of freedom and self determination, and the comfort that comes with the belief that you are capable of handling yourself and your stock come hell or high water.</p> <h2>An exercise in trust</h2> <p>You do need to have a lot of grit to work in the backcountry. Packing, I learn quickly, is not a job for impostors.</p> <p>When I attend a mule packing class at the historic Nine Mile Ranger station near Missoula earlier this spring, I hear plenty of intimidating stories. A person was bitten on the shoulder so hard that it tore open their muscle. Another got kicked in the face and had to be helicoptered out of the backcountry. A ranger referred to his many kicking scars and bruises as his “mule tattoos”.</p> <p>A mule’s head alone weighs more than 200lb. If you’re unlucky enough to stand in its way, you can kiss your front teeth goodbye. One second is all it takes for a mule to knock someone flat; a single kick to your leg can break bones.</p> <p>The only way to avoid a worst-case scenario, explains lead packer Robin Connell, is to always keep safety in mind and build a relationship with your animals. Packing is a conversation, an exercise in trust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F7186dd73b34fa5546533acb2ac88f7bdfacf0e84%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4024_6048&amp;left-caption=A%20volunteer%20holds%20a%20crosscut%20saw.&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F83c651abed9f5c30258026c766b416219c953a8c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4024_6048&amp;right-caption=Freshly%20sawn%20fir%20logs.%20Photography%3A%20Aaron%20Agosto&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"No mechanical equipment is allowed in the Bob. \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F7186dd73b34fa5546533acb2ac88f7bdfacf0e84%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4024_6048&left-caption=A%20volunteer%20holds%20a%20crosscut%20saw.&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F83c651abed9f5c30258026c766b416219c953a8c%3Fcrop%3D0_0_4024_6048&right-caption=Freshly%20sawn%20fir%20logs.%20Photography%3A%20Aaron%20Agosto&always-place-captions-below=false\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>This point is brought home to me very quickly on my first hitch. As Demi leads the string of mules and cajoles the pack into crossing a waterfall on a sharp trail turn, one of the mules trips. I hold my breath as I watch the animal struggle to find its feet, wondering if it is going to tumble down the cliffside to its death.</p> <p>The mules behind do an immediate U-turn and start running towards Frank and me, who were at the back of the pack. Mayhem ensues, and the only reason no mule or human was injured isthat the animals came to their senses and trusted the team to calm down and keep going.</p> <p>We eventually manage to complete our mission: to pack material and food for a group of five trail volunteers.</p> <p>The trail volunteer is composed of a ragtag group of fresh-faced 19-year-olds, all of whom can talk about climate change with more passion and clarity than most politicians.</p> <p>One of them, Isaac Slevin, explains their week so far: they widened and evened out 525 yards of trail by carving into the mountainside with pulaskis and picks (remember, no mechanical tools allowed), starting at 6am each day. They also used handsaws and crosscut saws to clear fallen trees. On a good day, they can clear 70 small trees; on a difficult day, they stand in front of an imposing 2ft-wide one, which guarantees a very sweaty morning of hard labor.</p> <h2>An escape from the modern world</h2> <p>There’s another benefit to packing up your life for a few days in the backcountry on top of mules: perspective.</p> <p>At 88 years old, after spending an estimated <a href=\"https://americancowboy.com/lifestyle/smoke-elsers-fire/\">22 years of his life</a> sleeping outdoors, Smoke Elser, the uncontested titan of the packing world, is now begrudgingly retired. During his career, he taught Navy Seals and FBI agents how to work efficiently with mules to track fugitives in remote landscapes, or in war zones. (Mules were widely used by the Allied forces during the first and second world wars, and some were sent to Afghanistan by the US in the war against the Soviet troops in the 1970s and 1980s.)</p> <p>Still, Smoke worries packing will soon become a lost art – and for this reason, cannot seem to stop teaching. He helps host a wilderness and packing <a href=\"https://www.evamaggi.com/teaching/university-of-montana/\">class</a> led by Eva-Maria Maggi at the University of Montana.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4a142a8c80b723abde9f5d638bf8ee48b77eb7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4a142a8c80b723abde9f5d638bf8ee48b77eb7d/0_396_6048_3628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Call of the wild: the Mission Mountains.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Call of the wild: the Mission Mountains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Agosto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frank says that to be able to break away from technology for days at a time is critical to his sanity. “When I get too old to put my foot in the stirrup and swing into the saddle,” he<a href=\"https://www.gravel.org/2013/07/20/frank-vitale-thoughts-of-a-wilderness-traveler/\"> once said</a>, “I’m going to make one request: just wheel me up to the edge of the wilderness so I can look in one more time to a place and a time where I found true freedom.”</p> <p>Likewise, Smoke argues that traversing the wild country “helps us escape from the fast pace of our modern world, with its mania for efficiency”. When<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiw3xAFy6V8\"> asked</a> once what advice he would give young people to live a good life, his answer was simple:</p> <p>“Pack up a sleep bag, and get with somebody who’s been [in the backcountry] lots of time, man or woman. Go on a trip with them with a horse, and listen to their life story,” he said.</p> <p>“Then take another trip by yourself, and have a vision. Go sit by a big ol’ ponderosa pine, a stream or on top of a rocky mountain, and just think: what am I gonna do with the rest of my life? This is just the first day of the rest of my life. No better place to do with nobody around, no beep beep beep of the telephone … Just you.”</p> <p>Perhaps going slow is all the medicine the world needs right now.</p> <p><em>• The Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex is located on the ancestral lands of the Amskapi Piikani (the Blackfeet Nation of Montana), the Niitsítapi (the Blackfoot Confederacy), the Séliš (Salish), Ql̓ispé (Pend d’Oreille or Kalispel), and Ktunaxa (Kootenai) tribes.</em></p> <p><br><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/17/brooklyn-beckham-career-high-profile","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"Brooklyn Beckham’s ever-evolving career path is a balm in our dark times | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/brooklyn-beckham-career-high-profile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/brooklyn-beckham-career-high-profile","fields":{"headline":"Brooklyn Beckham’s ever-evolving career path is a balm in our dark times ","trailText":"At 23, he’s had three callings already. To what high-profile profession will Beckham Jr next be drawn, asks Guardian columnist Marina Hyde","byline":"Marina Hyde","body":"<p>Can the most blatant nepotism sometimes add to the gaiety of the nations? It depends. In the old days, the eldest son of British notables might be sent out to rule as Proprietor of the Province of Maryland, which feels less than ideal, while other scions were elevated to administer 50,000 square miles of India on the basis they were both clubbable and semi-adequate lower order batsmen. Hand on heart, however, I cannot fault the state of the art system of turd-polishing that gifts Brooklyn Beckham a hilarious new career once a year. In these straitened times, I simply do not wish to deprive myself of the amusement. I have hugely enjoyed every single one of the high-profile professions thus far embraced by Brooklyn, 23 – <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/romeo-beckham-brooklyn-beckham-football-24910382\">footballer</a>, <a href=\"https://theartgorgeous.com/breakdown-brooklyn-beckhams-photography/\">art photographer,</a> <a href=\"https://heatworld.com/celebrity/news/brooklyn-beckham-new-book-see/\">published monograph author</a>, <a href=\"https://heatworld.com/celebrity/news/victoria-beckham-model-superdry-collection/\">model</a>, and now <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/digital/features/brooklyn-peltz-beckham-cook-instagram-food-1235336663/\">chef</a>. Is there nothing he can do?</p> <p>If there is, I am sure none of us wishes to find out about it. Where was I, before the eldest son of David and Victoria Beckham was being promoted into the sidebar of my consciousness thrice weekly with a series of impossibly gilded professional ventures from whose comic implosion he seems able to move onwards and ever upwards with consummate ease? Wherever it was, it wasn’t a very happy place. And like I say, the fact that Beckham Jr is typically offered a brand ambassadorship as opposed to an <em>actual</em> ambassadorship feels like progress of a sort in our septic isle. Better a sponsored cleansing regime than an ethnic cleansing regime.</p> <p>A full rundown of the more priceless career ventures would be impossible, but special mention must be made of the Penguin Random House collection of Brooklyn’s photography, which featured iconic images such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alicevjones/status/878254329689276416?lang=en-GB\">an elephant</a> taken against the light so that only the background could be clearly discerned, glossed by the self-penned caption, “elephants in Kenya. so hard to photograph but incredible to see”. Or perhaps you prefer the blurred one of a restaurant dinner: “i like this picture – it’s out of focus but you can tell there’s a lot going on.” A launch party at Christie’s London would accompany the work’s publication.</p> <p>This week, Brooklyn graces the cover of Variety’s Young Hollywood issue, despite in no sense being part of what we’d call Hollywood. According to the <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/digital/features/brooklyn-peltz-beckham-cook-instagram-food-1235336663/\">cover headline</a>: “Brooklyn Peltz Beckham, Heir of Britain’s Other Royal Family, Has Instagram Eating Out Of His Hand.” Does he? No idea, darling. He certainly has 14 million followers, and we are informed that last Valentine’s Day, he and his new wife Nicola Peltz “baked heart-shaped pizzas in a Vogue video that’s been viewed more than 3m times”.</p> <p>At present, Variety insists that Brooklyn is “eye[ing] a food empire”, which – if the accompanying interview is anything to go by – currently consists of Brooklyn making fish and chips for the interviewer in a random cottage on his billionaire father-in-law’s estate in Mount Kisco, NY, to which he has puttered up by golf cart from one of the grander bits. Brooklyn only has to discard two tries at battered fillet before producing something he feels he can serve to the magazine’s emissary, and still have the journalist get back to the office without food poisoning so he is able to file the article. A tiny part of me wonders whether any chef throwing away two versions of fried fish before he got one that conformed to basic food safety standards would be something of a red flag, but I fully salute the interviewer’s spiritual constitution as well his physical one. “We had this idea,” reveals our serial innovator, of why he and his new wife are now known as the Peltz Beckhams. “We kind of combined our last names. I was just like, oh, we could start a new thing … ” So yes, you have to have a pretty strong stomach to swallow lines like that and not give them both barrels. Double barrels. Whatever.</p> <p>But it’s not just botched fish suppers for Brooklyn. “His longer term dreams are even more entrepreneurial,” we learn, “and he hopes to use television to ensconce himself in the food world.” Or, indeed, food to ensconce himself in the television world. “I’ve always said to my wife,” says Beckham Peltz, “we should actually do a reality TV show, because she’s so funny.” Go on. “I want to have so many TV shows, and hopefully one day open up a pub in LA, because LA needs a pub.” The interviewer drops that “while he won’t share specifics, he is planning to launch a branded product ‘in the sauce department’ later this year”.</p> <p>Naturally, there will be those who wonder at Brooklyn’s inability to have what other mortals might regard as amateur hobbies without considering them nascent professional empires. It does seem likely to be linked to having grown up in a family where even private downtime is tirelessly packaged and commercialised. Whole acres of the Beckham parents’ social media feature supposedly intimate moments shared with millions. You know the sort of thing – Victoria addressing her husband and daughter via her Insta with a photo and caption along the lines of “Love you so much Daddy and Harper! Kisses!”. I’m certainly not questioning the expression of love, merely the efficiency. After all, if one did wish to unleash a term of endearment on the child sitting right next to one on a yacht, surely the most efficient way to do so is to simply turn to that child and deliver it vocally, rather than typing it into Instagram, editing it, scaling it, then mediating it via Facebook’s server farms and one’s 30m followers?</p> <p>This, perhaps, is the context in which a hobby at which you are no more than tenuously adequate feels like a potential empire. “I found what I absolutely love to do a little later in my life,” explains Brooklyn, 23, “but I absolutely love it.” As for the previous professional callings, “I was still trying to find that one thing I would literally die for, and I found that with cooking.”</p> <p>It seems unlikely to come to that – and shortly after this declaration, Brooklyn grabs a bottle of beer and pootles back off to the big house in his golf cart. No doubt there’s already some joyless Martin Luther out there, who will one day nail his 95 theses on some Instagram wall and demand that the practice of celebrity nepotism be ended immediately. Until then, I am absolutely here for Brooklyn’s latest incarnation, and whatever next year’s turns out to be. Has he not entertained us?

Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steve Walker, from Rochdale, who turns 52 next week, says he felt well respected and fulfilled in his job as head of the humanities and history departments in a secondary school. “Teaching was always what I wanted to do, but around the time I turned 50 I just decided that all my career goals and ambitions had been hit,” he says.</p> <p>When the pandemic shifted the focus of his job to “box ticking and accountability”, he began feeling overwhelmed. “Suddenly I was just struck by how my life was controlled every second by the tyranny of bells, timetables, examinations, terms and deadlines. I felt fatigued, anxious and depressed.”</p> <p>After being diagnosed with long Covid in March and three months’ sick leave, Walker took the decision to resign for good.</p> <p>“This profession was who I was, for nearly 30 years. I was surprised at how little the decision impacted me, apart from a feeling of guilt at leaving my colleagues and students mid-year,” he says. “Now, I look forward to having more control over my life. I won’t be going back.”</p> <p>Walker says money is “obviously” a concern, but he and his wife hope they can manage by embracing a simpler lifestyle and reducing their “economic footprint”.</p> <p>“We are in the process of selling our oversized three-bed ambition house, paying off all our debts and settling in a small cottage in Argyll, Scotland. I have secured a volunteer guide role at the local museum and plan to rediscover all my ignored hobbies,” he says.”</p> <p>“I have told my wife that I’ll go and stack shelves in a supermarket if we’re short of cash one day. I think I did make a difference. But now it’s time to make a difference to my life.”</p> <h2>‘At some point I’ll have to earn money again’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b7539e311ff83a8c3c0762917b1b148ac4aba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b7539e311ff83a8c3c0762917b1b148ac4aba9/0_0_757_1009/750.jpg\" alt=\"Kirsty MacCulloch\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kirsty MacCulloch, 52, says she never thought she would shelve her career until she did.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty MacCulloch/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kirsty MacCulloch, from Surrey, decided to stop looking for new employment after she was made redundant from her management job in international recruitment in 2020.</p> <p>“Now, I’m funemployed [sic] and taking some time to work out what I want to do when I grow up,” the 52-year-old says. “I’m re-reading all my books, I’m volunteering with a community kitchen and a charity, I’m sorting my garden out, practising recipes, catching up on streaming and spending time with family and friends.”</p> <p>Financially she is lucky, she says, having saved up a lot by not going on holiday for 10 years as she often travelled for work.</p> <p>“The only thing that will make me return to employment is the increase in the cost of living. I’m not able to draw a pension yet and the annual budget I had planned to carry me through has been blown away by price rises, so won’t be enough to get me to pensionable age,” she says.</p> <p>“But I’ve realised work isn’t the be and end all, that there are other ways to get rewarded – although five years ago, I’d never thought I’d do this.”</p> <h2>‘There were no flexible jobs I wasn’t overqualified for’</h2> <p>For Deborah, 55, from Gloucestershire, it was primarily the pressure of juggling childcare, housework and her career that made her leave her part-time job as a copywriter during the pandemic.</p> <p>“I suddenly had no support system any more. My now 12-year-old was at home for two years as I was shielding, the house was a mess when I came home. I was exhausted,” she says. “I now just do about 12 hours a week, freelance.”</p> <p>Deborah says she emotionally disconnected from her workplace when she stopped commuting into her London office, but did not take the decision to quit lightly.</p> <p>“My partner works but I don’t really like working less, and think I should be able to work as I want to – it’s a feminist issue for me. But there still isn’t that kind of support around to meet basic childcare and health needs.”</p> <p>Despite the UK’s labour shortages she has found it impossible to find part-time, flexible work in more senior positions, she says.</p> <p>“But overall, I also feel that I want to do more valuable things with the remaining time of my life. I may run as a local councillor, for instance. I think the pandemic has made many people reconsider their priorities, and I just can’t see us, as a society, going back to being driven by work.”</p> <h2>‘I should have done this a decade ago’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19fd6adf6548aa56e7a9aa3dcb86e8c595f00f03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19fd6adf6548aa56e7a9aa3dcb86e8c595f00f03/0_0_1440_1800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Robinson in her garden\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Robinson in her garden, which she rediscovered during three months of furlough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Robinson/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarah Robinson, 50, from Birmingham, used to enjoy working as a supplier development engineer in the automotive industry, before she handed in her notice in early 2021.</p> <p>“It’s basically the best thing I’ve ever done, I should have done it 10 years ago,” she says. “I spent 24 years working in an office, and I really liked my job. But once I started working from home and didn’t sit in traffic for two hours every day, I realised I didn’t have a good work-life balance.

But basically … this has been a historical fact for decades. Essentially, it’s partly a mindset and attitude thing, I think. It’s working culture, basically. If you go to China it’s quite different, I can assure you.”</p> \n<p>She said there was a “fundamental issue of British working culture”, and that if the UK wanted to be “richer and more prosperous” then that would need to change.</p> \n<p>“There’s a slight thing in Britain about wanting the easy answers,” she said. “That’s my reflection on the election and what’s gone before it, and the referendum – we say it’s all Europe that’s causing these huge problems … it’s all these migrants causing these problems.

But the US president has greeted this “hot streak” in his usual quiet fashion. For his predecessor, it was a decidedly rough week after his home was raided by the FBI, looking for official documents that Donald Trump had held on to after his presidential term had ended. The reaction was a typical explosion of rage and accusation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a>, our Washington bureau chief, follows this compare-and-contrast theme to see which of the two men, who at this juncture still look likely to face each other again in the 2024 presidential election, came out on top.</p> <p>We report on two anniversaries in one region<strong> </strong>this week as Monday marked 75 years since the Partition of India, as well as a year since Afghanistan returned to Taliban rule.

As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/margaret-atwood\">Margaret Atwood</a> writes on our Opinion pages, attacks on writers are a cheap populist distraction, while on the news pages we look at how Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses triggered hatred against him.</p> <p>Leading our features section this week is a story about a reversal in reputation. Peru-based writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-collyns\">Dan Collyns</a> explains how Bolivian tin baron Moritz Hochschild, had been viewed as an exploitative oligarch until the discovery of a cache of papers revealed his role in saving thousands of Jews from Nazi Germany and how he used his power to overcome antisemitism in the ruling elites. And then we take a full and frank look at the growing popularity of naturism in Britain.

Here, insiders reveal how the industry really works","byline":"Sirin Kale","body":"<p>We have long lived in the age of paparazzi, yet the public in general is ignorant about the reality of how these images are created. Many people believe that freewheeling photographers happen<em> </em>to stumble across reality TV stars working out in full makeup, or musicians walking very slowly to their cars outside five-star hotels, or soap actors frolicking in the surf in Dubai. What the public does not see: the paparazzi who go on holiday with celebrities; the agents who have paparazzi on speed dial; the paparazzi who give a cut of their income to the people they photograph.</p> <p>But recent months have seen the paparazzi thrust, blinking and unwilling, into the spotlight. In the recently concluded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/rebekah-vardy-loses-libel-case-against-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie\" title=\"\">“Wagatha Christie” libel case</a>, text messages were submitted to the court in which Rebekah Vardy and her former agent Caroline Watt discussed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimwaterson/status/1526592237605425156/photo/1\" title=\"\">tipping off the photo agency</a> Splash News about the arrest of the footballer Danny Drinkwater, as well as arranging for a paparazzo to photograph – without their consent – a group of footballers’ partners leaving a restaurant <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/rebekah-vardy-staged-wag-pap-26209145\" title=\"\">during the 2018 World Cup</a>. (Splash News and Backgrid are the leading photo agencies in the industry, responsible for most of the images sold into newspapers and magazines.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, the public mania for paparazzi shots continues to grow. In January, the pop star and beauty entrepreneur Rihanna announced her pregnancy with a set of staged photographs <a href=\"https://people.com/parents/rihanna-pregnant-expecting-first-baby/\" title=\"\">showing her walking with her boyfriend</a>, the rapper A$AP Rocky, in Harlem, New York City. In March, the internet went into a paroxysm of nostalgia when Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jul/26/why-is-the-photo-of-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-on-a-yacht-so-compelling\" title=\"\">recreated a scene</a> from Lopez’s 2002’s music video Jenny from the Block for the benefit of a conveniently positioned photographer with a long-lens camera. In June, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were snapped looking like a nightmare in neon while filming the much-awaited Barbie film on Venice Beach, Los Angeles.</p> <p>“I think a lot of people are quite dumb to how it works,” says the Manchester-based paparazzo <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/parfittpictures/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Aaron Parfitt</a>. “People think we are scumbags hanging out of trees. But these celebrities are ringing us.” He estimates that 80% of his shots are set up in advance. “I’ve been on holiday with celebrities,” says Parfitt, 22. “Most of them are reality stars. We go to Spain, shoot six bikini sets and stick them out throughout the month.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d66243b683ce02590db275f6516acdd224a799\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7d66243b683ce02590db275f6516acdd224a799/0_0_6200_4135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebekah Vardy at the high court in London on 12 May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Under the spotlight … Rebekah Vardy at the high court in London in May for the ‘Wagatha Christie’ trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A culture of omertà prevails. “No one wants to talk about it,” says Malin Andersson, a 29-year-old influencer and <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/Superpower\" title=\"\">mental health podcaster</a> from Bedfordshire. “But I have done it. I openly admit to that.” After leaving Love Island in 2016, she routinely posed for arranged shots. “It was so fucking weird,” she says. “I’d pretend to be on my phone. I felt so awkward doing it. But then it became a norm.”</p> <p>Fellow Love Island alumna <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rachel.finni/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Rachel Finni</a>, 30, remembers the moment she was inculcated into this secret practice. She was having dinner with a minor celebrity, having just left the show. “He said: ‘I am going to text the pap guy.’” Finni was confused. “He said: ‘Honey, paps only come if you call them!” Over the next few months, she routinely let paparazzi know her plans. “Seeing yourself in the papers and magazines every other day is the most incredible feeling,” she says.</p> <p>Finni and Andersson are not alone. “When you come off Love Island, you have a year to cash in until the next season,” says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/viewsbyjesal/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Jesal Parshotam</a>, 32, a paparazzo who works in London and LA. “The people who make it are the ones who are regularly appearing on MailOnline. Love Island<em> </em>people go out to be photographed. They have their guy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b8f39a9030ca8fcca83bccb555b08f15a6a14f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b8f39a9030ca8fcca83bccb555b08f15a6a14f1/0_0_1171_1497/782.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna with her favourite paparazzo, Miles Digg.\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rihanna with her favourite paparazzo, Miles Digg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SplashNews.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not only lower-tier stars who contact paparazzi routinely. “Kim Kardashian has a unique relationship with the paparazzi,” says Emily Rose, whose pop culture podcast <a href=\"https://itsbecomeawholething.podbean.com/\" title=\"\">It’s Become a Whole Thing</a> dissects the relationship between celebrities and paparazzi. Kardashian has admitted to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/15313892/kim-kardashian-admits-super-desperate-famous-seek-out-paparazzi/\" title=\"\">seeking out paparazzi</a> when she was up-and-coming; she is understood to work with favoured photographers.</p> <p>Rihanna has a close relationship with the paparazzo Miles Digg, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZcrsnuvnr4/?hl=en\" title=\"\">who shot her pregnancy reveal photos</a>. “He is trusted,” says Parshotam. “She’s worked with him for over 10 years. If we’re in a crowd of 10 photographers, I’ve seen her stop and hug him.”</p> <p>Whether A-lister or otherwise, the reason that celebrities notify paparazzi of their whereabouts is the same. “It’s an exposure game,” says Chad Teixeira, the chairman of the celebrity PR firm <a href=\"https://www.daddytheagency.com/\" title=\"\">Daddy the Agency</a>. “It’s about keeping relevant.” Teixeira often contacts paparazzi on behalf of his clients. “What everyone has to remember is that everyone is just doing their job,” says Teixeira. “Celebrities need paps to promote their profiles. Papers need celebrities to earn an income. One can’t exist without the other.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13e02139d02fa1911a2ba13feaedc912f9348d35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13e02139d02fa1911a2ba13feaedc912f9348d35/212_0_3075_1846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Celebrities can’t be seen to be working with paps’ … Aaron Parfitt, a Manchester-based paparazzo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Celebrities can’t be seen to be working with paps’ … Aaron Parfitt, a Manchester-based paparazzo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For lower-tier celebrities, being papped regularly helps them to increase their social media following and secure brand work. Higher-tier celebrities are papped while on promotional tours for their latest project. “A common trope is famous people who are usually fairly reclusive suddenly being photographed every day canoodling with their new love, who happens to be a co-star in their movie,” says Rose. Other times, paparazzi are used to rehabilitate a celebrity’s public image after a controversy. “I know one high-profile footballer who’d had an affair,” says Parshotam. “He organised pictures of him holding hands with his family, to take the heat off the story.”</p> <p>If the public has a basic understanding of paparazzi, it goes something like this: paparazzi are the cruel men, usually bald, who hounded Britney Spears to a breakdown. “I was definitely a part of that,” says 53-year-old Giles Harrison, an industry veteran who lives in LA. “That was one of the darker times in the industry.” As such, paparazzi are commonly despised. “We’re hated more than traffic wardens,” says Jaimie Harris, 31, a paparazzo turned picture editor from Essex. “People used to shout at me: ‘You killed Princess Diana!’” In her decade-long career, Harris saw much reprehensible behaviour. “High-speed chases,” she says. “All of us would go through red lights.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59a321a2aa64ddcc294733380b5b99b7eb9bd1e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59a321a2aa64ddcc294733380b5b99b7eb9bd1e1/0_0_4320_3252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giles Harrison at his office in Venice Beach, Los Angeles, in 2011\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘That was one of the darker times in the industry’ … Giles Harrison, pictured at his office in 2011, on the hounding of Britney Spears.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reed Saxon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The period 2004 to 2016 was a “golden era”, Harrison says. “That’s when we were making more money than we knew what to do with.” His company generated about $1.5m annually in picture sales. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry\" title=\"\">the Leveson inquiry</a> heard evidence in 2011 from witnesses including Sienna Miller, who said she was spat at and verbally abused by photographers, and JK Rowling, who said that paparazzi targeted her daughter’s primary school. But most paparazzi insist that the bad old days of Spears, Lindsay Lohan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/28/leveson-inquiry-press-police-politicians\" title=\"\">Charlotte Church</a> et al being taunted and harassed are in the past. “When people think of paparazzi, they think of that Britney Spears gold rush era,” says Parshotam. “But that photography was disgusting and doesn’t exist any more. We are all against it.”</p> <p>With the advent of social media, margins have been squeezed. Newspapers and magazines are less willing to pay for photographs when they can lift them from Instagram for free. Celebrities unhappy about being papped can upload an image of themselves on to social media, killing the value of a paparazzi photograph. While photo sets of rarely spotted A-listers still sell for tens of thousands of pounds, mostly paparazzi make no more than a few hundred pounds at a time. “I know so many people who are giving it up or struggling,” says Harris.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’ve been on holiday with celebrities. We go to Spain, shoot six bikini sets and stick them out throughout the month</p> <footer> <cite>Aaron Parfitt</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because there is less money at stake, paparazzi have calmed down. “It’s not the feeding frenzy it once was,” says Harrison. “When people can get tens of thousands of dollars for a shot, it can make people bloodthirsty.” That is not to say that intrusive behaviour does not take place. While Parshotam says he wouldn’t take someone’s photo if they asked him not to, Parfitt and Harris have done so. “I think if you’re following someone, doing covert pictures out and about, that’s fair game, even if they don’t know you are there,” says Harris. “That’s what paps are there to do. We’re there to take pictures.”</p> <p>Many A-listers have reached an accommodation with the people who take their images. “Celebrities understand the benefits of it now,” says Parshotam. Harrison agrees. “It’s a lot less adversarial. As much as people overtly seem to dislike the paparazzi and the product, behind the scenes, people like it and embrace it.” This is not to say that all A-listers call the paparazzi on themselves. As a rule of thumb, the more famous someone is, the less likely they are to do this, although there are high-profile exceptions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"709a6f055e36b8980f942c85fb4a93aa21816b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/709a6f055e36b8980f942c85fb4a93aa21816b80/0_0_3000_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lindsay Lohan outside court in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Golden era’?

I made sure there were none of her looking bad, none with her eyes closed.”</p> <p>The A-listers who aren’t OK with paparazzi? Adele. Prince Harry. David Beckham. Woman-of-the-moment Coleen Rooney varies, says Parfitt. “If you get her on a good day, she doesn’t mind,” he says. “On a bad day, she tells you to fuck off.” Those who want to avoid being papped know to avoid notorious celebrity hangouts such as Carbone in New York or Chiltern Firehouse in London. “The people who want to be seen will be seen,” says Harris.</p> <p>By contrast, celebrities desperate to stay newsworthy may resort to degrading antics. In 2016, Parfitt photographed a former Big Brother contestant posing naked on Blackpool beach. “She messaged me on Twitter and said: ‘I have an idea. What if I go skinnydipping on Blackpool Beach?’” he says. “I picked her up and she went on the beach and started stripping off and rolling around in the sand.” The images went viral. “She loved them. It got her back in the press, put it that way.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When people think of paparazzi, they think of that Britney Spears gold rush era. But that photography was disgusting</p> <footer> <cite>Jesal Parshotam</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But other celebrities grow tired of the hamster wheel. “You’d be going to events just to get papped,” says Andersson. “That’s how sad it was. And so was everyone else. The next day, you’d look at the Mail to see if you were on there and you’d feel inadequate if you weren’t.” When flashes start to illuminate other, fresher talents, the sense of loss can be crushing. “Seeing myself in the Mail gave me validation, but it was empty validation. Because the article would drop down in five minutes and you’d want the next one. It becomes a bit of an addiction and you start chasing it more.”</p> <p>The issue with inviting paparazzi to photograph your life, says Finni, is that you start to think of every<em> </em>aspect of your life, even your darkest moments, as monetisable moments. “You see people who have gone through traumatic events who are in the Mail the next day,” she says. “You think: you’re going through something so disturbing, but you called someone to come to take a picture of you?<em> </em>Where do you lose the sense of value of your own privacy? What message are you giving out to people who follow in your footsteps, in terms of stepping into the spotlight?” Andersson and Finni no longer arrange paparazzi shots. “It doesn’t do anything for me, but to remind people I exist,” says Finni. “And how does it benefit me to remind people I exist? It’s so empty.”</p> <p>Everyone in this ecosystem is required to perform a complicated charade. Celebrities pretend they haven’t contacted paparazzi; photographers accept the public’s dislike as a necessary price for doing their job. “I’ve had people walking past going: ‘Leave them alone!’” says Parfitt. “And I’m thinking: they <em>rang</em> <em>me</em> to shoot these pictures<em>. </em>But celebrities can’t be seen to be working with paps. So they have to say: ‘It’s fine – I’m used to it.’” They partake in this unholy dance because it is considered unforgivably gauche to seek fame, rather than to stumble upon it en route to another destination. “We hold our hands up and say: ‘It’s set up,’” says Harris. “It’s the celebrities themselves who are embarrassed about it.”</p> <p>The public partakes in this collective denial, too. As much as we heckle paparazzi in the street and pontificate about the invasion of privacy, we consume these images voraciously. Indeed, the market wouldn’t exist without customers. Harris says: “People moan: ‘Leave them alone!’ but they’re the ones looking at the pictures.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/17/ten-glaring-inconsistencies-in-scott-morrisons-bamboozling-press-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T09:27:38Z","webTitle":"Ten glaring inconsistencies in Scott Morrison’s bamboozling press conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/ten-glaring-inconsistencies-in-scott-morrisons-bamboozling-press-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/ten-glaring-inconsistencies-in-scott-morrisons-bamboozling-press-conference","fields":{"headline":"Ten glaring inconsistencies in Scott Morrison’s bamboozling press conference","trailText":"While attempting to explain why he appointed himself to five ministries in secret, the former PM raised more questions than answers","byline":"Amy Remeikis","body":"<p>In Scott Morrison’s mind, he did nothing wrong by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/former-australian-prime-minister-scott-morrison-pm-secretly-gave-himself-five-ministerial-roles\">awarding himself the powers</a> of the health, finance, treasury, home affairs and resources portfolios like some sort of ghostly understudy. He did what he had to do, and he saved Australia. That was the gist of his hour-long Wednesday press conference. But as always there are inconsistencies, half answers and questions which remain, despite the bluster. Here are the most glaring.</p> \n<h2>1. He can’t recall – or can he?</h2> \n<p>On Tuesday morning Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2022/aug/16/i-dont-recall-scott-morrisons-2gb-interview-about-secret-ministry-appointments-as-pm-video\">told Sydney radio 2GB he couldn’t recall</a> appointing himself to any other ministries, beyond the health, finance and resources roles which had been reported.</p> \n<p>Ben Fordham: Are there any other portfolios you assumed any control over?</p> \n<p>Scott Morrison: “Not to my recollection, I am pursuing that, but not to my recollection.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/morrison-government-failed-to-provide-priority-for-at-risk-groups-in-vaccine-rollout-report-says\">Morrison government failed to provide priority for at-risk groups in vaccine rollout, report says</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was revealed that same day Morrison had also sworn himself into the home affairs and treasury portfolios.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, not only did Morrison have a full recollection of what happened, he went into great detail – on how it was done, why he did it, and why he believed it necessary.</p> \n<p>“I only did it particularly in portfolios of significant areas of importance, ie treasury and home affairs, because there were unilateral decision making powers of ministers. After we had gone through the initial phase and the pandemic was continuing, we took the precaution to put those in place in these other important portfolios where there were unilateral decision-making powers on ministers that were not subject to cabinet.”</p> \n<p>(He said “we” but he meant “me”.)<br></p> \n<h2>2. ‘I didn’t tell anyone so they wouldn’t be distracted’ – apart from those people I told</h2> \n<p>Morrison said he didn’t tell the ministers he was haunting their portfolios because he didn’t want them to be distracted from their day-to-day duties.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t disclose it to them because I didn’t think it was for the best operation of the government during a crisis for which I am responsible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"460a3947e468a75d0a815e8eb3dd3a0a4af55a6b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/460a3947e468a75d0a815e8eb3dd3a0a4af55a6b/0_6_6048_3628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison at press conference \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison says he didn’t tell ministers he was taking over their portfolios as it could ‘undermine the confidence of ministers’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flavio Brancaleone/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>“</strong>I did not want any of my ministers to be going about their daily business any different to what they were doing before. I was concerned that these issues could have been misconstrued and misunderstood and undermine the confidence of ministers in the performance of their duties at that time.”</p> \n<p>But in one of his first answers, Morrison said he had told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/scott-morrison-faces-probe-over-secret-ministry-claims-as-government-seeks-legal-advice\">his health minister, Greg Hunt</a>, and thought his finance minister, Mathias Cormann, had also been told and it was a mistake that he wasn’t.</p> \n<p><strong>“</strong>We were dealing with extra powers, new powers enlivened under the Biosecurity Act and talking with Greg [Hunt] and how we would mapping that new set of powers, then we had that discussion. My honest recollection was that there’d been a communication between offices in relation to the minister for finance, that didn’t take place. I accept that, and I have apologised to then minister Cormann … ”</p> \n<h2>3. Good government relied on no one knowing he had these powers in reserve, but it was OK to tell two journalists writing a book about it</h2> \n<p><br>Morrison repeatedly said no one, other than some inside his department, Greg Hunt (and he thought Mathias Cormann) and the governor general, knew about the arrangement of him being sworn in to additional portfolios.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/scott-morrison-minister-for-everything-and-nothing-and-there-was-a-lot-going-on\">Scott Morrison – Minister for Everything and Nothing and There Was a Lot Going On | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There was a great risk that in the midst of that crisis those powers could be misinterpreted and misunderstood, which would have caused unnecessary angst in the middle of a pandemic and could have impacted on the day-to-day functioning of the government.”</p> \n<p>But at the end of his press conference, he freely admitted having told the two journalists writing the book Plagued, Simon Benson and Geoff Chambers, at the time.</p> \n<p>“I have no interest in the book, I have no commercial interest in it whatsoever, but I cooperated with interviews that were done contemporaneously. That book was written based on interviews that were conducted at the time, in the middle of the tempest.”</p> \n<h2>4. Trust everyone and also no one</h2> \n<p>Morrison said he trusted his ministers to exercise their powers. But he only took on portfolios in which ministers had unilateral power to make decisions without cabinet. He trusted his ministers to make decisions in the national interest, except where he didn’t.</p> \n<p>“I am pleased that through the course of the pandemic my confidence was in them to keep just doing their job. Now, the fact I didn’t interfere in doing their job shows the confidence I had in them.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb8aff5ce1da438f1031194fe691ed756a1fab8e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb8aff5ce1da438f1031194fe691ed756a1fab8e/0_155_4750_2850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The fact I didn’t interfere in doing their [ministers’] job shows the confidence I had in them.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Saphore/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But what about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrison-accused-of-bias-in-blocking-pep11-gas-project-using-extraordinary-ministerial-powers\">Pep-11 and the blocking of a gas exploration licence</a> off the coast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales\">New South Wales</a> ?</p> \n<p>“I wanted him [Keith Pitt] to continue doing the job as the minister but on that particular project I believe it was in the national interests for me to consider it in its totality which I did and I’m very happy with that decision and if people think I should have made a different decision and allowed that project to proceed and allow the drilling to occur off the New South Wales coast, I don’t agree with it.”</p> \n<h2>5. It was all about the pandemic – except where it wasn’t</h2> \n<p>Morrison said (with the exception of Pitt’s portfolio) the “safeguards” he took were all about the “unprecedented” circumstances the pandemic had created.</p> \n<p>Which might explain the first two ministries he was secretly sworn into in 2020. But it doesn’t explain why he decided to add resources, home affairs and treasury to his list of powers in 2021, given the nation had a much bigger handle on what to expect from the pandemic.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In explaining how it slipped his mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/josh-frydenberg\">to tell the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg</a>, about adding treasury to his list of portfolios, especially given the pair were playing pool, eating curries and watching Yes Minister together at The Lodge in July 2021, Morrison says there were bigger things going on than the pandemic.</p> \n<p>“Now at that time we were also putting the budget together for that year, and in addition to that I was in the process of negotiating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/20/australia-almost-no-chance-to-buy-any-submarine-from-current-us-building-program-experts-say\">the Aukus arrangement</a> with the United States and the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>“So, there were other issues that, frankly, had a much higher priority and these matters were added to the emergency powers on an administrative basis.”</p> \n<h2>6. Co-administering or not co-administering</h2> \n<p>Morrison made it clear that he thought anyone who was exercised over what he had done just didn’t understand. He wasn’t “co-administering” those portfolios. Except that is exactly what <a href=\"https://www.pmc.gov.au/news-centre/government/instruments-scott-morrison-2020-21\">the instruments released by the prime minister’s department</a> said he was doing.</p> \n<p>“I was not co-administering … the suggestions of co-administration of departments is 100% false. I was administratively sworn in which gave me authority, like many other ministers had, to exercise decisions in an emergency situation.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9de17b6a5077c877a80d09d18edee3ee6c0e773\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9de17b6a5077c877a80d09d18edee3ee6c0e773/0_0_1254_1634/767.jpg\" alt=\"The official document showing former prime minister Scott Morrison was appointed to administer the departments of Home Affairs and Treasury\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The official document showing former prime minister Scott Morrison was appointed to administer the departments of Home Affairs and Treasury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong><br></strong></p> \n<h2>7. A safeguard for everyone … except the prime minister</h2> \n<p>The reason Morrison needed these powers was as a “safeguard” (there is that word again) in the case of an emergency and that minister was incapacitated. But if Morrison was incapacitated, he would have used the normal processes to delegate his authority to the deputy prime minister. Because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/defiant-scott-morrison-resists-pressure-to-resign-defends-secret-portfolios-as-necessary\">Morrison needed emergency powers</a> “just in case”, but that same urgency apparently didn’t apply to an incapacitated prime minister.</p> \n<p>“The deputy prime minister was the back up to me. I mean, I assign when I’m prime minister to the deputy prime minister before I went on leave or something like that … and he acts as prime minister.”</p> \n<p>So why do it in advance for the other ministers?</p> \n<p>“It might be puzzling but that may be as a result of not having walked in my shoes and understood the urgency and the nature of the circumstances at the time. You’re standing on the shore after the fact. I was steering the ship in the middle of the tempest.” </p> \n<h2>8. Power for power’s sake</h2> \n<p>People expected him to have powers, so he granted himself more powers he didn’t use.</p> \n<p>“I believed it was a prudent, responsible action in the middle of a crisis to have those emergency powers in place to ensure that I could exercise the expectations of my responsibilities, which I remind you was put to me on a daily basis by members of the media, by the opposition, constantly telling me that I was responsible for everything … So this is something I dealt with every day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc40513acdd34436a2c97ffd11a4e26fa5d7d931\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc40513acdd34436a2c97ffd11a4e26fa5d7d931/0_319_4880_2928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘… the media, by the opposition, constantly telling me that I was responsible for everything.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Saphore/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“The expectation was created of that responsibility, and I made sure that I was in a position to act should I have to and thank goodness that was not necessary, and I think this is a point that is being overlooked.”</p> \n<h2>9. Maybe the governor-general asked Morrison to make the powers public, maybe he didn’t – whatever you think, you would be wrong</h2> \n<p>Morrison would not give a straight answer as to whether the governor general had asked him to make his extra portfolios public.<br><br>“You’re asking me to go into conversations between me and the governor general which I am not going to do.</p> \n<p>Reporter: So we assume you did.</p> \n<p>Morrison: “No, you can’t assume anything … I am not going to be verballed, or bullied in this press conference by you trying to put words in my mouth.</p> \n<p>“You can assert nothing about that. You can impugn nothing about it because if you did so then you would err.”</p> \n<h2>10. Process is suddenly important, when it comes to disclosure</h2> \n<p>Morrison would not disclose if he was paid to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/26/scott-morrison-ditches-parliaments-return-to-speak-at-japan-event-not-starting-until-thursday\">attend the conservative former leaders conference in Japan</a> – which he missed parliament for – when asked, because that is not the process. This, in an hour long press conference defending why he threw away process and secretly appointed himself minister for additional ministries.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/the-cognitive-dissonance-of-scott-morrisons-defence-is-mind-boggling\">The cognitive dissonance of Scott Morrison’s defence is mind-boggling | Sarah Martin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I’ll make all the necessary disclosures under my register of interests as you’d expect me to do as previous members of parliament have done.”</p> \n<p>Q: Why don’t you do so now?</p> \n<p>“Because that’s not the process for how it’s done in parliament.

It’s a major assault on one of the fundamentals of our democracy. Ministers have enormous power and get to make decisions that affect people’s lives and get to spend money. Many of those decisions are made behind closed doors. We are entitled as the public and as parliamentarians to know who the ministers are who are making decisions that affect us.</p> \n   <p>And we’re trying to hold these ministers to account, asking them questions in question time, holding them to count for decisions they’ve made. I find the mental principle behind that is you’ve got to know who the minister is. Who is making the decision? That is why prime ministers stand up in parliament and table lists of who the ministers are.</p> \n   <p>It turns out what Scott Morrison was telling us in parliament about who was responsible was wrong. He knew things he knew were wrong. He was telling the parliament something completely different and telling the public something completely different. If this was such a great idea of his, why didn’t he make it public?</p> \n   <p>I think the issue should concern people right across the country, and concern people across the political spectrum in parliament, because you have someone making an unprecedented decision, coming up with all the justifications in the world for it, but keeping it secret and he was the prime minister.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ee929986c44519a345fdad4747960c73315abbe\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ee929986c44519a345fdad4747960c73315abbe/3069_1385_5073_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Bandt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian Greens leader Adam Bandt.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T07:12:22.202Z\">at 8.12am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fc8b3a8f083e25be0ebd74\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T06:34:56.396Z\">7.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Clare O’Neil unconvinced by Scott Morrison’s explanations</strong></p> \n  <p>Minister for home affairs, <strong>Clare O’Neil</strong>, says she is “absolutely not” convinced by Scott Morrison’s explanation for his secret portfolios.</p> \n  <p>Speaking on the ABC earlier, O’Neil first criticised Morrison’s performance at his press conference:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This was vintage Scott Morrison.

worker pay floor would ‘kill immigration overnight’: business chamber</strong></p> \n  <p>The head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, <strong>Andrew McKellar</strong>, has spoken to the National Press Club about the upcoming jobs and skills summit.</p> \n  <p>Unions have given conditional support on increasing migration to 200,000, but warned employers must first lift pay before seeking foreign workers. They want the salary floor for temporary skilled migrants lifted to average full time weekly (about $91K), and indexed to the wage price index.</p> \n  <p>McKellar said wages should be “a question for the marketplace” and “many businesses” are lifting wages to attract workers. McKellar said the wage price index only measures the “standard remuneration employees are getting” and did not show that employees are getting pay rises through “changes between jobs”.</p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The idea here we need some sort of artificial mechanism or checkpoint before we start responding to the crisis that we have is not the right notion ... The threshold, the income threshold, before a business can access the immigration [system] – [unions] want to increase that from the current level of $53,000 a year to $90,000 a year.

So in that way, for quite significant decisions like that, under the Biosecurity Act, it was like a two-key process and that provided a safeguard and I think that was sensible.

And that was to deal with some of these - these problems of lack of back-up powers or reserve powers or emergency powers if circumstances required it and we sought to make do and do the workarounds that enabled us to put those things in way. In the Biosecurity Act, I think it’s worthwhile for departments and the government to look at what we did and see whether that is something they think they should be put in place in the future and I think all of these processes hopefully will help inform should, God forbid, the country be put in this sort of situation again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T03:47:28.914Z\">at 4.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fc5b7d8f08b9fd3e4e00c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T03:08:20.756Z\">4.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Q: Did anyone in your cabinet know that you were home affairs and treasury minister?</p> \n  <p>Morrison: “That’s already been answered.

flagged this week, the last time this number landed was during the federal election campaign, and the WPI’s 2.4% annual increase reminded many that wages were more likely going backwards given that March quarter consumer prices had risen a surprising 5.1%.</p> \n  <p>Three months on, we have a new government and a looming <strong>jobs and skills summit</strong> at the start of September – and today’s wages number will no doubt feature in the debate.</p> \n  <p>The median forecast is the quarterly WPI will have risen to 0.8% from 0.7% in the previous three months (CBA notes that latter figure was rounded up from 0.65%). On an annual basis, the number will likely land at about <strong>2.7%</strong>. Even with a bit of movement either way, the increase will be well shy of the 6.1% inflation increase in the quarter.</p> \n  <p>Now the WPI doesn’t capture all of the movements in salaries, such as bonuses. Still, the Reserve Bank of Australia expects real incomes to continue to shrink for most.

Huntsmen complained of terrible accidents resulting from their horses vaulting the unexpected wire, while members of the House of Lords <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/1893-05-08/debates/7618f3c1-681b-4243-9f9f-982d24930179/BarbedWireFencesBill\">railed that</a> “nothing was more calculated to destroy the amenities of country life”. What reason was there, asked Lord Thring in 1893, “why a child wandering along the roadside picking cowslips and blackberries should be liable to have its hands lacerated and its clothes torn by these fences?”</p> <p>Today, barbed wire is an accepted feature of the countryside; a misanthropic aberration faded into the background of daily life. It is the symbol of a sick culture that fetishises private property rights at the expense of all that is good, humane and beautiful. That’s why I and others have taken to mass trespass.</p> <p>Until two years ago I kept thoughts about the exclusion of the public from so much of the nation’s land to myself. They remained a dimly expressed irritation as I shuffled through the public footpath turned spiked gauntlet into town. Or when I snatched a glimpse of my local river – almost entirely private – where the landowner had strung barbs across the body of the water itself, dispiriting the view. I ground my teeth at the nearby council sign enjoining litterers to “Keep the Town Beautiful”. It was pinned to a fence of razor wire. <br><br>Then I read an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/09/forgive-us-our-trespasses-forbidden-rambles-with-a-right-to-roam-campaigner\">interview</a> with Nick Hayes, author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/10/the-book-of-trespass-by-nick-hayes-review-a-trespassers-radical-manifesto\">The Book of Trespass</a>. Trespassing is, Hayes argues, a mostly benign act undertaken by those whose imagination chafes against the narrow confines of property law. Trespassing is portrayed as antisocial, but what could be more antisocial than the Keep Out sign and the lacerating wire strung up to reinforce it? The real crime is not the wanderer, it’s the fence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7495aeb0c29f9c65bb2810ab290f3e19f9353cc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7495aeb0c29f9c65bb2810ab290f3e19f9353cc2/0_408_540_324/500.jpg\" alt=\"Barbed wire and fence along the River Monnow, on the Welsh border\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The real crime is not the wanderer, it’s the fence.’ Barbed wire and fence along the River Monnow, on the Welsh border</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Moses</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I realised my life had been lived under the shadow of a coercion I had neither the frame to acknowledge nor the language to describe. And with that came a more powerful realisation: that coercion was in my head. Despite the feint of a thousand signs warning the contrary, and <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5802/cmpublic/PoliceCrimeSentencing/memo/PCSCB15.htm#:~:text=Part%204%20of%20the%20Police%2C%20Crime%2C%20Sentencing%20and,Criminal%20Justice%20and%20Public%20Order%20Act%201994%20%28CJPOA%29.\">Priti Patel’s best efforts</a>, trespass alone <a href=\"https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/trespass-and-nuisance-land\">is not a criminal offence</a>. So long as I damaged nothing and did not obstruct anyone, I could roam. Not with rights, perhaps – but with confidence all the same.</p> <p>I called an old schoolfriend for an unlikely caper. What if we pretended we lived in Scotland for a day, where the right to roam has been enshrined in law since 2003? What might we do? The answer seemed obvious – finally get to know the river.<br><br>We didn’t get very far – barbed wire, it turns out, <em>is </em>some deterrent – perhaps 5km upstream and 5km back. And yet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jm0ses/status/1428353977310011393\">a new world </a>was opened to me. I discovered a beautiful spot a 10-minute cycle from my house, an old estate where the river is lined with mature ash. I’ve laid in it for hours since, watching dippers and kingfishers scoot past at frog’s eye view. <br><br>Connecting to the river also meant I started to look after it. I started to rummage around the local weir to collect the agricultural rubbish that gets trapped there. I’ve invested in a phosphate reader to start testing the river quality. Yes, sometimes the public drop litter too. But the flipside of disregard is guardianship.</p> <p>Something else emerged, as well. The river ceased to be a mere backdrop to my life and instead became one of its central players. My mind would drift with its eddies, the water coursing fresh channels through my neural pathways. The river began to shape me, and I came to see that we have lost more than just access: we have lost the chance to belong.</p> <p>Since formally joining the Right to Roam campaign, I’ve escalated my ambitions. I and 50 others <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jm0ses/status/1555215645528264704\">hopped the wall</a> of the 52,000 acre Badminton estate in Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke of Beaufort. Days later, I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/07/trespassers-demand-right-to-roam-12000-acre-estate-englefield-richard-benyon\">jigged</a> towards the deer park of the 13,000 acre Englefield estate in Berkshire, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/07/trespassers-demand-right-to-roam-12000-acre-estate-englefield-richard-benyon\">accompanied by more than 100</a> musicians, artists and dancers. Both events were positive and lighthearted, but it was hard not to feel anger, too. I thought of my friends, exploited landworkers priced out of the counties in which they grew up, living without a hope of affording so much as one acre. Yet it is precisely their knowledge and skills we need if we are to turn Britain’s ecological crisis around.<br><br>Englefield is owned by Lord Benyon, who, without a hint of irony, is also the minister in charge of the English public’s access to nature. Both Benyon and Beaufort receive hundreds of thousands of pounds of <a href=\"https://theecologist.org/2022/aug/08/baron-land\">public subsidy</a> to manage their land. They’re less keen that the public visit what they pay for. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/07/how-the-aristocracy-preserved-their-power\">Over a third</a> of the land in England remains in the hands of aristocratic estates like Badminton and Englefield (the real figure is likely much higher but unknown). The elite culture represented by such places continues to be preserved through public largesse. Meanwhile, much of the popular culture of the countryside has been lost to repeated centuries of enclosure.</p> <p>No more. It’s time to end the farcical privatisation that has left <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/09/why-trespass-is-a-radical-act\">92% of England</a> off limits to the public (and a whopping <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jm0ses/status/1557791864870297600\">97% of its rivers</a>). Right to Roam calls for people to respectfully explore the land hidden on their doorstep.

I have to be the person I am.”</p> <p>While Will Young stood out for talking back to Simon Cowell during the show, it was Darius who turned down Cowell’s post-Pop Idol offer of a record deal with BMG, one that came with the caveat of having to record various cover versions.</p> <p>“Imagine, I could have done a cover of Gareth’s cover of Robson and Jerome’s cover of the Righteous Brothers,” he said. “How great! You know, that doesn’t inspire me.” Instead he signed to Mercury Records and co-wrote his 2002 debut album, Dive In, with the likes of Steve Lillywhite (The La’s, Travis) and The Matrix (Avril Lavigne, Ronan Keating). Across two big-label albums Darius scored five UK top 10 singles without ever releasing a cover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6086988de22c67c503ba93cbc67347532c6d725b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6086988de22c67c503ba93cbc67347532c6d725b/0_8_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Paice (Scarlett O’Hara) and Darius Danesh (Rhett Butler) in Gone With The Wind at the New London Theatre in April 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jill Paice (Scarlett O’Hara) and Darius Danesh (Rhett Butler) in Gone With The Wind at the New London Theatre in April 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Glasgow to a Scottish mother and Iranian father, Darius eschewed the stage school route in favour of grandstanding performances in avant-garde operas (he’d later return to opera after winning 2010’s Popstar to Operastar). Switching then to pop in a restrictive TV talent show format often meant he couldn’t quite be contained, with even his post-rejection monologue to his Popstars rivals coming across like a scenery-chewing, gloriously passionate sermon. </p> <p>“It’s just not our time, that’s it,” he mused, surrounded by tearful faces. “We’ve all got talent. How much love is there in this room? I feel so much energy from your guys. There’s nothing to lose from this.” Aware, perhaps, that fame’s 15 minutes were ticking down, Darius relished his status as the country’s most famous tryer, appearing on multiple covers of Heat magazine. </p> <p>But, crucially, there was always a sense he knew the game he was playing. As Lucie Cave, the editor in chief of Heat magazine and the Heat brand, put on Instagram in tribute: “He really got the joke and always had a wry smile whenever he answered questions about being a serious musician.”</p> <p>A key part of the Darius story arrived during Popstars via a promise he made to the judge “Nasty” Nigel Lythgoe. On his way out of the show, the then 21-year-old calmly announced he would have a platinum album by the time he was 35. That it wouldn’t be the last Lythgoe would hear from him. </p> <p>Years later this kind of bravado on the shows that followed would ring hollower than a Louis Walsh compliment. But for Darius, it was something he was going to make happen. Even Lythgoe felt it. “Darius is a survivor in life,” he said on the show. “And Darius will do whatever Darius has to do to survive. And it wouldn’t surprise me if Darius does get a platinum disc in the next five years.”</p> <p>By the end of 2002, Darius had scored a UK No 1 with the Radio 2 classic Colourblind, landed a top 10 album and was briefly rivalling the established soft-pop dominance of Ronan Keating and Robbie Williams. That he then went on to write a Sunday Times bestseller (2004’s memoir Sink or Swim), appear in multiple West End productions (including Chicago and Gone with the Wind), and become a Hollywood producer is testament to a journey from tryer to survivor to established success story quite unlike any we’ve seen in TV talent show history.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/17/hate-mail-unofficial-bans-and-super-bowls-the-long-journey-of-the-black-qb","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"Hate mail, unofficial bans and Super Bowls: Long journey of the Black QB","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/hate-mail-unofficial-bans-and-super-bowls-the-long-journey-of-the-black-qb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/17/hate-mail-unofficial-bans-and-super-bowls-the-long-journey-of-the-black-qb","fields":{"headline":"Hate mail, unofficial bans and Super Bowls: Long journey of the Black QB","trailText":"In his new book, Jason Reid looks at the often painful – and sometimes triumphant – history of the NFL’s most important position","byline":"Melissa Jacobs","body":"<p>The Guardian caught up with Jason Reid to chat about <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Black-Quarterback-Means-America/dp/1368076629\">his new book</a>, which tell the story of the men who laid the foundation for today’s Black superstar quarterbacks and how modern players, such as Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, are navigating the unconscious bias and conscious racism that continue to permeate US society.</p> <p><strong>Fritz Pollard is a monumental figure in NFL history, as well as in your book. I know you spent time with grandson. Can you explain Pollard’s impact on the game?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jason Reid:</strong> Pollard was the first African American superstar in the NFL. He was listed as a running back though he played quarterback – not quarterback in the sense that we know it with the formations we know. But he was a quarterback too and he was the first Black head coach. It’s monumental on many levels. With regards to the quarterback position, someone had to be the first. He was an All-Pro in the first year of the league. He was a star in the first year of the league. And in a league that wasn’t welcoming at that point to Black men, he was an absolute outlier.</p> <p><strong>There was a disturbing period of 12years (1934-1946), when no Black players were in the NFL. Do you believe the owners had a formal agreement?</strong></p> <p>More than likely, it was a gentleman’s agreement that we’re just not going to have Blacks anymore. You talk about some Indiana Jones type of stuff if someone could find and authenticate a document that said we’re not going to have Black players in the league. But it probably doesn’t exist. There probably wasn’t a need to put it on paper.</p> <p><strong>Has the NFL done enough to acknowledge this period?</strong></p> <p>A lot of people argue no. I remember thinking to myself that it’s clearly a delicate situation for the league. On the one hand, a 12-year ban on Black players is not something the league would necessarily want to celebrate, but I think historical context is always important. But you understand why the league wouldn’t want to draw attention to that part of its history because it’s a very shameful part.</p> <p><strong>Which Black quarterback in NFL history doesn’t get enough credit?</strong></p> <p>This one is easy. Marlin Briscoe played at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, a small school. He was about 5ft 9in, 170lbs something. His nickname was The Magician. If Briscoe were playing today, think Kyler Murray.</p> <p>The Denver Broncos drafted him in 1968 but Black men were not being drafted to play quarterback in the 1960s. So, the plan was to move Marlin to be a cornerback. Well, he tells the Broncos, much to their surprise, “I’m not going to sign with you guys unless you give me a try at quarterback”. They did because they knew they would never give him the job. Briscoe performed well in his tryout, but it was rigged. But then the starter gets hurt and the backup is ineffective. You have a situation where the team is struggling so they throw Briscoe in there because they have no one else and he lights it up. He winds up throwing 14 touchdown passes, which is a Broncos rookie record that still stands even though John Elway was a Broncos rookie at one point.</p> <p>Then he goes home to work on his degree in Omaha and gets a tip that the Broncos are having quarterback meetings without him. They just took the job from him. So basically, they cut him late so he couldn’t land anywhere else in the NFL. He winds up going to Canada, like a lot of Black quarterbacks do, but Canada wasn’t for him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"106bb889da1eeab85e1d00e90d45b00d8dc005db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/106bb889da1eeab85e1d00e90d45b00d8dc005db/0_209_3580_2149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doug Williams was the first Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doug Williams was the first Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Stewart/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He comes back and reinvents himself, becomes a top wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills. Then he gets traded from the Bills to the Miami Dolphins where he’s on Don Shula’s undefeated team and wins two Super Bowls. He had a very good NFL career except he never played QB again.</p> <p>Briscoe retires and makes a very good living in the financial industry in LA. But he winds up getting hooked on drugs and ends up in jail. In jail one day, he watches [another Black quarterback] Doug Williams beat the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl. He feels that Doug’s success that date is in part due to him. Briscoe wound up off drugs, got his life together and worked at the Boys and Girls Club of Long Beach for years. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/27/sports/marlin-briscoe-dead.html\">He sadly passed away this past June</a>.</p> <p><strong>Fast-forwarding a bit into the modern era, talk about Mike Vick’s early career and the importance of playing in a diverse city like Atlanta</strong></p> <p>In Atlanta, you talk about a city with a huge African American culture and Vick played at a time when the whole hip-hop industry was blowing up and he’s a big part of that. Vick played unapologetically Black. His style of play was <em>I’m going to come out here and be me </em>and he was successful with it.</p> <p><strong>What modern quarterbacks do you think have followed suit – in other words, being unapologetically Black?</strong></p> <p>I think Lamar Jackson has. It’s interesting because Black people come from all kinds of backgrounds, socio-economic backgrounds, different upbringings. So it’s not like we all conform to a certain path. But when you talk about the approach in being who you are, Michael Vick did not try and be someone else. Lamar Jackson does not try and be someone else. They perform in a way that says accept me for who I am and if you don’t like it, so be it</p> <p><strong>Are there some quarterbacks who you think have felt like they’ve had to hide their blackness?</strong></p> <p>What I will say is there was a time when Black QBs would not speak out on social justice issues no matter what they thought. Colin Kaepernick obviously changed all that. Now we see Patrick Mahomes has spoken out on issues and Dak Prescott has too. Initially Dak took some heat from the Black community because they felt like he was toeing the company line, but he broke with [Dallas Cowboys owner] Jerry Jones about the protesting. I believe we are not at a point where Black men at that position feel they can be authentic in terms of putting their views out there if they choose.</p> <p><strong>You just mentioned Mahomes and in 2020 , in the wake of the George Floyd shooting, he famously took part in the powerful, player-led PSA that inspired<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\"> Roger Goodell to apologize to players</a> for the past and acknowledge that Black lives matter. If Mahomes wasn’t the “face of the league” at that point, would that PSA have had the same impact?</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2ctjBvEmRY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i2ctjBvEmRY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There’s no way it would have the same impact. What that did was force Roger Goodell to have a fork in the road. At that point Mahomes was the guy. He was the league MVP the previous year. When that video was made, he was coming off a Super Bowl championship. There was no question that he was at the top of the QB chart and QB is the most important position in the league. So with him being in that video saying what he said, it was inconceivable that the league would be on the opposite position of Patrick Mahomes. It just wouldn’t have worked. And Goodell understood the realities of the country dealing with the horrific videotaped murder of a Black man that illustrated what many had said about law enforcement and people in our community. It was so undeniably obvious that what happened to that man was wrong. For the league to come and say, no Black lives don’t matter is just not a position the league could have taken.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like there were enough prominent white allies in the period of Colin Kaepernick and the protests that followed?</strong></p> <p>There were some white players <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/news/2018/09/01/malcolm-jenkins-chris-long-philadelphia-eagles/\">like Chris Long</a>, who stood with Malcolm Jenkins and was authentic, and there were others who were allies of the players who were protesting. But there were also many players who disagreed with the protesting. And not all Black players agreed that taking a knee was the right position. That’s OK, everyone doesn’t have to agree. But the thing for me is that you now had superstar QBs taking a stand like they never had before. As I write in the book, it would have been shocking to see Joe Montana or John Elway say something, but Patrick Mahomes literally had skin in the game. It’s a different level when this is something that’s in your home.</p> <p><strong>Lamar Jackson, despite being the NFL’s MVP in 2019, is still not considered a true quarterback by some. Has the league shifted its definition of what a true quarterback is, and maybe it’s just that chunk of America that’s behind?</strong></p> <p>Mike Sando of The Athletic <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/3443022/2022/07/25/nfl-best-quarterbacks-tiers/\">does his QB tiers every year</a> and you’ve read about anonymous defensive coordinators saying that Jackson can’t pass: “If he has to pass, they can’t win.” Is he the greatest pocket passer in the history of the NFL? Of course not. But he’s also not a finished product. The reality is he’s already exceeded the expectations of the many people who said he couldn’t even play QB. Let’s give him an opportunity to evolve.</p> <p><strong>In closing, what was the most surprising aspect of your research for the book?</strong></p> <p>As with anyone who’s studied American history, I know that racism is sewn into the fabric of our country. But in my reporting, it was all the specifics and anecdotes. Like Warren Moon talking about how when he was a starter at the University of Washington, they were booing him before home games. It was Doug Williams telling me about the racist hate mail he got when he was a rookie in Tampa Bay. It was Marlin Briscoe telling me they just gave the job away when he was back in Omaha. I just didn’t have a full grasp of how bad the overt racism was.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rise of the Black Quarterback: What It Means For America <a href=\"https://books.disney.com/book/rise-of-the-black-quarterback/\">is available now.</a></p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/17/pregnancy-period-tracking-apps-privacy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"How private is your period-tracking app?

What to do? One suggestion made by this book is that we all connect our brains to neural interfaces which will collect everyone’s thoughts in a massive “super-brain cloud”, the better to sweetly reason ourselves collectively out of disaster. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>This isn’t yet feasible anyway, but it is an example of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/18/neuroscientist-hannah-critchlow-cambridge-consciousness-funny-word\" title=\"\">neuroscientist author</a>’s determined optimism. Her central argument is important and correct: that we have become too used to thinking of intelligence as the private skill of individuals, vying against one another in a neoliberal world of relentless competition. What is needed, especially in an age of irredentist warmongering and climate disaster, is a greater emphasis on our ability to reason together, our “collective intelligence”.</p> <p>This has been possible, of course, since we gruntingly taught one another how to make flint tools around the cave fire. What does neuroscience add to our understanding of it? Well, the brainwaves of people cooperating on a task can synchronise, which is interesting. And feelings of empathy help groups solve puzzles – as do higher female-to-male sex ratios. As in all good pop-science books, Critchlow describes many such experiments with clarity and infectious surprise. One Chinese psychologist found that creative problem-solving can be helped by going for a walk – but only if you don’t decide your route in advance. (This dampens down the activity of the decision-making prefrontal cortex.) On the other hand, there is also some of this sort of thing: “Scientists recently scanned grandmothers’ brains while they looked at photos of their grandchildren and saw areas of the brain associated with emotional empathy light up.” Um, no shit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Collective reasoning is often derailed by bias, emotional contagion, groupthink and other bugs in the human code</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book takes a more original and weirder turn as Critchlow speculates about technological interventions that could spur a greater level of communal thinking. Some seem sensible enough: improve ventilation, because higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations make us stupider; and cultivate a different use of media, because exposure to bad news makes us stupider too. But a lot of other suggestions seem rather dystopian. Critchlow speculates that we might be evolving culturally to become “a socially integrated mega-group, much like beehives and ant colonies”. This “might feel alien”, she allows, “but it could usher in a utopian era of human cooperation.” It might also feel alien because it’s how the Borg work in Star Trek, and they are not exactly utopian: they forcibly colonise and absorb every other life form they meet.</p> <p>She even implies that people who are not using their reasoning powers in order to further the good of the collective are, in this brave new world, to be chastised or even medically corrected, with neural implants or pharmaceuticals stimulating empathy circuits in the brains of psychopaths or narcissists. But the attempt to enforce collective thinking is a notable characteristic of totalitarian societies (the Borg is not a democracy). Critchlow does allow that collective reasoning is often dismayingly derailed by bias, emotional contagion, groupthink and other regrettable bugs in the human code, but doesn’t quite explain how such effects would be avoided rather than amplified in the glorious brain-cloud future.</p> <p>“The world could be altered by the power of our minds to tackle everything,” Critchlow enthuses at the end, though it remains unclear how groovy sci-fi brain interfaces might improve upon the joined-up thinking already enabled for millennia by the technology of writing, which has allowed humans to reason together across space and time and construct the edifice of modern science itself. Has it in the meantime also given rise to global consensus on questions of ethics and values? Obviously not.<br><br>Old-fashioned group thinking, on the other hand, has definitely also given us racism, the Bolsheviks and conspiracy theorists who think that Covid vaccines contained nanorobots to control our minds.

In the past 70 years, inflation has been as high as it is currently only three times: during the Korean war in the early 1950s, and after the two oil shocks of the mid- and late 1970s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/inflation-historic/giv-65627ner0D6h7eH5/\" data-alt=\"historical inflation\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/inflation-historic/giv-65627ner0D6h7eH5/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Not for 40 years – since the period immediately before the Falklands war – has inflation climbed above 10%, but there has been upward pressure on the cost of living since the global economy started to emerge from the pandemic-enforced lockdowns during 2021.</p> <p>Consistently over the past year, the figure has come in higher than forecast, but it will not merely be the leap in the headline number for the consumer prices index (CPI) – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-inflation-rise-petrol-diesel-prices\">up from 9.4% in June</a> – that will be a cause for concern.</p> <p>For a start, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said price increases were evident pretty much across the board. The ONS splits the CPI into 12 categories, and in nine of them inflation picked up last month. Food prices rose particularly strongly but there were also increases in clothing and footwear, restaurants and hotels, and recreation and culture.</p> <p>What’s more, there is clearly further bad news to come. The price of <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/producerpriceinflation/july2022\">goods leaving factory gates</a> – an indication of inflation in the pipeline – rose by more than 17% in the year to July, the highest rate in 45 years.</p> <p>There has been some better news. Oil prices are well below their peak and that is feeding in – albeit slowly – to the prices paid by motorists for petrol and diesel. The war in Ukraine has also prompted many countries to plant more crops to compensate for the lost supply, and while the ONS says the increased production has yet to be reflected in UK shop prices, it thinks it will have an effect over the coming months.</p> <p>Even so, the annual inflation rate has clearly not yet topped out, and if anything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-1-point-75-per-cent-in-biggest-hike-in-27-years\">the Bank of England’s forecast</a> of a peak of 13.2% in October may prove optimistic.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street digs beneath the headline CPI figure to look at measures of core inflation. Here, too, there was bad news. Inflation excluding food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, stood at 6.2% in July, up from 5.8% in June. The inflation rate for services, which provides a clue to price pressures generated domestically as opposed to global forces, was 5.7% in July, compared with 5.2% in June.</p> <p>The strength of headline and underlying inflation makes it more likely that the Bank’s monetary policy committee will follow its 0.5 percentage-point increase in interest rates this month with a similar-sized move when it meets again in September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/inflation-over-time/giv-6562EpiV856fcY3I/\" data-alt=\"Inflation graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/inflation-over-time/giv-6562EpiV856fcY3I/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the risks of a hard landing for the economy have increased because the ever-widening gap between prices and wages is leading to a sharp fall in consumer spending power.</p> <p>The ONS reported on Tuesday that regular real wages – excluding bonuses – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/uk-wages-in-june-fall-at-fastest-rate-for-20-years\">were falling at a record rate of 3%</a> – but that was based on a different measure of the cost of living to the one used by the government to assess whether its 2% inflation target is being hit.</p> <p>Using the government’s preferred measure, real earnings are falling by more than 5% – unprecedented in modern times.

There were no signposts towards this conclusion to a set that first promises to save modern men from redundancy, then swerves into an account of Adams’ saviour complex and inadequate self-care. But here we are at the 37-year-old’s teary catharsis, as a conversation she had at her sister’s funeral takes those disparate strands and tries to resolve them.</p> <p>So – odd question to have to ask – do those tears, and that emotional ambush, justify themselves in the context of the show? Men, I Can Save You starts as a mock-support group for straight males, struggling to adjust to their loss of power. Adams is in her comfort zone here, and her gags at the expense of men’s dying dominance are fun, if seldom insightful. But her heart’s not in it: she quite likes men, whereas a matriarchy – or her closest experience of one, an all-female WhatsApp group – fills her with dread.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/16/from-time-machines-to-threesomes-12-of-the-funniest-jokes-from-the-edinburgh-fringe\">From time machines to threesomes: 12 of the funniest jokes from the Edinburgh fringe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show then spirals off into an account, if not of Adams’ recent breakup, then of her journey since, learning to look after herself and prioritise her needs, sexual and otherwise. As if to prove men’s diminished power, she performs two routines that might be out of bounds for a male comic: one about hiring an escort, another boasting about having sex with an unnamed celebrity. (Adams revels in her newfound star status: see the not-infrequent nods to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/strictly-come-dancing-2022-the-contestants-ranked\">her forthcoming Strictly appearance</a>.)</p> <p>As the maleness theme resurfaces with a remarkable masturbatory dumbshow performed by Adams as Pierrot, the hour wants for something to resolve its contradictions. I’m not sure its tear-stained closing anecdote, for all that it reassures our host she will always be loved, quite does that. But its tender delivery papers over the cracks, and convinces you that Adams’ post-breakup journey, at least, has been redeemed.

They are better at killing pests, reducing plant damage and increasing crop yields, according to the first systematic review of ants’ contributions to crop production.</p> <p>Ants are generalist predators and hunt pests that damage fruits, seeds and leaves, leading to a drop in crop yields. A greater diversity of ants generally provides more protection against a wider range of pests, the study found.</p> <p>The analysis looked at 17 crops, including citrus, mango, apple and soya bean in countries including the US, Australia, the UK and Brazil. “In general, with proper management, ants can be useful pest controls and increase crop yield over time. Some ant species have similar or higher efficacy than pesticides, at lower costs,” researchers wrote in the <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.1316\">paper</a> published in Proceedings of Royal Society B.</p> <p>The Brazilian team looked at 26 species, most of them tree ants, which nest on plants or the ground but often climb plants. They found ants do best in diversified farming systems such as agroforestry (where trees and crops are grown on the same land) and shade-grown crops because there are more nesting sites and food resources for them.</p> <p>Lead researcher Dr Diego Anjos, from the Federal University of Uberlândia, said: “Our study encourages farmers to use more sustainable practices such as biological control provided by ants and practices of shaded crops as a way to naturally promote ants in crop systems.”</p> <p>The role of ants in agriculture is not yet completely clear because they can also be a problem. Pests such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/11/how-to-kill-winter-aphids-mealybugs\">mealybugs, aphids</a> and whiteflies, which produce a sugary water called honeydew, are generally more common when ants are around. This is because the ants feed on honeydew, and so essentially “farm” aphids like livestock, protecting them from predators in return.</p> <p>Researchers say nature-friendly management practices such as providing an alternative source of sugars (on the ground, near a tree’s trunk or on its branches) can interrupt this relationship. The ants are distracted and can continue to reduce the number of other pests such as caterpillars and beetles, which do not produce honeydew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"822d15db82b620b7d5870db6b4e54207890b324f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/822d15db82b620b7d5870db6b4e54207890b324f/0_0_1400_788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientists on the island of Fiji have discovered a type of ant that plants, fertilises and guards its own coffee crop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists on the island of Fiji have discovered a type of ant that plants, fertilises and guards its own coffee crop. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Renner/Ludwig Maximilians Universitat Munchen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The paper looked at most insect species that are considered pests around the world, covering 30 species across 52 studies. The data came from studies comparing groups of plants with ants set against plants where the ants were removed (mechanically or chemically), which strongly indicates the ants were responsible for the changes observed.</p> <p>There are more ants than any other insect, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43145363_Ants_and_sustainable_agriculture_A_review\">making up half</a> of the planet’s insect biomass. There are at least 14,000 known species of ant, with many more likely to remain unknown. Citrus growers in China have used ants in farming for centuries, and the insects have also been used to help control forest pests in Canada, cocoa pests in Ghana and crop pests in Nigeria.</p> <p>Ants found in the Pacific islands of Fiji can cultivate and grow at least six species of plant, as part of a mutually beneficial relationship that dates back 3 million years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/22/ants-behave-as-mini-farmers-in-fiji-study\">according to research</a> published in Nature.</p> <p>Dr Patrick Milligan, from the University of Nevada Pringle Lab, was not involved in the study but said the findings were “both heartening and not at all surprising”. He added: “They offer a neat and tidy description of ant-derived benefits that are ubiquitous across ecological and agricultural systems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/22/eu-legislation-restoration-ecosystems-biodiversity-aoe\">EU plan to halve use of pesticides in ‘milestone’ legislation to restore ecosystems </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is essentially another option in our farming toolset that can allow agriculture to move away from pesticides – which really damage neighbouring insect communities – but still improve crop yields.”</p> <p>Prof Adam Hart from the University of Gloucestershire, also not involved in the research, said it was confirmation of the important role ants have as pest controllers. “Many of us have been talking about ants as natural pest controllers. But, as with anything, it is usually more complex than we think once we start digging deeper.</p> <p>“The research suggests it may be profitable to move ant colonies into crop areas, and to do things to encourage the presence of ants. However, we need to be cautious – it isn’t all ants, or all crop systems, and they can have a cost. It’s all about developing a greater understanding of how ants interact with crop pests and other organisms.</p> <p>“A big take-home message for me is that we need to understand even more about fine-scale interactions if we are to farm better.

On one hand, he wants us to believe the actions were perfectly rational and justified in the context, while on the other he admits he could not tell his colleagues about the arrangements because he knew they would be shocked and unhappy.</p> \n<p>Morrison admitted on Wednesday he told nobody of the appointments after health – the plan was hatched between his office and his department, with signoff from the governor general. After initially suggesting it was an oversight not to have told ministers he had signed up to their portfolios, Morrison made clear on Wednesday that the information was in fact deliberately concealed from cabinet. Perhaps deep down a conscience lurks after all.</p> \n<p>Morrison also insists that everything was actually fine because he never used the powers he assigned himself, which shows just how responsible and clever he was after all. Silly us not to recognise it.</p> \n<p>“You mightn’t understand it because you haven’t been a prime minister in the middle of the worst crisis since the second world war,” Morrison told Sky News’s Andrew Clennell, revealing, once more, his belief that he is always the smartest person in the room.</p> \n<p>Never mind that Australia’s wartime prime ministers did not feel the need to give themselves the same portfolio delegations, nor any other prime minister in Australia’s history, who have all been prepared to stick with the primacy of the cabinet in the Westminster system, in which the prime minister was traditionally seen as “first among equals”.</p> \n<p>Morrison’s attempted explanation also reveals his portfolio stash was carefully curated – he only wanted those which had the “unilateral decision-making powers of ministers”. That is, only portfolios that gave the minister the final say.</p> \n<p>We know that in the one instance that Morrison did use his powers, it was to overrule a decision of resources minister Keith Pitt that he did not like because of its political implications in the lead-up to the election.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/defiant-scott-morrison-resists-pressure-to-resign-defends-secret-portfolios-as-necessary\">Defiant Scott Morrison resists pressure to resign, defends secret portfolios as ‘necessary’ </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We may never know if Morrison had similar intentions with other portfolios; if his “break glass in case of emergency” powers were genuinely related to the pandemic, or if Morrison had an eye on other political spot fires he wanted to control.</p> \n<p>No one is questioning that Morrison was prime minister in unusual times – times that, as he said, tested “every sinew and fabric of government”.</p> \n<p>But that did not require a rewrite of the system. It was the very time to ensure that the structure of Australia’s parliament remained respected and robust – and its elected members accountable. On that test, Morrison comprehensively failed.</p> \n<p>The member for Cook’s lack of contrition and lack of self-reflection on Wednesday was hardly surprising – they are the hallmarks of the man.

The non-Marvel multiverse potential is the evergreen hook of Idina Menzel’s Broadway vehicle If/Then, the NBC series Ordinary Joe, and Netflix’s new film Look Both Ways, in which Riverdale’s Lili Reinhart plays a recent college graduate whose unexpected pregnancy splinters her life into two distinct trajectories. Think a zillennial, streaming-era version of Sliding Doors, the 1998 film in which Gwyneth Paltrow plays a Londoner whose life diverges over making/missing a train and, like Look Both Ways, differentiates its timelines with a haircut.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/12/day-shift-review-jamie-foxx-netflix\">Day Shift review – Jamie Foxx staggers through fangs-for-nothing vampire flick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Look Both Ways, directed by Rafiki’s Wanuri Kahiu from a script by April Prosser, also plays out on dual timelines, but sands down the edges – its affect is warm and reassuring, its methods for affirming that everything’s gonna be all right are cozy and tame, especially in regards to young motherhood. Notably, the variable that precipitates the timeline split is not whether Reinhart’s Natalie Bennett decides to keep a surprise pregnancy by her friend turned one-night stand Gabe (Danny Ramirez) on the eve of graduation from the University of Texas in Austin. That choice, which cannot help but invoke the hellscape that is reproductive health in the US during the long dismantling of Roe v Wade, especially in Texas, stems out of one timeline and is quickly glossed over.</p> <p>Instead, the sliding door in this one-hour-and-50-minute film is whether or not Natalie gets pregnant (both Gabe and Natalie note that they used a condom, AKA did everything right, lest there be anything thorny here). In timeline A, the test is negative and Natalie goes on to Los Angeles with her best friend Cara (Aisha Dee) in pursuit of her dream to be a Hollywood animator. In timeline B, the tests are positive and a stunned Natalie immediately tells Gabe (he says all the right things, including “I’m pro your choice”). She summarily decides that it’s fate – “it just feels like something that I have to do, like this was supposed to happen” – and moves back in with her parents (played by Luke Wilson and Andrea Savage).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LOx5sD1okU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8LOx5sD1okU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There’s an imbalance between the two timelines, which cover five years and smoothly intersect: the LA timeline has the texture of reality, the motherhood plot the haze of fantasy. Childless in LA, Natalie wheedles her way into a job as an assistant to her hero, animation studio boss Lucy (Nia Long), begins dating a hot older co-worker, Jake (David Corenswet, who could be mistaken for Henry Cavill), and struggles to, as Lucy bluntly puts it, “find her voice” in animation. It’s a rose-colored portrait, for sure, but with distinctive familiarity with twentysomething ambition and aimlessness and enough observed details of the assistant class in LA – “roll calls”, post-work joints with friends, trawling Indeed.com – to work on its own.</p> <p>The motherhood timeline feel comparatively thin; Prosser’s script doesn’t give us much insight into who Natalie was before the pregnancy, other than she’s type A with a detailed five-year plan, or why she would have a baby at 22. It has the weightlessness of speculation, sanitized for a montage. Motherhood Natalie feels left out while scrolling through her childless peers’ lives on Instagram, struggles with her sense of self and making space for the drawing that was once her purpose. But the film resists anything too difficult or practical – there’s no real discussion of finances, and she and Gabe co-parent with will-they-or-won’t-they amicability. A potentially fruitful conflict with Cara – one that would make sense for two once-close friends on very different life tracks – fizzles out into a brief apology.</p> <p>Still, the film is an easy watch; Kahiu favors warm colors, easy listening and chapter breaks via animated title slides. Seeing two Reinharts seamlessly pass each other by in the same frame offers a mild dopamine hit. (It’s fun to speculate on multiple potential happy selves.) But the film’s ace is Reinhart, who has delivered enough batshit lines on Riverdale with complete commitment to make the script’s broad cliches (“finding my voice”) or clunky exposition (“you have that advertising job lined up, remember?”) work. With her wide, brimming eyes, Reinhart’s face has the physicality of an animated character – a strength underscored when Lucy has Natalie literally act out animated expressions in a job interview.

He signed for Blackburn in January and is determined to keep flying the flag for the South Asian community. Together with Zidane Iqbal of Manchester United and Hamza Choudhury, on loan at Watford from Leicester, the winger is among the 0.45% of professional players of South Asian heritage, according to data collected by the Professional Footballers’ Association. Arjan Raikhy and Kamran Kandola are in the academies at Aston Villa and Wolves respectively.</p> <p>Last year the PFA launched the Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme to nurture talent and inspire the next generation, with senior professionals mentoring players such as Markanday, who can in turn help youngsters. “There has been a lot more light on the South Asian community growing and players coming through and I think that has really helped,” Markanday says. “A few people have said that they look up to me and I try and help by giving advice to the younger kids.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think them seeing my journey is enough for them to see that it is possible and that they can go and do it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of those is Adam Khan, a goalkeeper at Blackburn who was introduced to Markanday at the club’s South Asian talent ID event in conjunction with the PFA that was attended by almost 70 youngsters this summer. “He came up to me and was like ‘you’ve really inspired me’, which was really nice to hear from someone who is now at the club. It was brilliant seeing all the young kids have a smile on their face and all the families. It is important for the parents to see that the club is doing this and that something could come from it. A lot of young kids are scared of the numbers that come through. You always hear ‘there is a less than 1% chance of making it’. I think that is a big factor, having that belief.”</p> <p>For Markanday, that belief stems from his family who attend most games. “My dad is the one who really pushed me. I turned up to trials at Tottenham and I’d be asleep in the car saying I didn’t want to go and he like dragged me inside. I’m really grateful. Sometimes I get messages from family in India who I haven’t even met and it is really nice to know they are looking out for me and that I have that wider network. I guess I’ve had a bumpy road which people may not see from the outside because they just see the social media and that I’m happy all the time, which is not always the case.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"20979938ccceec56b93799fd660ad5c92a606257\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20979938ccceec56b93799fd660ad5c92a606257/0_206_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eid prayers on the pitch at Ewood Park in May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eid prayers on the pitch at Ewood Park in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmed Khalifa/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday Khan, a first-year scholar who is of Pakistani heritage, and Riz Rehman, the PFA’s player inclusion executive, will meet an Under-11 and Under-12 player at Blackburn, both of whom are of South Asian descent, to remind them that there is a pathway. Markanday will no doubt crop up in conversation. “I think them seeing my journey is enough for them to see that it is possible and that they can go and do it,” he says. “Then when I speak to them, they really believe it. I can give them advice, tell them about my journey, the ups and the downs, and make sure that they understand what it takes to make it. It’s just about keeping going, keeping believing and I want to push on this season now.”</p> <p>The Championship leaders Blackburn, who visit Reading on Wednesday hoping to maintain their 100% start to the season, are a club in tune with their community. They recognise that more than 50% of children under 16 in Blackburn with Darwen are of South Asian heritage – and on Wednesday the English Football League will launch Together, a five-year equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategy overseen by the EFL’s head of EDI, David McArdle, who was appointed to the newly created role last November. The hope is that more follow their lead in ensuring the game is representative of the demographics it serves.

They will not have had any one player in mind when they came up with this approach, but they have inadvertently created the perfect circumstances for Jonny Bairstow to shine – and the results <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/03/jonny-bairstow-indispensable-to-england-after-so-long-as-spare-part\" title=\"\">have been explosive</a>.</p> <p>He is someone who rarely looks happy on the field if he is not happy off it, someone whose confidence can sometimes be fragile. There’s one moment that really stands out from my time working with him as an England coach. It came before the third Test against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2018, a series England won 3-0 while batting quite aggressively. Bairstow was not in the team for the first two games but was brought in for the final match, as was Stuart Broad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/16/england-aim-to-reignite-early-summer-spark-but-will-be-wary-of-south-africa\">England aim to reignite early summer fire but will be wary of South Africa | Ali Martin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was giving Jonny some throwdowns on the pitch when the captains came out for the toss, and Mike Atherton started his TV interview with Joe Root by saying something along the lines of England having their B team out. He was obviously referring to Broad and Bairstow both having names that start with a B, but Jonny heard it, paused, muttered something under his breath and seemed obviously unhappy. I think he took it as a suggestion that he was not a first choice, and he bristled at it. On that occasion he managed to turn that into extra motivation: he batted at three for the first time in his Test career, played brilliantly, scored a century and was named player of the match, but it illustrated how he can be affected by what is said about him.</p> <p>Over my last couple of years as batting coach I felt Bairstow became a little bit marginalised, and I think he felt similarly. Paul Farbrace would often talk about the need to make sure he felt valued and welcomed into the group, but that was hard to do when he was not always in the team. Jonny is a hugely generous guy when you get to know him, a very warm man who is loyal to his friends but who also makes new ones very quickly. But he also needs a lot of encouragement from those around him – and it is no coincidence that his performances this summer have come when that has been guaranteed.</p> <p>This England side is open, welcoming, and relaxed. The approach is a complete contrast to that under Alastair Cook, for example, when there was a lot of talk about discipline. That worked well for Cook and Jimmy Anderson, for example, but it did not suit every personality. Those players who require structure and routine might struggle in this setup, which is something the coaches will be aware of, but it is absolutely tailor-made for Bairstow. He is settled in the side and free to be himself, to dress as he wants, turn up when he wants, and train however suits him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4e11c8340d68b1f5ed41a5fbd54a222e811d8d9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e11c8340d68b1f5ed41a5fbd54a222e811d8d9e/428_591_3902_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonny Bairstow in the nets at Lord’s on Tuesday preparing for the first Test against South Africa which starts on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonny Bairstow in the nets at Lord’s on Tuesday preparing for the first Test against South Africa which starts on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a coach I found that many batters would prepare for each Test in exactly the same way, but Bairstow never had any routine at all. One day he wouldn’t hit a single ball, and the next he would spend an hour and a half with the bowling machine. I never had any idea what he would ask for, whereas I could set my watch by Cook. This new England side, where the players are encouraged to do exactly what suits them, completely fits with Bairstow’s approach to the game.</p> <p>Towards the end of Root’s spell as captain Bairstow was a bit in and out of the team. He did score a century in Sydney, but at that stage his Test career felt very much in the balance and in only slightly different circumstances it could well have finished. But he was also growing as a player and a person, soaking up experience and building confidence from very good performances for franchises. In Sydney and in the Caribbean we saw glimpses of that improvement, and this summer we have seen someone at the very peak of their powers.</p> <p>He now has that wealth of experience, the confidence of having played successfully under pressure and in a variety of conditions, and has built up a brutal range of powerful shots that he can unleash whether in white-ball or Test cricket. But Bairstow has also shown a level of technical excellence that has not always been obvious. His strokeplay has been breathtaking, and some of the weaknesses in his defensive game seem to have gone entirely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/16/brains-as-well-as-brawn-south-africas-fast-bowlers-are-more-than-just-brutes\">The Spin | Brains as well as brawn: South Africa fast bowlers are more than just brutes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/05/root-and-bairstow-ease-england-cricket-to-record-run-chase-against-india\" title=\"\">India at Edgbaston</a> he absorbed a fantastic spell from Jasprit Bumrah, perhaps the finest fast bowler in the world at the moment. For several overs Bumrah pounded away at off stump, knowing that the statistics suggest that eventually you will have some joy if you continue to do that. But Bairstow withstood it, played very straight, very late, looked well balanced, and just absorbed all that pressure. His attacking shots are fantastic, but his defence is also in a better place than I’ve ever seen it.</p> <p>Of course nobody knows how long this form can last. It must be said that it has coincided with a dry, hot summer and with a batch of Dukes balls which have not swung as prodigiously as they have in the past. Conditions have obviously helped the England team make good on their mantra of trying to put pressure on the bowlers, but with rain forecast and the first Test being played at Lord’s where the ball often moves that bit more, things might be a bit trickier. However everything I have seen of Jonny this summer, the place he seems to be in both as a human and as a batsman, and the team he now has around him, suggests to me that his great form will continue.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/17/colostomy-bag-boris-johnson-standups-comedy-life-threatening-disease-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"‘I dressed my colostomy bag as Boris Johnson’: the standups unleashing comedy on life-threatening disease","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/17/colostomy-bag-boris-johnson-standups-comedy-life-threatening-disease-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/17/colostomy-bag-boris-johnson-standups-comedy-life-threatening-disease-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"‘I dressed my colostomy bag as Boris Johnson’: the standups unleashing comedy on life-threatening disease","trailText":"From bowel cancer to Parkinson’s and dementia, the Edinburgh fringe is full of jokes about serious illness. What’s in it for the comedians – and their audiences?","byline":"Si Hawkins","body":"<p>Standup comedy must have been the furthest thing from Sarah Mills’ mind as she awaited some ominous test results in 2018. The diagnosis was life-altering: stage three bowel cancer, caught just in time, if also three years late. But then the comedy kicked back in. “Even the way I got told that I have cancer was funny,” says Mills. “They took me into a little side room and said [gravely]: ‘We’ve seen something angry-looking up your bum.’”</p> <p>Mills had almost stopped performing standup entirely by then but found that “the jokes start to write themselves. It’s a comedic gift.”</p> <p>Now in remission – “not high and dry, but getting there” – she is one of several comics to bring tales of serious illness to this year’s Edinburgh fringe. Her show Badass continues a surprisingly successful tradition. Comedians have an enviable capacity for finding silver linings in unlikely places.</p> <p>Before Badass, Mills presented the promising Chemo Chat Show online, talking to other comics, but then a new theatrical device entered her life. Mills’ colostomy bag has become a big social media hit, resplendent in TikTok dances and celebrity photo parodies. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/07/boris-johnson-resigns-as-conservative-leader-after-cabinet-revolt\">Tory ministers revolted in July</a>, she bought some blond wool and “dressed my bag as Boris”. The jokes, as she says, write themselves.</p> <p>Demystifying stoma bags and bowel cancer is one of Mills’ main goals. The recent death of campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/28/podcaster-deborah-james-dies-of-bowel-cancer-bowelbabe\">Deborah James</a> jolted awareness, but usually “people just don’t want to talk about it,” she says. The major culprit? “Poo. It feels like the very worst taboo.”</p> <p>Her Edinburgh show raises further issues: NHS underfunding, benefit unfairness and her disastrously belated diagnosis. Mills had a check-up three years earlier, in her late 20s, due to blood in her stool, but “they thought I was too young, and didn’t test me for it,” she says. </p> <p>Not everyone could make colostomy and cancer entertaining. “It’s really galvanised me as a comedian,” she says. “I’ve got a lot more to say.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca73a06030971c980becfa7cb81d8f36f6761d77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca73a06030971c980becfa7cb81d8f36f6761d77/240_0_7200_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terence Hartnett, whose 1 Ball Show is about testicular cancer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terence Hartnett, whose 1 Ball Show is about testicular cancer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: (PR)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Terence Hartnett is also in that curious position, crediting serious illness – and successful treatment – with inspiring his fringe debut. The symptoms? “A testicle bigger than a tennis ball!” the New Yorker announces. “I had a rare, aggressive form of testicular cancer. My doctor said: ‘I told my wife about your case, it’s so interesting.’ And I thought: ‘That’s not a good sign.’”</p> <p>Previously best known for a podcast, Down by the River, in which he roamed the US by van, Hartnett was also lacking focus for his comedy, pre-diagnosis. How soon did he think of this as material? “I was taking notes in that first doctor’s appointment,” he says, “and before my first surgery, while getting my sperm frozen.”</p> <p>Those notes became 1 Ball Show, his debut hour at the fringe. The jokes flowed easily. “It’s difficult to name a funnier cancer than testicular – it’s just an inherently funny place in your body.”</p> <p>Beneficial for comedians they may be, but the appeal of these shows for audiences is intriguing, particularly to those of us who have lost loved ones to serious illness. Would Mills have watched a cancer show before doing one? “Possibly not, if I’m totally honest,” she says, but then the fringe should encourage experimentation. “Exactly. Who else is telling jokes about colonoscopies?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eeff27d7102b69b7fb4a919f2cd8b1a3e5dc60d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eeff27d7102b69b7fb4a919f2cd8b1a3e5dc60d/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Sinha.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Sinha uses his Parkinson’s disease as material.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strong malady material can boost your career, as the veteran standups Paul Sinha and Steve Day discovered. “I’ve just finished touring my big Parkinson’s show,” says Sinha, of Hazy Little Thing Called Love. “It’s very much my magnum opus.”</p> <p>You would forgive him for avoiding the subject. Fresh from TV success on The Chase and Taskmaster in 2019, Sinha was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and cancelled that year’s fringe show to take stock. The former GP is now embarking on his first full fringe since then, with One Sinha Lifetime, “the difficult second post-diagnosis” show. Rather than worry about performing, he feels that his uncertain future allowed new freedom. “I don’t know when I’m going to start stammering or stumbling through my speech,” he says. “What I’ve decided is to be a little bit more forthright in my comedy. Take fewer prisoners.”</p> <p>It is working: this year Sinha plays his biggest fringe room yet. “I look at Parkinson’s as just another selling point, I suppose,” he says. “Not the disease, as such – more what it tells you about your life.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"73bcc2ad683bc3650432a55d39a2c9c4ca902327\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73bcc2ad683bc3650432a55d39a2c9c4ca902327/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Day.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Day’s show is about his father’s dementia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Wadham/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steve Day found condition-based comedy tougher, initially. After several shows themed around his deafness, he hit a nerve in 2018 with a heartfelt hour about his father’s illness. Adventures in Dementia gets a reboot this year, after his father’s death. “I was going to call it Flogging a Dead Dad,” he says, but he settled for Further Adventures in Dementia.</p> <p>“When I first started doing it I thought: ‘There’s nothing funny here’, but you find the jokes,” says Day, who can’t help himself. “My dad was really, really ill when I first did the show. I’d think: ‘Stay alive another week – I’ve got press in.’ But it was tough, like being beaten up every day. So I’m doing it again because I hadn’t done it from a place of stability.”</p> <p>These shows can feel like a sort of sweary support group, but with trickier chats after, due to the fringe’s notoriously short turnaround times. During Day’s first run, people with similar dementia stories would linger as he frantically disconnected his equipment. He couldn’t hear them. “My hearing aids filled with sweat,” he recalls. “I was flattered, it means the show came across, massive compliment, but would you please fuck off?”</p> <p>Month-long fringe runs are draining at the best of times, so these post-traumatic shows shouldn’t be rushed into, as Beth Vyse would attest. Currently on sabbatical from live stages, she now lectures at Liverpool’s Institute of Performing Arts, and appears in Coronation Street (“My gran didn’t care when I was in the RSC. She said: ‘When you’re in Corrie, you know you’ve made it.’”)</p> <p>Vyse was diagnosed with breast cancer more than a decade ago, but continued performing outrageously surreal comedy, “even the night I found out”. Only after the five-year all-clear did she create a show, As Funny As Cancer, which she performed in Edinburgh in 2016. “It took me that long to deal with,” she says. “If there are still tears or emotions, I don’t think you can tell the story.”</p> <p>It started badly. Her first preview was read from a script, on a stool – “the audience were in floods, so sad!” – and needed a radical rethink. “‘How could it be crazier, more my style?’ So first I had this massive boob, and came bouncing in, like a space hopper,” she says.</p> <p>Her dark material went in splendidly weird directions – Dolly Parton and Michael Jackson impressions, mass audience inseminations – and had wide acclaim. “The tour was huge,” she recalls. “Then I said: ‘Enough is enough,’ and stopped.” With such emotive material, timing is everything. “Do it when you’re ready,” Vyse concludes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ce2fee3324094f824c3d70b4956507f954c2b44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ce2fee3324094f824c3d70b4956507f954c2b44/0_213_2326_2907/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alistair Barrie\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair Barrie created a show about breast cancer, after his wife’s diagnosis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Crossick/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then again, the stage is often how standups process heavy concepts. This year Alistair Barrie is doing an angry political show, Alistaircratic, beset by news-related rewrites. But it’s a breeze compared with 2015’s No More Stage Three, about how his wife, Emily, was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer until just before that fringe.</p> <p>Far from taking offence at the onstage indiscretions, she worked on his PowerPoint presentation, did promo in Edinburgh, a month in Australia, Singapore, and beyond. “Her attitude was: ‘I’ve got cancer; I might as well make the most out of it,’” says Barrie. Flyering at the fringe was an experience, though. “Someone turned to her and said: ‘That is not a fit subject for comedy! My mother-in-law died of cancer!’ and stormed off. And Emily’s standing there, with no hair, going: ‘Fucking hell.’”</p> <p>Emily recovered, and Barrie now stages an annual Hertfordshire Breast Unit benefit, so those gags aren’t retired entirely. There is a pattern for who gets them, he says: “The people who’ve had cancer, I always found, have the best sense of humour about it.”</p> <p>The fringe newcomers have further plans, too. Hartnett wants to visit colleges: “I’m going to say: ‘You just saved your life by touching yourself!’ What a gospel to spread.” Mills, meanwhile, has a Badass sitcom optioned, and may do a live sequel: the full stoma story. “There’s obviously another show, like: ‘I pooed in a bag and it went viral,’” says the comic. “Isn’t it surprising where life takes you?”</p> <p>The bag stays out of sight on stage, though. Audiences aren’t ready for that, and Mills is no exhibitionist. Controlled, home-filmed videos are very different from the vagaries of live performance, and her current show has a wider message about body positivity and hidden disabilities. “I talk about my body, and how it changed,” she says, “how I still love my body.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c34a01babfdc5d48ed0384ad20225a82f88c613\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c34a01babfdc5d48ed0384ad20225a82f88c613/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Vyse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Vyse waited until she had the all-clear from cancer to make work about it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is an interesting irony of these shows, how facing serious illness can strengthen the onstage voice. Mills is “a lot more passionate” now, and clearly on a mission, using her wit to raise awareness – toilet humour saving lives, you might say. She does sound understandably apprehensive about “reliving the day that I got told I had cancer, with a bunch of strangers” for a month. But then that diagnosis story gets the ultimate awkward laugh, the sort of moment that is impossible to manufacture.</p> <p>The old adage about laughter being the best medicine?

Shakhtar Donetsk lost four consecutive cup finals between 2016 and 2019. So did AEK Athens between 2017 and 2020. Celtic didn’t win any of their League Cup finals between 1971 and 1974.

After the fall of the Ceaușescu regime in December 1989, the Romanian first division became less predictable.”</p> <p>Next, a hard-luck story from Thailand. “After winning the Thai Premier League in 2007,” begins Dale Farrington, “my club, Chonburi, went on the following run of finishes: 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, 2nd. We were also FA Cup runners-up in 2014. That will take some beating.”</p> <p>It will, but Opeyemi Ajala has managed it. “In Nigeria, Mighty Jets lost six consecutive Nigerian FA Cup finals between 1962 and 1967, and three more between 1970 and 1974,” writes Opeyemi. “Egypt’s Zamalek Sporting Club finished as runners-up on seven successive occasions between 1950-51 and 1958-59.”</p> <p>Finally, Vincent Lacey has provided a very handy list of other notable bridesmaids.

Impressive in a way that, despite not spending anything on transfer fees, we still mismanaged our finances to the extent of having a winding-up petition served on the club in 2017.”</p> <p>And finally to a team who, in our nostalgic hearts, will always be bloodying the noses of the elite. “We’ve only just slipped into the fifth tier, so hopefully you will not add further insult to injury by ignoring the claims of Oldham Athletic?” writes Adam Connor. “Both our record signing, Ian Olney (£0.75m from Aston Villa, June 1992), and record sale, Earl ‘The Pearl’ Barrett (£1.7m to Aston Villa, Feb 1992), occurred more than 30 years ago, in that apparent year of the splurge.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7199887abf421200db7c4b6c55619e55723015fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7199887abf421200db7c4b6c55619e55723015fb/136_10_1840_1104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oldham’s Earl Barrett (centre) celebrates his goal in the epic FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United in 1990\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oldham’s Earl Barrett (centre) celebrates his goal in the epic FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Knowledge archive</h2> <p><strong>“Which player has played the most games under the management of his dad?”</strong> asked Steven Wild in 2011. <strong>“I would guess Nigel Clough is a frontrunner with 311 league games, far outplaying the likes of Darren Ferguson with 27 under Sir Alex.”</strong></p> <p>Step forward Lee Johnson. “He played 192 League matches for Yeovil (all under his dad) and 155 times for Bristol City (136 times under his dad),” writes Robin Tucker. “So that makes a grand total of 328 League games under his dad.

So why does finding love feel harder than ever?","trailText":"I scroll on apps during TV ad breaks, while I’m waiting for the microwave, in bed – but my hopes have given way to frustration, says author Annie Lord","byline":"Annie Lord","body":"<p>One of the first things I did when a long relationship ended in 2019 was download a dating app – mainly motivated, I must admit, by fantasies about my ex’s reaction to seeing my profile. Since then, I’ve never really stopped. I sit on them during TV ad breaks, while I’m waiting for the microwave to ping, in all those pockets of time where I used to listen to my own thoughts. In bed I lie on my back scrolling until my hand tingles because all the blood has run from it. Yet, despite my commitment, they’ve not found me a boyfriend, or even much sex. In fact, they’ve done the complete opposite to what I thought they would do when I first heard about them. They don’t make anything easy – they make it much harder.</p> <p>I was at university when the people around me first started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/aug/12/tinder-10-years-dating-apps-podcast\">using Tinder</a>. I had a boyfriend back then, so I never signed up. But I remember being jealous of the people who did. It would make it so much easier to find someone, I assumed: you wouldn’t have to waste nights out chatting to people in the smoking area only to find out they have a girlfriend, or open the door to rejection by writing your name on a napkin and giving it to a waiter. You just had to decide whether you like the look of someone, wait for them to do the same and if so, you can both meet up and have sex, or date, whatever you wanted. Apps would make the ambiguity of attraction explicit, obvious. </p> <p>Admittedly, my initial experience with apps was fun. Walking out of the tube station towards my date, I’d take out my headphones and think about how exciting it was that I got to spend the whole evening getting to know this stranger. The apps allowed me to interact with people outside my comfortable circle of journalist friends. There was the delivery man I met at a pub five minutes from mine who liked heavy metal because he heard that if you listened to it at the gym, it brought your heart rate up; who pointed out the corner shop where he could never buy booze because the owner knew his mum. There were disappointments too, like the guy who spent 12 minutes trying to find this video of himself on ketamine because it was “really funny” (it wasn’t). But even when things didn’t go to plan, they were still in motion, there were opportunities, there were people saying: “Are you about on Thursday?”</p> <p>Over time these dates became sparser. Instead of asking you out, they’d ask for your Instagram handle and then occasionally send you flame emojis in reaction to selfies. If you did end up meeting they’d often disappear after the third date, or you would. It started to feel like everything was falling through your hands. Finding a date felt tiring, impossible even. Apps place a lot of hidden obstacles in the way of you actually finding someone, and after a while, people stopped trying to manoeuvre around them.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that apps give you so many options that no one ever seems like the right one. You might have had loads of fun with that lawyer with the sexy throaty laugh, but then the girl with a meme about landlords on her profile might seem as if she’d be more your type. So you stop replying, often without an explanation, and it’s easier to do that when you’ve met over an app because they don’t know any of your friends, don’t work in the same building as you, don’t cross over into your world. You can ghost them without any repercussions for your actions. No judgment.</p> <p>Even the fun of meeting a diverse range of people quickly fades, because after a while the algorithm seems to identify your type and starts showing you endless carbon copies of the same person. (For me that usually means some guy in a fleece with a little hoop earring who makes documentaries.) </p> <p>In retrospect it seems quite naive of me to think that apps would result in connections. Hinge’s tagline is “<a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/creative-works/project/hinge-designed-be-deleted\">Designed to be deleted</a>”, but if that were true, it wouldn’t have much of a business model – that’s why each day you’re tempted with a notification showing your “most compatible” on the app.<strong> </strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/swipe-right--the-decade-that-changed-dating\">Ten years into the reign of Tinder</a>, will we start leaving? There have been signs – recent articles about the decline of apps, pieces offering advice on meeting people offline. But turning back time may not be so easy. Apps allowed us to portion off our romantic lives away from general socialising, so now when you’re out, you don’t really think about meeting anyone – that’s become something you do while you’re waiting for the shower water to heat up. Sometimes I’ll be around actual hot men at a party and I don’t even register them until the next day, when my anxious brain is running over the night to obsess over every mistake I made. </p> <p>Obviously love still happens, despite it all. People reply even when they’re tired from work, they turn up at 6.30pm on a Tuesday even if it means they’ll get a four-quid fine for missing their spin class. “You have to break the cycle!” commanded my friend who did meet her boyfriend on an app. “Push through the nonchalance!”</p> <p>A few days later I got my opportunity to try. I matched with a man who’d I’d matched with on three separate occasions across different apps. “Not you again,” he messaged. To which I replied, “Here we go again”. There was something weirdly romantic about it – like we were these star-crossed lovers, brought together by several different algorithmic organising methods, all the stats and patterns pointing us towards each other then pulling us away. If only we could fight through our lethargy, through another “so how was your weekend?” conversation, perhaps we might find something real. Maybe we’ll stick around to learn each other’s favourite sort of sandwich, the birthmark on the top of their shoulder. So I told him I was free that week, even though I was meant to get a train to my parents’ house. I took him into account when working out my hair-washing schedule.</p> <p>Needless to say, we never met up.</p> <ul> <li><p>Annie Lord is a writer based in London and the author of Notes on Heartbreak</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/17/nsw-flood-inquiry-opts-not-to-recommend-raising-of-warragamba-dam-wall","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T06:51:36Z","webTitle":"NSW flood inquiry opts not to recommend raising of Warragamba dam wall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/nsw-flood-inquiry-opts-not-to-recommend-raising-of-warragamba-dam-wall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/nsw-flood-inquiry-opts-not-to-recommend-raising-of-warragamba-dam-wall","fields":{"headline":"NSW flood inquiry opts not to recommend raising of Warragamba dam wall","trailText":"Premier says he will push ahead and seek funding to raise wall 14 metres despite concerns for endangered flora and fauna","byline":"Peter Hannam","body":"<p>The New South Wales flood inquiry has stopped short of recommending raising the Warragamba Dam wall, listing the $2bn-plus project as just one option governments have to reduce flood risks in Sydney’s Hawkesbury-Nepean valley.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nsw.gov.au/nsw-government/projects-and-initiatives/floodinquiry\">The inquiry’s report</a>, released on Wednesday by the state government, identified pros and cons of raising the wall of Sydney’s main source of drinking water by 14 metres.

The government wants to control all information. They don’t want you to talk with people that they don’t control.”</p> <p>It wasn’t just government employees impeding my access, however. After I left the camp manager’s office, a representative from the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, joined me at one of the health centres. During my interview with the clinical lead, he emphasised how Rwanda and camp management were doing a good job in terms of public health, and contradicted and downplayed what other health experts had told me about NCDs affecting refugees at younger ages.</p> <p>Faith Kasina, a spokesperson for the UNHCR, said the representative’s comments related to a lack of data and research on NCDs among refugees and the host community in Rwanda.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There’s a sinister undercurrent: if you talk against the Rwandan government, your situation changes immediately</p> <footer> <cite>Lucy Hovil, refugee Law Initiative </cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I arrived at the camp the next morning, thinking I was going to shadow community health workers doing their job and speak to people receiving treatment for NCDs as agreed with the clinical lead the day before, I read an email from the UNHCR representative. He wrote that he had sought permission from the camp manage for me to speak to refugees. The answer was no.</p> <p>Later, in an interview, the camp manager veered between denying NCDs were an issue and boasting that “Mahama camp is the best camp in Rwanda, with 100% of facilities”.</p> <p>The UNHCR representative, meanwhile, asked the purpose of my line of questioning, and stepped in to reword some of the camp manager’s answers.</p> <p>The UNHCR is an influential international organisation that gets its <a href=\"https://reporting.unhcr.org/contributions-pledged-2022\">funding from states</a> including the UK. Jeff Crisp, a research associate at the University of Oxford’s Refugee Studies Centre and former head of policy development and evaluation at the UNHCR, explained that in places where the government is a “relatively authoritarian one, UNHCR tends not to push the boundaries too much and accepts limitations imposed on it by authorities”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f6274737620f9ccbc298b2a2a93f429bfbe2e01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f6274737620f9ccbc298b2a2a93f429bfbe2e01/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahama refugee camp in Rwanda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camp manager boasted that it was “the best in Rwanda”.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Nkinzingabo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of journalistic inquiries, there are “no hard and fast written rules”. He added: “In some countries, UNHCR might be relatively amenable to facilitate trips to see people and places. In others, it might be much more reluctant and, as is probably the case in Rwanda, actively block access to journalists.”</p> <p>Kasina said: “UNHCR always facilitates media trips, as we believe the work of journalists plays a critical role in highlighting issues affecting refugees and helping raise awareness.” However, camps in Rwanda are managed by the Rwandan authorities, and interviews with refugees have to be authorised by the camp manager, who works with the ministry in charge of emergency management, she explained.</p> <p>The UNHCR has released <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/press/2022/4/62585e814/un-refugee-agency-opposes-uk-plan-export-asylum.html\">a public statement criticising the UK’s deal with Rwanda</a>, expressing “strong opposition and concerns”. It has also “gone out of its way to praise Rwanda”, says Crisp, allowing refugees to be evacuated from Libya, and being positive about Rwandan refugee policy in general.</p> <p>I was left feeling angry and uneasy, and wondering what lay behind this image of Rwanda that the authorities, and the UN to some extent, was trying to project.</p> <p>My experience of being micromanaged and blocked from doing my job is largely irrelevant. What it shows, however, is a glimpse of something more sinister, according to Lucy Hovil, senior research associate at the Refugee Law Initiative, University of London.</p> <p>“Just demonising Rwanda as a country isn’t helpful in this whole discussion, and yet there are people who have been kept in camps for years and years, and that’s a terrible situation,” she said.</p> <p>“Compared to what the UK is doing, Rwanda has got fairly progressive refugee policies in that it has generally opened its borders to refugees. If you look at the number of people it’s hosting right now, it’s relatively significant.</p> <p>“But there’s a sinister undercurrent to all of that: if you do in any way talk out against the government, your situation changes immediately.”</p> <p>In 2018, when refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/12/uks-rights-assessment-rwanda-not-based-facts\">staged a protest over not having enough to eat</a>, Rwandan authorities fired on them, killing 12 and arresting more than 60 others. Other <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/07/07/cost-speaking-rwanda\">people’s lives have been destroyed</a> for speaking out about injustice in Rwanda.</p> <p>Umuhoza, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison on charges of spreading genocidal ideology and false information, says members of her party have been disappeared, imprisoned and assassinated. “We have no room to express ourselves. I do it but the majority of Rwandans cannot. They are afraid to express their mind [in case they are] accused of genocidal ideology or being an enemy of the state.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00da7e91ebb6187a3ac545d3802b345d530e387f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00da7e91ebb6187a3ac545d3802b345d530e387f/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mahama refugee camp in Rwanda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Johnson was told she could face arrest for entering a medical appointment at the camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Nkinzingabo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, as freedom of speech remains elusive, the Rwandan government’s PR campaign has ramped up in light of the increased attention following the announcement of the UK-Rwanda deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/25/diabetes-and-high-blood-pressure-why-are-urban-diseases-affecting-refugees-acc\">Diabetes and high blood pressure: why are ‘urban’ diseases affecting refugees?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I asked the Home Office how the British government could ensure free and fair reporting of a flagship policy when a UK journalist was denied basic access to refugees in Rwanda, they were “unable” to comment.</p> <p>Instead my request was sent to Harry Burns, a political strategist, who ran the British Labour party’s election campaign in 2017, and who is now the managing director of the PR firm Chelgate Consulting.

In the meantime, the question for the average person is: where do we go to get on it now?</p> <p>It’s fair to say that most nightclubs in the UK are not cool, vibrant spaces where good DJs play and culture gets pushed forward. The loss of inner-city clubs such as Manchester’s <a href=\"https://mixmag.net/read/manchester-south-nightclub-closes-clint-boon-news/\">South</a> and London’s <a href=\"https://ra.co/news/77552\">Printworks</a> to ravenous redevelopment is a misery of its own, but there is also the other side of the industry to consider. That is: the clubs you go to when your one and only goal is to get wasted, dance in a circle around your bags and maybe snog someone to the dulcet tones of Ava Max. Clubs such as <a href=\"https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/south-devon-nightclub-closes-permanently-6619248\">Coast Bar &amp; Nightclub</a> in Kingsbridge, <a href=\"https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/rawtenstall-nightclub-closes-down-owner-22168084\">Revival</a> in Rawtenstall<strong>, </strong>and <a href=\"https://teddington.nub.news/news/local-news/the-party-is-over-in-battersea-with-news-that-bunga-bunga-has-closed-its-doors-forever-144330\">Bunga Bunga</a> in Battersea – named, of course, after Silvio Berlusconi’s infamous sex parties and offering a mix of karaoke, three dancefloors, and metre-long pizzas. All of them slain by the same economic forces, all of them shutting up shop with the same heartfelt sentiment: “So long and thanks for all the memories.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a0aab7d6a77501e55f8df38c054f1f366d521a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a0aab7d6a77501e55f8df38c054f1f366d521a2/0_0_5589_3354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘The kind of “drunk” you get in these clubs is unlike the kind of “drunk” you get anywhere else on Earth.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The kind of “drunk” you get in these clubs is unlike the kind of “drunk” you get anywhere else on Earth.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everynight Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These places are the bread and butter of British nightlife. While high street mega-club chains such as Oceana and Liquid have had their day, replaced primarily by roaming party machines like Propaganda, smaller clubs have stayed reliable purveyors of good old-fashioned fun. Offering an experience somewhere between a pub lock-in on Christmas Eve and a foam party in Costa Brava, they’re as ramshackle as they are routine. No frills, no C-list celebrity appearances, no renting a big jacket and entering a room full of dry ice just to drink flavoured vodka shots out of a freezer: just a room the size of a small flat, a load of purple strip lights and a DJ who knows where the crossfade setting is on Spotify.</p> <p>The kind of “drunk” you get in these clubs is unlike the kind of “drunk” you get anywhere else on Earth. Typically, confirmation of where you’re going will be met with a chorus of: “<em>Oh God</em>” and the compulsion to steel yourself as if you’ve just been drafted. A combination of exhilaration and panic propel you into the night as you crumple jelly-legged into a morass of shot sticks, fishbowls and “signature” cocktails made from Haribo and premixed tequila evil. Only in this specific environment will you order “three VKs and a pint glass please” and then projectile vomit rainbow sludge into a sink. Only in this specific environment does Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO feel like one of the most sublime compositions in music history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/22/printworks-london-club-scene\">The Guide #44: Club closures leave the scene looking bleak – is there hope on the horizon?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Strangely, these clubs aren’t as impersonal as their cookie cutter approach might suggest.

Perhaps it’s their size and the fact that every time you go you’re likely to see the same 50 faces from the week before, but there is a comforting familiarity that at least gives the illusion of community. It’s hard not to feel a sense of intimacy when you’re crammed arse to arse in a box room – screaming, uninhibited, as vulnerable as an upside down newborn. It’s a great feeling, a slice of everyday euphoria that flies so close to the sun it can’t help but end with someone crying, fighting or falling over.</p> <p>These clubs might not be written about in decades to come, but as far as cheap thrills go there is nothing better. And when the lights come on, we’re all spat out on to the same road. Indistinct shouting, taxis honking.

But the case for the present is strong. “It’s as if something immense or catastrophic is always on the cusp of happening …” writes the Zambian-American novelist Namwali Serpell. “We are all heroes of cataclysm now.”</p> <p>If there’s an emerging theme to the art of these crisis-racked times, it’s time itself: multiverses, parallel lives and wormholes; groundhog days and grandfather paradoxes; time-travellers and their ever-patient wives. From indie films (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/11/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review-nothing-nowhere-over-a-long-period-of-time\" title=\"\">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/08/palm-springs-review-the-time-loop-film-is-back-again-groundhog-day\" title=\"\">Palm Springs</a>), to prestige TV (Russian Doll, Dark), to queer romance novels (see Casey McQuiston’s delightful One Last Stop), creators seem intent on mucking with the space-time continuum. Could there be a better metaphor for our perpetual present than an inescapable cosmic loop? The more inevitable the future seems, the more we dream of one that can be averted – of a past that can be undone.</p> <p>In Serpell’s new novel The Furrows, time mimics grief – it slurs, skips, loops and folds in on itself. When Cee Williams is 12, her seven-year-old brother, Wayne, dies in her care. She is holding him when he takes his last breath. Something electric passes between the siblings in this dying moment – “his body swept clean of him, mine filled to bursting”. The exchange is so intense that Cee passes out. When she wakes, Wayne’s body is gone. Serpell’s premise is a magnificent snare; you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better opening chapter this year.</p> <p>Without flesh-and-blood proof, Cee’s mother, Charlotte, refuses to believe (or perhaps to admit) that her son is dead. The media loves an anguished mother, if she is the right sort of mother, and Charlotte is: photogenically bereft, middle-class, white (Wayne and Cee’s father is Black). As Charlotte builds herself a charity empire, Cee is dragged from therapist to therapist. “I’ve been trained my whole life,” she explains, “to tell stories to strangers.”</p> <p>But Cee’s account of her brother’s accident is slippery. In one version, Wayne drowns in a riptide at a lonely beach; in others, his little body is tossed from a fairground carousel, or hit by a car. Perhaps none of these stories is true, or perhaps they’re all true in some wrenchingly elemental way. “I don’t want to tell you what happened,” Cee pleads, “I want to tell you how it felt.” Is Wayne dying in universe after universe, or just in a cruel loop in Cee’s mind? Does it matter?</p> <p>Serpell’s prize-winning first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/14/the-old-drift-namwali-serpell-review\" title=\"\">The Old Drift</a>, was a rowdy epic – one of those gloriously overstuffed, state-of-the-nation debuts that can be forgiven its narrative sins because it’s so abundantly smart. Tracing the fate of four generations of Zambian women, from colonial settlement through to a drone-surveillance future – via the political surreality of Zambia’s 1960s space programme – The Old Drift was a collision of magical realism, Afrofuturism and postcolonial picaresque.</p> <p>There are no talking mosquitoes in Serpell’s new book, no high-Dickensian oddballs – The Furrows is far more intimate, a novel of skin pressed to skin. Where The Old Drift sparked comparisons to Salman Rushdie and Zadie Smith, The Furrows feels more akin to Hari Kunzru’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/28/white-tears-hari-kunzru-review\" title=\"\">White Tears</a>, or Omar El Akkad’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/01/what-strange-paradise-by-omar-el-akkad-review-desperate-journeys\" title=\"\">What Strange Paradise</a>: a modern parable, or sociopolitical trauma made flesh. Told once, the story of Wayne’s accident is a tragedy; but told again and again and again it becomes a kind of elegy, a lament for broken Black bodies, and recurrent horrors. “For us, death is everywhere,” Cee’s father warns her. “Of course,” she replies, “but in the end what does knowing that give you?”</p> <p>In the second half of The Furrows (which is less riveting than the first, but tantalisingly cryptic), Wayne’s absence becomes a kind of shapeshifting presence. Decades after losing her brother, Cee will meet a man who shares his name: a seeming doppelganger, who himself feels haunted by some trailing shadow. Cee’s attraction to him is as ferocious as it is taboo – “it feels like some deep, atavistic deja vu” – and it forces her to confront the lie she is being groomed to uphold, as she prepares to take on a larger role in her mother’s charity. “We’ve climbed up a couple of rungs on the class ladder, Charlotte and I, propped on Wayne’s ghostly back,” Cee admits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>How lucrative white guilt and trauma can be, The Furrows shows. And how easily it can slide into something darker</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Furrows shows how lucrative white guilt and trauma can be. And how easily it can slide into something darker. Charlotte moves through the world like a bruised queen. “She looks regal and wounded,” Serpell writes, “grand and tender. But she wears a crown of entitlement.”</p> <p>Serpell is a terrific destabiliser, even at the level of the sentence. A room echoes with the “curbed bedlam” of sitcom laughter; commuters ignore each other in the “slotted indifference” of a train carriage. There are no tidy moral lessons at the end of her dissonant and time-contorting fable – no bones to bury, no truth to pin, no mysteries solved – only the inescapable rhythms of loss. “It’s like swimming,” she writes. “You stroke and kick to get to the outermost edge of the wave. You feel the momentum: go on go on go on. But always, something tugs you back into the scooped water, the furrows, those relentless grooves.”</p> <p>• The Furrows by Namwali Serpell is published by Hogarth (£16.99).

The Labour mayor has been criticised by some for his record on crime.</p> <p>Khan said more than half of shootings in London and nearly a quarter of homicides were believed to be linked to gangs. Gang exit schemes are being boosted by £2m.</p> <p>The mayor said: “I am concerned about a potential increase in violence this summer as the cost of living crisis deepens and threatens to reverse the progress we have made in tackling violent crime. Violence, like poverty, is not inevitable and the government must now do much more to show it shares my commitment to building a fairer, safer London for all.”</p> <p>The mayor said he had put a total of more than £8m into a gang exit programme that had helped hundreds of young people to move away from crime.</p> <p>The scheme, led by the charity Safer London, has helped 430 young people, with 83% significantly reducing or leaving gang activity. </p> <p>Sherry Peck, who leads Safer London, said she believed poverty, alienation and trauma left young people vulnerable to being groomed and recruited into violence.</p> <p>“There is so much being done to stop an increase in violence, but what we know is that social injustice and inequality are the drivers of increased violence,” she said. “It’s important to understand many young Londoners are growing up in incredibly toxic environments, which makes them more susceptible to violence and exploitation.”</p> <p>The fight to rescue vulnerable children can start with a youth worker meeting them at a place where they feel safe, such as the back of a bus, or a park bench.</p> <p>Symone, a Safer London caseworker, said: “This usually includes meeting in a coffee shop, library, or even a park or bus, and to be honest it’s more effective than meeting in an office environment, which can feel too formal for these children and young people.</p> <p>“Meeting them in places of their choosing is an essential part of building that trust and making sure they are involved in the decision making from the onset.”</p> <p>There is concern nationally about spiralling living costs leading to a rise in crime. In May, Andy Cooke, the chief inspector of constabulary, warned of an increase in thefts and other acquisitive crime as the economic crisis deepens.</p> <p>In a Guardian interview, Cooke said: “The impact of poverty, and the impact of lack of opportunity for people, does lead to an increase in crime. There’s no two ways about that.”</p> <p>Privately, police chiefs are clear about the link between poverty and crime.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/17/rather-than-sink-donald-trump-the-fbis-mar-a-lago-raid-could-save-him","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Rather than sink Donald Trump, the Mar-a-Lago raid could save him | Arwa Mahdawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/rather-than-sink-donald-trump-the-fbis-mar-a-lago-raid-could-save-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/rather-than-sink-donald-trump-the-fbis-mar-a-lago-raid-could-save-him","fields":{"headline":"Rather than sink Donald Trump, the FBI’s Mar-a-Lago raid could save him","trailText":"Being investigated under the Espionage Act would end most people’s political aspirations.

Think of the German youth dancing during the fall of the Berlin Wall, inspired by the tunes that came out of 1980s Detroit and Chicago, or LGBTQ people finding a family in the face of marginalisation in society.</p> <p>House music and dance have accompanied recent protests such as the Freedom to Dance rally in London in the summer of 2021, to encourage the lifting of Covid restrictions in the music and hospitality sectors. At the global Black Lives Matter demonstrations against police brutality and racism in 2020, people sometimes danced to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/11/how-the-electric-slide-became-the-black-lives-matter-protest-dance\">Electric Slide</a>, a 22-step sequence incorporating the grapevine move. Such dances bring forth messages of community to those who are thought of as outsiders.</p> <p>“The way we communicate on the dance floor is non-verbal, and this is part of why it’s so important to society as it provides other ways of being together than our day-to-day lives allow,” says Ruth Pethybridge, a <a href=\"https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/staff/dr-ruth-pethybridge\">senior lecturer in dance</a> at the University of Falmouth. “Relationships and communities are created between people who move together.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ca26af17ce933a4a51d89c9b86bfbe16db56b9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ca26af17ce933a4a51d89c9b86bfbe16db56b9b/0_0_1308_2330/561.jpg\" alt=\"Mike ‘Noodles’ Bredy leads dancers on TikTok.\" width=\"561\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike ‘Noodles’ Bredy leads house dancers on TikTok.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @mrbredydff</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pethybridge believes that house dance, a form of social freestyle dance, enables people to create their own signature styles through its high levels of improvisation and wide variety of stylistic influences. These include African dance (the rhythmic sounds of the drums, footwork and movement of the torso in harmony with the music); Caribbean and Afro-Latino dance; and Brazilian martial arts capoeira with its graceful acrobatic movements. Other influences include jazz, tap and voguing combined with fast and intricate footwork, jacking, lofting and floorwork similar to breakdancing. This mixture “is part of what makes it a community that can welcome difference and is often associated with ideas of freedom,” says Pethybridge.</p> <p>House dance emerged from Chicago and New York clubs in the late 1970s and 80s as a descendant of the post-disco era. DJs were experimenting with new ways of mixing and remixing records to keep people dancing for extended periods. House dance was freeing, intuitive and unrestricted as it exists and evolves as a social practice rather than having set rules to follow, which can be the case in ballet and ballroom. Such formalised styles of dance incorporate technical systems and are designed for performance. Comparable to the disco genre, house is a counterculture transcending sexual and racial identity.</p> <p>Sekou Heru, a 53-year-old dancer and choreographer, started out as a B-boy at the age of 10 and moved to New York aged 17 to pursue a career in the mecca of dance. At that time, says Heru, most of the trendy clubs that played house music had drag queens on the door. “They were the closest things to knowing that you were going to be safe as they would read people at the door and deny access to certain people.” House dance spread around the US mainly due to the New York dancers who went to universities in places such as Baltimore and Washington DC, bringing club music with them and forming house music and dance communities.</p> <p>Heru now teaches house dance around the world with a method he created called Rhythmmetrics which combines dance, fitness, martial arts and “sacred geometry”. Like other forms of street and social dance, house dance remains popular due to its ability to take different forms as our world becomes ever more interconnected – as demonstrated by the Haitian-Canadian record producer and DJ Kaytranada with his unique fusion of dance, house, electronic and hip-hop music, as well as the dancers who bring their own hybrid experiences to the dance floors.</p> <p>“Dance styles like house resist becoming too fixed and institutionalised, meaning they have endless potential to evolve and change,” says Pethybridge. “Which is surely what we need for society too.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/17/insurer-phoenix-life-is-indifferent-to-my-elderly-aunts-plight","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Insurer Phoenix Life is indifferent to my elderly aunt’s plight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/17/insurer-phoenix-life-is-indifferent-to-my-elderly-aunts-plight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/17/insurer-phoenix-life-is-indifferent-to-my-elderly-aunts-plight","fields":{"headline":"Insurer Phoenix Life is indifferent to my elderly aunt’s plight","trailText":"She paid £100,000 in to a plan in case she needed long-term care.

Like Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson, I’ve had a lovely summer holiday; unlike them, nobody seems to have been that bothered by my absence. With apologies to those who were hoping for more from Nimo, I’m writing to you this morning with news breaking in the US state of Wyoming, where Representative Liz Cheney, one of the few Republicans to hold Donald Trump accountable for the January 6 insurrection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/wyoming-republican-primary-liz-cheney-donald-trump-harriet-hageman\">has been handed an absolute drubbing</a>.</p> <p>In the last couple of hours, Cheney conceded defeat in the primary contest for her seat in the US House of Representatives to Trump’s preferred revenge candidate, standing 37 points behind Harriet Hageman with 95% of precincts reporting. Two years ago, Cheney won her primary with 73% of the vote. Hageman will go forward to the midterm elections in November – and with Democrats nowhere in Wyoming, she will be returned as the state’s sole congressional representative.</p> <p>Cheney’s defeat means that Washington DC will lose its most authoritative and best-known Republican critic of Trump – and yet some Democrats are willing to bet that the more extreme their opponents, the better they will do.</p> <p>Today’s newsletter, with the help of David Smith reporting from Wyoming, is about Liz Cheney – and what her result tells us about Trump’s continuing influence over the Republican party and American politics. That’s right after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Conservatives</strong></em> | An audio recording <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/leaked-audio-reveals-liz-truss-said-british-workers-needed-more-graft\">leaked to the Guardian</a> has revealed that Liz Truss said British workers lacked the “skill and application” of their overseas counterparts and needed “more graft”.

She opposes abortion rights, denies that human activity is responsible for the climate crisis and supports tax cuts for the wealthy. When Trump was president, she voted with him <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/liz-cheney/\">93% of the time</a>.</p> <p>All of which would appear to make her a solid match for Wyoming, which last elected a Democrat to her congressional seat in 1976. But Cheney differed from what now counts as the GOP mainstream on one crucial subject: the result of the 2020 presidential election, and in particular Donald Trump’s responsibility for the events that followed on January 6.</p> <p>She went on to be vice-chair and the most prominent voice of the House January 6 select committee, and, in the face of credible and numerous death threats, become an unlikely hero for Democrats nostalgic for a bygone age of (some) principled, bipartisan politics. </p> <p>But close to 70% of Wyoming voters went for Trump in 2020, and 70% of Republicans across the US believe his false claim that the election was stolen. As a direct result, Cheney will be out of a job on 3 January next year.</p> <p>“There wasn’t much of a note of sadness or disappointment in her concession speech,” said David Smith, speaking shortly after attending Cheney’s campaign event in Jackson, Wyoming. “She knew this was coming.” Even so, “it’s worth remembering how unthinkable this would have been a couple of years ago. It’s another symbolic indicator of how Trump has transformed his party.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>What happened last night?</p> <p>The margin against Cheney, even bigger than polls had suggested, represents an “absolutely crushing victory for Trump,” David said. “There’s no two ways about it. We’ve talked about what these primaries show us about Trump’s influence all year, but Wyoming was always the most watched.”</p> <p>For a sense of how deeply Cheney is opposed in her state, see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/13/liz-cheney-primary-election-wyoming-january-6\">David’s dispatch</a> published on Saturday, and this line from one critic: “​​She’s going to ‘educate’ us in the constitution and how ‘we’re wrong and she’s right.’ Well ... She’s gonna find out if she educated us or not.”</p> <p>While Trump’s false claims about the election and his role in the January 6 riot were clearly a crucial factor here, David also notes that Cheney’s opponents sought to argue that she was “interested in Washington over Wyoming, and had forgotten her constituents. And to some extent she leaned into that – she wasn’t discussing Wyoming policy at her concession speech, she was talking about the big national picture.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>How does the result in Wyoming fit into the wider story?</p> <p>One measure of the big picture for Republican critics of Trump, and of his enduring influence, might be an analysis of the fates of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol riot. Of those 10, four including Cheney have lost their primaries, four have retired and just two have survived.</p> <p>As David wrote last week, Cheney’s result can be seen as “a final national pivot away from the Bush-era establishment to the Make America Great Again movement – from old school conservatism to far-right populism.” Symbolically enough, David pointed out, Cheney’s father Dick, “Darth Vader of the Bush era himself,” was present last night “to see his daughter crushed by the MAGA movement. If you were looking for symbols, that’s pretty on-the-nose.”</p> <p>Trump hasn’t had it all his own way in 2022, David added, and the different outcomes are indicative of the contrasting political landscapes in deep red states like Wyoming and other more balanced races. “In Georgia, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/donald-trump-georgia-losses-republicans-maga\">the candidates he endorsed flopped</a>,” he said. “But he’s had a surge in congressional primaries recently. After some speculation that his grip is weakening, he’s reasserted himself.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Where does that leave Democrats?</p> <p>Grim as the depth of Republicans’ commitment to Trumpism is for American democracy, it isn’t necessarily the worst news for Joe Biden – or, at least, that’s what Democrats appear to think. One notable feature of this primary season (in races more likely to be competitive in November than Wyoming) has been Democratic funding of ads designed to elevate the chances of the most extreme Republican candidates, in the hope of ensuring unelectable opponents.</p> <p>The jury’s out on whether that’s a good idea. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/democrats-boosted-extremists-republican-primaries-was-that-wise\">a piece</a> on that strategy last week, Lauren Gambino quoted Richard Hasen, director of the Safeguarding Democracy project, who said that at a moment when the stolen election myth is such a potent force in American politics, the Democrats’ approach is “immoral and dangerous”.</p> <p>While Biden has endured dismal poll ratings, the picture has gotten a little better in recent weeks, with many on his own side appearing newly motivated by the supreme court’s ruling to overturn Roe v Wade and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/inflation-reduction-act-senate-democrats-pass\">the unexpected passage of a $739bn healthcare and climate bill</a>.</p> <p>That has changed the political weather: polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight still expects Republicans to win the House, but it <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/\">now views</a> Democrats as slight favourites to keep control of the Senate. (One reason why, as Adam Gabbatt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/mehmet-oz-herschel-walker-jd-vance-republican-senate\">lays out here</a>, is the calibre of some of the celebrity candidates the GOP has chosen.)</p> <p>Even if this helps in November, though, Cheney’s result and the Democratic strategy still point to the looming threat in 2024: a national election where Republican positions are defined by their most extreme anti-democratic voices – with Trump himself at the top of the ticket.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What will Cheney do next?</p> <p>Cheney appeared to have accepted the inevitably of her defeat some time ago. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/05/dick-cheney-trump-liz-cheney-threat-republic\">An ad featuring her father</a> excoriating Trump appeared more likely to appeal to a national audience than the party faithful at home. She has stayed in Washington when she might have been expected to be campaigning on the ground in Wyoming. And she has held back much of her considerable war chest.</p> <p>Cheney will keep her role on the January 6 committee for the rest of the year. Many suspect that one reason she kept some money back is a larger ambition in the future: a run at the presidency. In her concession speech, she dropped a clear hint about that prospect, saying: “Abraham Lincoln was defeated in elections for the Senate and House before he won the most important election of all.”</p> <p>Most analysts believe that she would be a long-shot candidate – and, as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/15/liz-cheneys-political-life-is-likely-ending-just-beginning/\">this Washington Post piece</a> reports, she is herself “clear-eyed” about her prospects. Instead, she may see her possible role as a spoiler for Trump should he run again.</p> <p>But as David also noted: “The Cheneys always play a very long game. Her father was chief of staff to Gerald Ford decades before he was vice president. I assume Liz Cheney will view this as one setback in a very long story.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/16/demolition-is-an-act-of-violence-the-architects-reworking-buildings-instead-of-tearing-them-down\">Oliver Wainwright spoke</a> to the architects who believe that “demolition is an act of violence” and are <strong>breathing new life into old buildings</strong> instead. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Ballon d’Or winners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/when-megan-rapinoe-met-ada-hegerberg-euro-2022-everyone-was-late-to-the-party\">Ada Hegerberg and Megan Rapinoe’s conversation</a> about <strong>the state of women’s football</strong> is full of insight on how to capitalise on England’s success in the Euros – and features this bracing quote from Rapinoe: “Welcome, everybody, to the party.

It was a flop: the crowd wasn’t enthused, and the band disbanded soon after, drifting apart from one another. That was until 2016, when their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/16/panchiko-visual-purple-little-known-bands-surprise-fame\">album turned up in a charity shop.</a> The person who bought the CD made it their mission to find out who was behind the album. Thus began Panchiko’s journey into the cultural zeitgeist. For years, internet sleuths looked for Panchiko – and eventually found them. The former bandmates were shocked that, after all these years, they had, without their knowledge, acquired a dedicated fanbase. Now in their 40s, the band have come together for a US tour that is already partly sold out.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/the-upside-sign-up-for-our-weekly-email\">Sign up here</a> for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday</strong></p> <h2>Bored at work?</h2> <p>And finally, the Guardian’s crosswords to keep you entertained throughout the day – with plenty more on the Guardian’s Puzzles app for <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1487780661?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.guardian.puzzles&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\">Android</a>.

Neither was the case when the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/thewildingairfield.co.uk/thewildingairfield/The-Site-History\">US air force 351st Bomb Group departed Polebrook Airfield</a> at the end of the second world war, however. In fact, not much has happened on this 36-hectare site in Northamptonshire since 1945, when the requisitioned land was returned to its owner, the pioneering natural scientist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/22/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Miriam Rothschild</a>. She made a conscious decision to simply leave it … and leave it … and let nature reclaim the land, its three concrete runways and air force buildings that were home to nearly 3,000 American airmen during the war, Captain (and Hollywood superstar) Clark Gable among them.</p> <p>Give or take a failed forestation scheme in the 1970s, it’s barely been touched by human hand since, and the former airfield slowly evolved into the private Polebrook Airfield nature reserve. Rothschild began this rewilding scheme half a century before the term was invented and became fashionable. In the 77 years since, a variety of habitats have taken hold on the flat, formerly featureless land: woodland, dense scrubland and open grassy areas in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54c0d8f5e2e174edd3cf60d27c390fe9f8f4fe0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54c0d8f5e2e174edd3cf60d27c390fe9f8f4fe0c/4_76_2189_1314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The interior of Birch View cabin, where the writer stayed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The interior of Birch View cabin, where the writer stayed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canopy and Stars</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joanna and Fin Broadbent, who was brought up on this land, bought it together with his parents in 2017, and have continued Rothschild’s<strong> </strong>good work. And in March the couple opened two low-impact holiday cabins here – and named the scheme the <a href=\"https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/northamptonshire/the-wilding-airfield\">Wilding Airfield</a> to generate a bit of income to help maintain the reserve. As he shows me around the grounds, Fin tells me, “Although there is space to do it, we didn’t want to go down the route of ‘Let’s build 20 cabins and a communal barbecue area on this nice piece of land.’ We want it to be a place where guests can escape and be amongst nature.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We discovered the shell of the generator room, covered in graffiti, and an almost perfectly intact bomb shelter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You can certainly do that. The airfield is 12 miles from Peterborough and only four from the beautifully preserved Georgian market town of Oundle (“Market charter granted in 972,” reads the welcome sign). It’s hard to picture a prettier, more quintessentially English town. The Saturday market is still going strong and we pick up homemade poacher’s pie and local produce for the barbecue, and wander the streets of elegantly worked limestone buildings, still wearing their Union Jack bunting from the jubilee weekend, before heading to our base. </p> <p>Our cabin, <a href=\"https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/northamptonshire/the-wilding-airfield/birch-view\">Birch View</a>, sits on the end of the former third runway, the odd patch of concrete still visible under the moss, lichen and grass. It is so secluded, surrounded by nothing but white birch trees and birdsong, that we float into our own little world the moment we arrive. The cabin is compact and beautifully decked out, with picture windows, a breakfast bar, one double bed squeezed in at one end of the cabin and a second directly above it in the mezzanine. There’s a well-equipped kitchenette (and a generous hamper, including breakfast and prosecco), but we had more fun outside, building a fire in the firepit, barbecuing on its grill (there’s a wood-fired pizza oven too) and sloshing in and out of the large hot tub on a lovely summer’s evening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f69d1635e463ffdcd5adc0cf748f9910bf74f60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f69d1635e463ffdcd5adc0cf748f9910bf74f60/125_333_5591_3355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Birch View cabin, which sleeps four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birch View cabin, which sleeps four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canopy and Stars</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s the isolation that makes this such a special place. The owners are on hand, but leave you to it, and we didn’t see anyone else all weekend. But I did feel a pang of cabin envy when we spied the reserve’s second holiday property through the trees. The two-storey <a href=\"https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/northamptonshire/the-wilding-airfield/two-pines\">Two Pines Treehouse</a> (in the top picture) looks cooler than our cabin, is raised on stilts, surrounded by a roped-off terrace and (it says on the website) has a king-size bed and a William Holland copper bath sitting on the deck.</p> <p>The dense woodland is crisscrossed by neatly mown grass paths or corridors, which are also used as thoroughfares by the fluffle of cute rabbits. We used them to explore the reserve, and saw turtle doves, bullfinches, blue tits and goldfinches along the way. I <em>think</em> we also spotted <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/butterflies/marbled-white\">marbled white butterfly</a> and <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/moths/five-spot-burnet\">five-spot Burnet</a> moths, among others – but as a townie, I couldn’t be sure. (Given the wealth of wildlife here, the cabin could do with a spotters’ chart of birds, butterflies and wildflowers, rather than just the laminated list, and perhaps binoculars, too.)</p> <p>In an adjacent field that’s still home to a second world war hangar, we saw red kites swooping down to prey on young ground-nesting lapwings, only to be chased off by their protective parents. Most of the other airfield buildings were broken up for hardcore in the 1960s, and those that are left are hidden in the undergrowth. But with directions from Fin we discovered the atmospheric shells of a couple that give a real feel of the airfield’s history: the two-storey generator room, now covered in graffiti, and an almost perfectly intact concrete bomb shelter in the unusual shape of a church nave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a518b6d842a810a1e448ac343edce255cdbeb80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a518b6d842a810a1e448ac343edce255cdbeb80/0_532_4680_2808/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An RAF Boeing Fortress Mark I takes off from Polebrook during the second world war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An RAF Boeing Fortress Mark I takes off from Polebrook during the second world war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reserve’s other fascinating landmarks are the large outdoor sculptures by Fin’s father, the artist <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/thewildingairfield.co.uk/barneybroadbent/home/\">Barney Broadbent</a>, dotted around the far end of the site.

Julia Garner is our central concern as Jane, five months into her job as assistant to a domineering movie boss, known only as “He”, who is heard ranting on the phone but remains unseen. She gets intimations of his darker actions – unexplained invoices, after-hours meetings with young female actors, the appearance of a new “assistant” – but are Jane’s suspicions enough to risk her position by complaining?

This was based on a cost of about £2.85bn to nationalise the big five supply firms – British Gas, E.ON, EDF, Scottish Power and Ovo. As a comparison, the government spent £2.2bn bailing out another firm, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/22/bulb-energy-which-supplies-17m-customers-collapses-into-administration\">Bulb</a>.</p> <p>The Green plan would also involve the energy price cap – the maximum households can pay – being put back to the level of last autumn, before this April’s increase of nearly £700 a year for the average household.</p> <p>Putting this in place throughout the autumn and winter would cost about £37bn, the party said, compared with the £29bn estimated cost of Labour’s proposal to keep the cap at its current level.</p> <p>The cost would be paid for in part by tightening up the government’s windfall tax on oil and gas firms’ extra profits from higher global prices, and the party also proposes higher taxes for very wealthy people.</p> <p>Carla Denyer, a co-leader of the Greens alongside Adrian Ramsay, said the party would also aim to create more energy efficiency by introducing differential tariffs under which households that use a lot of power face proportionally rising prices, with exceptions for people with disabilities or chronic health conditions.</p> <p>The party is already committed to a mass programme of home insulation to improve energy efficiency.</p> <p>“This experiment with an energy supply market has failed,” Denyer said. “Only the government can intervene at the scale required to avoid a catastrophe this winter.”</p> <p>She said there was “nationwide anxiety about the prospect of unpayable energy bills”, adding: “Other parties have only offered to fix energy prices at current levels, but we know these are already unaffordable. We would return energy prices to an affordable level.”</p> <p>Denyer said: “By bringing the big five energy retail companies into public ownership, setting the price of energy at an affordable rate and absorbing the global price rises, the government could make sure everybody can afford to get through this cost of living crisis. At the same time, it will mean this public service will be able to be run in the public interest, instead of in the interest of profit-making.”</p> <p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for a freeze on energy bills at current levels. Boris Johnson’s government has said more must be done to help households with energy costs, but that policies must be decided by his successor.</p> <p>Liz Truss, the favourite to take over as prime minister, has said she is focused on tax cuts rather than direct help with energy costs, though the latter is not ruled out. Rishi Sunak, the other contender, has set out proposals including a cut to VAT on energy.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/17/australias-regional-housing-boom-slows-but-housing-stress-still-a-major-concern","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"Australia’s regional property boom slows but housing stress still a major concern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/australias-regional-housing-boom-slows-but-housing-stress-still-a-major-concern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/australias-regional-housing-boom-slows-but-housing-stress-still-a-major-concern","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s regional property boom slows but housing stress still a major concern","trailText":"Beach and country lifestyle areas show market weakness after record-breaking rises during the pandemic","byline":"Caitlin Cassidy","body":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/house-prices-and-rents-surge-in-regional-australia-amid-influx-of-arrivals-from-cities\">regional housing boom</a> is beginning to slow in trophy hotspots across New South Wales and Queensland after years of “phenomenal” growth, although overall the market is still outpacing capital cities.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.corelogic.com.au/our-data/market-trends\">CoreLogic</a>’s latest regional market update found 10 regions registered modest value declines in the three months to July, with beach and country lifestyle areas the first to show market weakness after record-breaking rises during the pandemic.</p> <p>Regional growth slowed from a peak of 6.4% in December 2021 to 0.2% over the three months to July.

I didn’t want to look like a person with Down’s syndrome. It took me a long time – but I have accepted it and I’m celebrating it now.”</p> <p>All her life, her parents had “mainstreamed” their daughter, sending her to the same school as her three siblings and encouraging a fierce independence in her. She’d always thought she was just like the rest of the family, so finding out that her physical appearance was related to a condition that only she had was a shock. Her father – lovingly, gently – told her that, if she really wanted, there were plastic surgery procedures available to alter the signs of Down’s syndrome in her features: “I thought about it, but decided not to – and I just kind of got on with the rest of my life.”</p> <p>Getting on with her life has involved two decades of advocating for people with disabilities, being nominated for Australian of the Year 2022 and creating a hugely acclaimed theatre show, You Know We Belong Together, which comes to the Edinburgh festival this month. When it premiered in 2018 in Perth, the show sold out. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"227f70d1ebac129bf7f7cbe596907e62f7e8debf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/227f70d1ebac129bf7f7cbe596907e62f7e8debf/0_0_2400_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ray Meagher filming Home and Away in Sydney in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I never miss an episode’: Ray Meagher filming Home and Away in Sydney in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matrix/GC Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It was huge,” Hales says, sitting in the rehearsal room of the <a href=\"https://bsstc.com.au/\">Black Swan</a> theatre company in Western Australia. “I’ve been having people from the street saying, ‘I saw your show. You’re an inspiration, Julia!’”</p> <p>Black Swan’s production of You Know We Belong Together begins with Hales’ love for Home and Away, the Australian soap that is Neighbours’ more beachy (and saucy) cousin. The stage is made to look like the show’s iconic diner, the Bait Shop, run by Hales’ favourite character, gruff yet warm Alf Stewart, played by Ray Meagher, who has been on the show since it first aired in 1988.</p> <p>“I just love the drama and romance, the cast,” Hales says. “I never miss an episode.” In her show, Hales explains her feelings about never seeing an actor with Down’s syndrome on Home and Away, and her dream to be the first. She already has a plan for who she’d play: Clare, “a long-lost adopted granddaughter to Alf Stewart, who wanted to find her birth family”.</p> <p>On stage she is joined by six other performers with Down’s syndrome who share their own dreams: the dancers Lauren Marchbank and Joshua Bott, the Indigenous painter and performer Patrick Carter, actor Tina Fielding and a married couple, Melissa and Mark Junor, who met at a dancing class and recreate their wedding dance on stage.</p> <p>“All of the parents of the cast say they always get asked the same question: if you could take Down’s syndrome away from your child, would you? And every single one of them says no,” says Clare Watson, who co-wrote the show with Hales and playwright Finn O’Branagáin. “They love their child for who they are and that is absolutely part of who they are.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39f2c8e66a0868b79ec53c416fb9384970d62d0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39f2c8e66a0868b79ec53c416fb9384970d62d0e/0_40_5825_3495/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Hales in You Know We Belong Together.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Hales in You Know We Belong Together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toni Wilkinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Hales and Watson first met, the show was focused on the challenges of dating with disabilities. “But just as a side topic, Julia started talking about Home and Away and I saw her light up – you could see this passion,” Watson says. During development they reached out to the show’s producers and were invited to visit the set in Sydney. Hales ended up working with the producers to film a denouement for her play: a scene where Clare (portrayed by Hales) runs into Alf (Meagher), and the pair muse on the beauty of Summer Bay before heading off for a spot of fishing. </p> <p>The show also explains the horrific history of how people with Down’s syndrome were institutionalised in Australia. Until the 1980s, Australian parents were encouraged to surrender children with Down’s syndrome to the state. Hales was born after these practices had mostly ended; as she observes, had she been conceived a generation later, there is a chance that she wouldn’t have been born at all. The development of screening technology means that, in Australia, 90% of pregnancies where Down’s syndrome is detected are terminated.</p> <p>Hales’ late mother didn’t know her baby had Down’s syndrome until the doctor first saw Julia. “My mum was quite sad when she found out,” Hales says. “But she and my dad loved me anyway.” The show is dedicated to her mum, who spent her life fighting for Hales to be given as many opportunities as her siblings, encouraged her to enter tertiary education and helped her move out and live independently at 21. </p> <p>Hales is thrilled to be arriving in Edinburgh but her true dream remains unfulfilled. “I’m hoping people from Home and Away will see the show and maybe say, ‘Julia, we would love to have you on our show – if you have time, come audition,’” says Hales.</p> <p>“I love it – ‘If you have time’,” laughs Watson. “You’ll say, ‘I’ll have to check my schedule, I’m quite busy with international tours at the moment.’ This is the thing to know about Jules: she has a show that has had standing ovations every night, and she’s taking it to the world. For some people, that’s an unimaginable zenith. But Jules is like, ‘Yeah I am excited – but I still have my goal.’”</p> <p>What is Hales most proud of? “Having all my friends out there, when we don’t get to be on screens very often. I want people in Edinburgh to understand how we were treated in the past and say, ‘OK, we can’t let that happen again.’ And I want people with disabilities to say, ‘Wow we can be just like Julia and be on screens and TV.’ Because I’ve always wanted to change the world to make it better.”</p> <p>The three of us laugh together, in wonder at the force of Hales’ speech. “You see what I mean?” Watson says, smiling.</p> <ul> <li><p>You Know We Belong Together is at the <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/performance-dance/you-know-we-belong-together\">Southbank Centre, London</a>, 18-20 August; the <a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/events/you-know-we-belong-together\">Lyceum, Edinburgh</a>, 24-27 August; and <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/events/whats-on/theatre/2022/you-know-we-belong-together.html\">Sydney Opera House</a> 6-10 September.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/17/tideway-boss-paid-nearly-1m-despite-thames-super-sewer-project-delays","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Tideway boss paid nearly £1m despite Thames ‘super-sewer’ project delays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/tideway-boss-paid-nearly-1m-despite-thames-super-sewer-project-delays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/tideway-boss-paid-nearly-1m-despite-thames-super-sewer-project-delays","fields":{"headline":"Tideway boss paid nearly £1m despite Thames ‘super-sewer’ project delays","trailText":"Andy Mitchell received bonuses on top of £489,000 salary last year as forecast tunnel cost rose to £4.3bn","byline":"Alex Lawson","body":"<p>The executive overseeing construction of London’s “super sewer” under the Thames has been awarded bonuses that doubled his pay to nearly £1m despite delays and cost over-runs on the flagship project.</p> <p>With executive pay in the water industry already under scrutiny, Tideway has revealed it paid its chief executive, Andy Mitchell, a total package of £928,000 for the year to 31 March 2022, up 7.5% from £863,000 a year earlier.</p> <p>Mitchell almost doubled his £489,000 base salary through a £215,000 bonus and £206,000 granted under a long-term incentive plan, plus benefits, company filings show, after receiving 95% of the bonus he could have raked in under the company’s bonus scheme.

However, during the pandemic in 2020, Tideway announced the completion date would be pushed back by nine months to the first half of 2025, with the forecast total cost rising by £233m to £4.13bn.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.tideway.london/news/press-releases/2022/june/tideway-publishes-annual-report-and-accounts-following-completion-of-tunnelling/#sub-nav\">its annual report</a>, Tideway said the capital cost of the sewer was now £4.3bn, an increase of 2% since its last update. The firm raised an extra £300m in March by issuing green bonds, which are designed to support environmental projects.</p> <p>Its construction is also being funded by Londoners, with Thames Water customers paying an extra £20 to £25 on their bills.</p> <p>Investors including the German financial services behemoth Allianz and the fund manager Dalmore Capital have also put money into the project.</p> <p>The director of the High Pay Centre, Luke Hildyard, condemned Mitchell’s pay packet. He said: “This is an administrative role providing a vital public service. It shouldn’t really require a vast bonus on top of a salary already far beyond the reality of 99.99% of the population.</p> <p>“We are seeing real public anger about the cost of living crisis and boards and pay committees shouldn’t be complacent about the inflammatory nature of top pay awards and the social and economic instability they could cause.”</p> <p>In total, Tideway’s board were paid £2.97m last year, up from £2.61m a year earlier. Its high profile members include non-executive chairman and former Tarmac chief Sir Neville Simms, who received £285,000, and Heathrow airport boss John Holland-Kaye and former Mitie chief Ruby McGregor-Smith, who were each paid £64,000 for their roles as non-executive directors.</p> <p>Mitchell is an infrastructure industry veteran who has worked on a string of projects including Hong Kong airport and the Thameslink rail line. He took the Tideway role after leaving his position in 2014 as programme director at Crossrail, the London rail line which opened in May, three and a half years late.</p> <p>In 2020, Mitchell was mistakenly overpaid £206,000 and the former chief operating officer Mark Sneesby £143,000 under the long-term incentive plan. They later paid the money back after the “administrative error”.</p> <p>The company said in the annual report that “there continues to be a very competitive labour market and it is important for the project’s success that we offer an attractive overall compensation and benefits package”.</p> <p>Michael Queen, chair of Tideway’s remuneration committee, said: “Our company annual bonus targets are set with the aim of promoting individual and collective motivation to realise the company’s objectives and purpose, focusing on health and safety, the time, cost and quality of build and importantly the impact on our communities and support to our people.”</p> <p>The Tideway project aims to prevent the spillage of millions of tonnes of raw sewage into the River Thames each year. London currently relies on a 150-year-old sewer system built for a population less than half of its current size.</p> <p>In Tideway’s annual report, Mitchell said: “Sewage pollution in the UK’s watercourses has never been higher up the public agenda.

There’s always been a People’s Front for the Liberation of Judea aspect,” a former Conservative adviser who worked in Northern Ireland said.</p> <p>“So for the candidates it’ll be high risk, as well as annoying in terms of having [to] devote resources, but it’ll be like Christmas for the local party, many of whom feel neglected and forgotten about.”</p> <p>After years of often not even being able to vote for a Tory candidate – the party stood in only four Northern Ireland constituencies in the last general election – each member now has an actual vote for the next prime minister in what is an electorate that represents a tiny fraction of the UK’s population.</p> <p>Before Wednesday’s hustings and Tuesday’s in Perth – both opportunities for the candidates to portray themselves as defenders of an imperilled union – Truss described herself as a “child of the union”, though she attracted ridicule for her Sherlock Holmes-like conclusion that Sinn Féin was attempting to “drive a wedge” between Northern Ireland and Britain.</p> <p>Sunak has meanwhile pledged that Northern Ireland would be central to his plan to “restore trust, rebuild our economy and unite our great nation” and promised that he would fix the protocol, emphasising what he described as his record as “an experienced international negotiator”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/21/liz-truss-v-rishi-sunak-tory-pm-contenders-differ-policy\">Truss v Sunak: how do Tory PM contenders differ on policy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Henry Hill, deputy editor of Conservative Home, Sunak is the candidate who has the most to fear from Belfast, given reports that, as chancellor, he had opposed the protocol bill, which would give ministers the power to scrap parts of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and EU.</p> <p>“I think there’s a danger for Sunak, depending on who ends up questioning him, that he gets asked a question he’s managed to avoid answering so far, which is: ‘OK, so the protocol bill comes into law. What do you do with it? What’s your plan for fixing the border?’ He doesn’t have one.”</p> <p>Others are less convinced, with the former Tory adviser suggesting that Northern Ireland Tories won’t necessarily be won over by Truss’s red, white and blue bluster.</p> <p>“The protocol is also something that affects business and we’re talking about people who live in Northern Ireland and are in business. They’re also – in comparison to other unionists in Northern Ireland – people who tend to be more liberal, which might make some lean away from the rightwing positions taken by Truss.”</p> <p>Aside from battling for a few hundred votes from Tory members in Northern Ireland, there’s the added fact that Truss and Sunak will still be playing to the wider audience of the 160,000 membership.</p> <p>Hill adds: “Members won’t necessarily be tuning in but they will pick up on what is covered. There’s also Conservative MPs, including a lot who have become latter day unionists after originally supporting the protocol. They’re going to be looking for ways to underline their own pro-union credentials and will want to hear what is said.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/17/younger-viewers-shun-traditional-tv-channels-as-90-opt-for-streaming-services","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Younger viewers shun traditional TV channels as 90% opt for streaming services","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/17/younger-viewers-shun-traditional-tv-channels-as-90-opt-for-streaming-services","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/17/younger-viewers-shun-traditional-tv-channels-as-90-opt-for-streaming-services","fields":{"headline":"Younger viewers shun traditional TV channels as 90% opt for streaming services","trailText":"Ofcom says viewers aged 16 to 24 spend just 53 minutes a day on average watching broadcast TV","byline":"Mark Sweney","body":"<p>Watching traditional TV channels has almost stopped among younger viewers, with 90% of 18- to 24-year-olds heading straight to their favourite streaming service, according to a report by the media regulator Ofcom.</p> <p>The report, which found that Netflix is the most common destination for younger viewers to seek out content, highlights a rapidly widening generation gap in viewing habits.</p> <p>Viewers aged between 16 and 24 spend just 53 minutes a day on average watching traditional broadcast TV – a fall of two-thirds over the last decade – seven times less than those aged 65 and over.

Soon afterwards, on the advice of his tutor, he journeyed to England and enrolled for a term at the University of Warwick, where Thompson was a lecturer.</p> <p>“I went specifically to study with him, having read his book <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/13539/the-making-of-the-english-working-class-by-thompson-e-p/9780141976952\">The Making of the English Working Class</a><em>,</em>” Horenstein tells me over the phone from his home in Boston. A few years later, when his interest shifted from history to photography, Thompson would still be as big an influence on Horenstein’s work as the esteemed photographers he studied under at the Rhode Island School of Design – the likes of <a href=\"https://www.icp.org/browse/archive/constituents/aaron-siskind?all/all/all/all/0\">Aaron Siskind</a>, <a href=\"https://www.icp.org/browse/archive/constituents/harry-callahan?all/all/all/all/0\">Harry Callahan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.icp.org/browse/archive/constituents/minor-white?all/all/all/all/0\">Minor White</a>. “I soon figured out that the life of a historian was pretty dull, whereas the life of a photographer wasn’t,” Horenstein says, laughing. “But what Thompson taught me, I tried to bring to my photography. I sought out working people whose voices would not usually get out there.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I soon figured out the life of a historian was pretty dull, whereas the life of a photographer wasn’t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since then, Horenstein has amassed a <a href=\"https://www.horenstein.com/\">huge archive</a> of images of mostly “ordinary” people and published several photo books on American working-class pursuits such as baseball, horse racing and country music. Now comes <a href=\"https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/products/speedward-1972\">Speedway 1972</a>, an early series of evocative black-and-white portraits shot at stock car racing events at circuits in Seekonk, Massachusetts and Thompson, Connecticut. “What I’m drawn to is community,” he says, citing his brother-in-law, a speedway driver, as his original conduit to this grassroots culture of battered cars and reckless velocity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa1b582d0ce88ac779b3babd4d4a793a0e9662eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa1b582d0ce88ac779b3babd4d4a793a0e9662eb/0_0_1500_1503/998.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Horenstein - Speedway 1972\" width=\"998\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>“I was still in grad school and I was looking for an opportunity,” he writes in his short introduction. “There had to be good pictures for a historian-with-a-camera in training.”</p> <p>The passage of time has imbued his portraits with an even deeper aura of authenticity, not least because Horenstein’s ordinary people – blue-collar, white, small-town – hail from a time when classic American workwear was practical rather than fashionable. Many of the men wear grime-stained T-shirts, shapeless work trousers and heavy boots while the young favour denim and plaid, their unruly hairstyles a testament to the lingering legacy of the hippy 60s. Teenage couples and groups of youngsters attest to the fact that stock car racing provided a family night out in provincial communities where the best drivers were often local heroes.</p> <p>Though the series is punctuated with images of beat-up cars and proudly posing drivers, it is the punters that Horenstein mostly trains his eye on, framing his subjects in complete darkness or against the silhouettes of makeshift buildings and rows of half-empty wooden benches. Their presence is starkly dramatic, even if many seem gauche and awkward in front of his camera. “I did the series when I was a baby photographer and still in awe of my heroes.” he says, referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/mar/31/the-best-of-weegees-new-york-street-photography-in-pictures\">Usher “Weegee” Felig</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/oct/08/city-of-light-brassai-paris-in-pictures-photography\">Gyula “Brassaï” Halasz,</a> the two iconic night photographers to whom he has dedicated the book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5367f121c47d0f6bb3f3714c38a6e0729e3675b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5367f121c47d0f6bb3f3714c38a6e0729e3675b6/0_0_4134_4139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(kids with balloons)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Though he is primarily a portrait photographer, Horenstein’s work is also characterised by a profound sense of place. For his best-known book, <a href=\"https://www.horenstein.com/stills/honky-tonk\">Honky Tonk</a>, first published in 2003 and reissued in an extended edition in 2012, he made formal portraits of country icons such as Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton and Ralph Stanley, but also lesser-known performers like the Willis Brothers, who sometimes provided backing for the great Hank Williams, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeFord_Bailey\">DeFord Bailey</a>, a pioneering prewar African American country musician and founding member of the Grand Ole Opry, the famous country music venue in Nashville. He also photographed people queuing outside the Opry in their country and western finery, and the denizens of down-home bars such as Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge in Nashville and the Hillbilly Ranch in Boston. One particularly atmospheric image is called <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/37574-600rBWneg_11_drunk_dancing.jpg\">Drunk Dancing, Merchants Cafe, Nashville</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f38d2daa6003b07b1467632d07d47b8713f1471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f38d2daa6003b07b1467632d07d47b8713f1471/1366_280_2694_3368/800.jpg\" alt=\"‘I’m an observer’ … Henry Horenstein.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m an observer’ … Henry Horenstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“You had to be quick, but that was OK,” he says of his fly-on-the-wall approach not just to to documentary but also portraiture. “The performers didn’t tend to give me much time. But I was not that interested in getting into their world and they were not interested in mine. I’m an observer. That’s what has worked for me.”</p> <p>Horenstein’s interest in music dates back to his time at Warwick in the mid-60s, when he would travel to London most weekends to immerse himself in the city’s burgeoning folk scene. “I went to so many small bars and function rooms with folding chairs to see the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/05/bert-jansch\">Bert Jansch</a>. Towards the end of my time there, he had formed Pentangle. I remember there was a photographer who would shoot the performers and then bring the prints back the following week and sell them. Looking back, that too that may have made me think about photography as a way of making a living.”</p> <p>Back then Horenstein had no idea there was a distinction between documentary and art photography. “There just wasn’t much art photography being made. Everyone wanted to be a member of [photo agency] <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/\">Magnum</a>; they weren’t interested in museum shows.” His images, though resolutely traditional, resonate across the years, both in their formal starkness and their insistence on the importance of the ordinary and the communal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/aug/17/a-night-at-the-races-out-on-the-speedway-in-pictures-henry-horenstein\">A night at the races: out on the Speedway – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, when he showed the speedway series to some of the students he teaches at the Rhode Island School of Design, a young girl instantly recognised one of the locations as her hometown of Thompson. “It turns out that her grandfather and the owner of the racetrack were fishing buddies.” he says. “She took the pictures back there with her and managed to get about 80% of the people in them identified, because hardly anyone left that little town.”</p> <p>The Thompson speedway track is still operating, he tells me, but the sport is not as popular as it was in its heyday. In the interim, the photographs have assumed a social and historical importance. “They are a records of a local community from another time. An almost lost time.” EP Thompson, one senses, would have approved.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/collections/frontpage/products/speedward-1972\">Speedway 1972 is published by Stanley/Barker</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/17/freeport-turbocapitalism-tramples-over-british-democracy-teesside-plymouth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Welcome to the freeport, where turbocapitalism tramples over British democracy | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/freeport-turbocapitalism-tramples-over-british-democracy-teesside-plymouth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/freeport-turbocapitalism-tramples-over-british-democracy-teesside-plymouth","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to the freeport, where turbocapitalism tramples over British democracy","trailText":"From Teesside to Plymouth, these ‘special economic zones’ are shrouded in secrecy – and only benefit big business, says Guardian columnist George Monbiot","byline":"George Monbiot","body":"<p>Democracy is the problem that capital is always striving to solve. To maintain its rates of profit, it seeks to drive down the taxes it must pay and annul the regulations that defend the living world, workers and consumers. This tends to be unpopular.

Distraction works pretty well, especially when it takes the form of culture wars. The billionaire press does a sterling job at misrepresenting our choices – to favour the very rich.

One approach is to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/freeports-monitoring-and-evaluation-strategy/freeports-programme-monitoring-and-evaluation-strategy\">create places</a> where the usual rules do not apply and citizens have less decision-making power. I’m talking about “freeports”. In crucial respects, these “special economic zones” operate as if they were outside a <a href=\"https://teesvalley-ca.gov.uk/teesside-freeport/\">nation’s borders</a>. They are the equivalent of the royal forests of medieval England. Forest derives from the Latin <em>foris</em>, which means outside. The forests were hunting estates where the king’s private interests overrode the rights of the common people, elevating them beyond the usual laws of the land. The Westminster government has so far designated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/03/eight-free-ports-low-tax-zones-created-england\">eight freeports</a> in England, and the Scottish government is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-61864125\">considering bids for two</a>.</p> <p>Their objectives were set by an advisory panel chaired by the two most ardent supporters of freeports in the government: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/liz-truss-hosts-first-meeting-of-the-freeports-advisory-panel\">Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak</a>. The panel was composed of two public officials, two economists, five industry lobbyists, one cities advocate, one venture capitalist and two members of dark-money thinktanks (lobby groups that refuse to reveal who funds them).

Companies using a freeport can claim a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statement-on-the-designation-of-freeport-tax-sites\">wide range</a> of customs privileges and tax cuts. These include business rate relief, which will deprive central government of income (because local authorities will be fully compensated by the Exchequer for the loss of rates), and employers’ national insurance relief, which creates a two-tier workforce: cheap and even cheaper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/13/low-taxes-and-levelling-up-the-great-freeport-experiment-comes-to-teesside\">Low taxes and levelling up: the great freeport experiment comes to Teesside</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government has also offered a radical curtailment of planning rules in these zones. It’s not clear, since its attempt to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958420/MHCLG-Planning-Consultation.pdf\">demolish</a> much of the planning system collapsed in the wake of a spectacular <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57535928\">byelection defeat</a>, whether this promise still holds. Like most important aspects of freeports, the policy is opaque and inscrutable. But the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/924644/FINAL_-_200923_-_OFF_SEN_-_Freeports_Con_Res_-_FINAL.pdf\">original proposals</a>, which have nowhere been publicly amended, offer businesses “permitted development rights” and “local development orders”, allowing them to build without the usual planning requirements.</p> <p>Another offer is a “<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/935493/Freeports_Bidding_Prospectus_web_final.pdf\">simpler framework</a> for environmental assessment”. “Simpler”, like “streamlined” and “flexible”, is government-speak for the removal of public protections. On Teesside, environmental standards already seem to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/06/dead-shellfish-beaches-safety-secrecy-britain\">junked </a>to make way for the coming freeport.</p> <p>A further freeport promise is to “identify opportunities for regulatory flexibility and new regulatory sandboxes”. A regulatory sandbox is a place where you can test new products in a real setting, without being constrained by the usual rules. The government gives the following example: a company trialling new automated vehicles, which, in a freeport, would “not require regulatory approval”. This sounds to me like a formula for putting workers at risk. In none of the government documents that I’ve read on freeports is there a word about democracy.</p> <p>There is a further, extraordinary aspect, which is beginning to come to public attention. While the “tax sites” and “customs sites” in a freeport cover a maximum of a few hundred hectares, the operators are allowed to set an “outer boundary” with a diameter of up to 45km (28 miles). Where a “very strong case”, with a “clear economic rationale”, is made, the area can be even wider. There must have been some very strong cases, because some of these zones are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/maps-of-uk-freeports\">75km from point to point</a>. The Plymouth and South Devon freeport incorporates the whole of Dartmoor and the entire South Hams region. The Southampton freeport includes the New Forest and the Isle of Wight. The East Midlands zone extends from Nottingham to Leicester and Burton upon Trent to Upper Broughton. In Suffolk and Essex, everywhere from Sudbury to Felixstowe and Needham Market to Clacton-on-Sea is included. The Humber freeport boundary extends from Spurn Head to Howden; Teesside’s from Peterlee to Staithes and Redcar to Dinsdale; East London’s from Barking to London Gateway, and Liverpool’s from Birkenhead to Urmston.</p> <p>What these boundaries mean is, as always, clear as mud. When I asked the government to show me the “very strong cases”, its spokesperson told me “we don’t publish that information”, then refused to elaborate. Perhaps it’s because the government has told private operators that the information contained in their bids is “<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956117/Freeports_Clarification_QA.pdf\">commercially sensitive</a>”. This is another way in which they’re protected from democracy: they are not subject to the transparency and accountability required of public bodies.</p> <p>The Department for Levelling Up tells me: “It is categorically not the case that the entire area has been earmarked for development or has special planning status.” But if there is one thing we’ve learned in recent years, it’s to attend to what the written policy says, not to what the government says it says. I think I have now read every public official document on freeports in the United Kingdom, and I have found no such assurance. On the contrary, one of them states: “Outside of customs and tax sites, wider Freeport levers, including planning freedoms ... should be targeted within the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956117/Freeports_Clarification_QA.pdf\">Freeport Outer Boundary</a>.”</p> <p>Understandably, all this opacity is beginning to cause alarm. Some people have proposed an even more sinister agenda: the government wants to turn these places into “<a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2022/crypto-libertarian-prospera-lost-legal-battle-honduras/\">charter cities</a>”, corporate fiefs in which environmental and workplace protections are almost entirely stripped away. There is, as yet, no evidence of this. But if any senior politician is biddable and extreme enough to extend the stupidities of freeports, it is Liz Truss. Last month she started promoting the idea of low-tax, low-regulation “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-24/truss-promises-low-tax-uk-investment-zones-in-pitch-to-tory-base\">investment zones</a>”. As usual, she seemed to have little idea what she meant by this: the line was probably fed to her by some unaccountable thinktank. Is it a repackaging of freeports, or something else?</p> <p>In any case, it will deliver nothing but harm. Freeports attract <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/155721/EPRS_STUD_627114_Money%20laundering-FINAL.pdf\">organised crime</a>, money-laundering, drug-trafficking and <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/5407/pdf/\">terrorist finance</a>, while bringing minimal <a href=\"https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/comment/uk-free-ports-gamble\">benefits</a> to the nations that host them. But this was never about improving our lives. On the contrary, it’s about subordinating our needs to those of favoured capital.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 18 August 2022. An earlier version stated that freeports’ business rates relief “deprives local authorities of income”; however, the government says it will fully reimburse local authorities, so the cost will be to the Exchequer, not to local authorities.</p> <ul> <li><p>George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/17/plantwatch-keeping-the-carbon-trapped-in-scotlands-vast-peat-bog","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"Plantwatch: keeping the carbon trapped in Scotland’s vast peat bog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/17/plantwatch-keeping-the-carbon-trapped-in-scotlands-vast-peat-bog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/17/plantwatch-keeping-the-carbon-trapped-in-scotlands-vast-peat-bog","fields":{"headline":"Plantwatch: keeping the carbon trapped in Scotland’s vast peat bog","trailText":"The peatlands of Scotland’s Flow Country store 400m tonnes of carbon but are under threat amid warmer summers ","byline":"Paul Simons","body":"<p>Boglands are precious landscapes, and the vast wilderness of bogs of the Flow Country in northern Scotland is considered the world’s largest area of blanket bog – a rare type of peatland that covers the landscape like a blanket and which forms in a cool, wet climate. </p> <p>The peat is created largely from sphagnum moss and when the plant dies its remains do not fully decompose in the bog’s acid waters, and so the dead moss becomes buried and turned into peat along with its carbon contents.

The famous cicadas of Provence, whose familiar callhas marked summer for millennia, have gone quiet.</p> <p>Experts say it is a result of the heatwave in which temperatures across Europe have broken historical records.</p> <p>“We have observed that the cicadas don’t sing almost ever in the afternoon when the temperature exceeds 36C in the shade. It’s too hot for them,” Serge Zaka an agro-climate specialist, told France 3 television. “Because of the heat, they can no longer regulate their temperature and as a result they no longer sing.”</p> <p>The cicada chirp is produced by tymbals, or thin ribbed membranes, in the male’s abdomen, and is designed to attract females. </p> <p>Specialists have said that if the increase in summer temperatures is permanent, the Provençal cicadas could move on elsewhere.</p> <p>“With climate change, it’s very likely that we will see the area inhabited by the species evolve. Cicadas will move up the Rhône Valley farther north and seek altitude in the Pyrenees and southern Alps and the Cévennes,” Zapa said.</p> <p>As well as affecting the male cicada’s ability to sing, extreme heatwaves may reduce the number of eggs and larvae produced by females, leading to a steep decline in the insect’s population.</p> <p>The <em>cigale – </em>cicada – is a symbol of Provence and has featured in literature for centuries. The Greeks, for whom they represented death and rebirth, wrote poems to them. According to Provençal folklore, the cicada was sent by God to rouse working locals from their afternoon siestas to stop them being too indolent. The fable written by Jean de la Fontaine of the cicada and the ant has the former singing all summer while the latter works accumulating a store of food to survive winter.</p> <p>There are an estimated 2,500 cicada species around the world; those in Provence live for four years, most of which is spent underground. It is one of the world’s noisiest insects, producing chirps of up to 120 decibels. When it rains or the temperature falls below 22C, the cicada’s diaphragm loses its elasticity and it shuts up.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/17/high-heat-review-here-for-gratuitously-naked-firefighters-youll-enjoy-this-soapy-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"High Heat review – here for gratuitously naked firefighters?

Shame about the implausible plot, and borderline comic tone<br>","byline":"Jack Seale","body":"<p>Latin America still feels like an untapped resource for Netflix, at least in terms of global crossover hits. It has given the world shows made in France, Germany, South Korea and even Canada, but its roster of Central and South American dramas remains low on must-sees. Sprawling firefighter drama Donde Hubo Fuego – billed in the UK as High Heat – tries hard to change that, and fails.</p> <p>Poncho (Iván Amozurrutia) is minding his own business, thrilling female punters by performing on stage in a Mexico City strip club, when his more serious-minded journalist brother is murdered. Could the killing be related to their shared past, growing up as orphans in foster care? What’s the connection to a famous serial-killer case? His brother was investigating a particular fire station in the capital before he died, so Poncho swaps one impressive hose for another – giving up erotic dancing and training as a firefighter, the better to continue the hunt for clues. When the station chief is killed by a car bomb and replaced by a mystery man from out of town, how long will it take Poncho to figure out that the new boss (Eduardo Capetillo) is, in fact, his father?</p> <p>High Heat is somewhere between a regular miniseries and a soapy, endlessly regenerating telenovela, since it doesn’t go on for ever but, at 39 half-hour episodes, is not far off. Underneath the main storyline are subplots featuring alcoholism, self-harm, cancer and a supposedly straight man hiding his real sexuality – which, ludicrously, manifests via a covert interest in knitting.</p> <p>One of the telenovela’s most familiar acting tropes is heavily in evidence, namely the grumpy, smouldering stare. Characters eyeball each other for several seconds at the conclusion of a scene, after a dark secret or ruthless betrayal has been unearthed. There is secret, one-way staring, where a character’s rival eavesdrops unseen in the background, staring at them from behind. There is solo staring, on a sofa or in a car, often accompanied by echoey repeats of dialogue from important previous scenes to remind us who this person is and what’s troubling them. Here and there, High Heat is happy to use the reverbed-flashback trick to convey information that we haven’t previously been privy to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b41e067d2bcc0d4727bb533647f1eb05a7508971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b41e067d2bcc0d4727bb533647f1eb05a7508971/65_15_1973_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esmeralda Pimentel as Olivia in High Heat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esmeralda Pimentel as Olivia in High Heat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NETFLIX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are hints that writer/creator José Ignacio Valenzuela is not taking events quite as seriously as his characters. “What am I doing here?” says Poncho at the end of a scene where he inexplicably wanders away from brightly lit safety and on to a spookily deserted hotel roof. “There are no coincidences,” he is told soon after, by a supporting character who has met him thanks to what appears to be a colossal coincidence. Very occasionally, High Heat goes fully meta: “It’s a thrilling story,” says an investigative journalist, asked about her obsession with the same mystery we are following. “It has all the ingredients: psychopathy, sexual drives, police corruption, border issues. It looks like a Netflix series.”</p> <p>Sadly, these are rare flashes of the knowing chaos High Heat could have unleashed. Its tone is close to comedic but it refuses to lean into that by giving anyone a regular stock of funny lines, despite having a prime candidate in the eccentric boarding-house proprietress whose accommodation is across the street from the station, and whose daughters are all dating or perving over the firefighters. Nor does High Heat fully embrace the camp of soap by unloading one outrageous twist after another with a fierce, straight face – the revelations are implausibly convenient, for sure, but never delightfully, screamingly ridiculous. And if you tune in to enjoy hunky firefighters flexing their buttocks in gratuitous communal shower scenes before heading home for hot sex with their ladyfolk … well, you won’t be left completely hanging, but neither will you be brought above a mild simmer. Even the station’s sexually voracious pencil-skirted in-house psychologist (Ana Jimena Villanueva) doesn’t generate all that much mischievous spice.</p> <p>Mostly, High Heat is just a bit sloppy. Poncho’s habit of suddenly remembering to follow up on a clue he’s had in his possession for ages quickly becomes annoying, and sometimes it feels as if there are simply bits of the narrative missing. The best performance comes from Esmeralda Pimentel as Olivia, Poncho’s girlfriend – and the station’s only female firefighter. But Pimentel’s attempt to render a steel-willed, assertive beacon of common sense is undermined by the character’s lack of backstory: the show’s central romance arrives from nowhere and continues without giving Olivia much of a stake or say in it. That love story, like everything else in High Heat, is lukewarm.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/17/stop-drinking-keep-reading-look-after-your-hearing-a-neurologists-tips-for-fighting-memory-loss-and-alzheimers","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Stop drinking, keep reading, look after your hearing: a neurologist’s tips for fighting memory loss and Alzheimer’s","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/17/stop-drinking-keep-reading-look-after-your-hearing-a-neurologists-tips-for-fighting-memory-loss-and-alzheimers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/17/stop-drinking-keep-reading-look-after-your-hearing-a-neurologists-tips-for-fighting-memory-loss-and-alzheimers","fields":{"headline":"Stop drinking, keep reading, look after your hearing: a neurologist’s tips for fighting memory loss and Alzheimer’s","trailText":"When does forgetfulness become something more serious? And how can we delay or even prevent that change? We talk to brain expert Richard Restak","byline":"Gaby Hinsliff","body":"<p>You walk into a room, but can’t remember what you came in for. Or you bump into an old acquaintance at work, and forget their name. Most of us have had momentary memory lapses like this, but in middle age they can start to feel more ominous. Do they make us look unprofessional, or past it? Could this even be a sign of impending dementia? The good news for the increasingly forgetful, however, is that not only can memory be improved with practice, but that it looks increasingly as if some cases of Alzheimer’s may be preventable too.</p> <p>Neuroscientist Dr Richard Restak is a past president of the American Neuropsychiatric Association, who has lectured on the brain and behaviour everywhere from the Pentagon to Nasa, and written more than 20 books on the human brain. His latest, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-complete-guide-to-memory-9781510770270\">The Complete Guide to Memory: The Science of Strengthening Your Mind</a>, homes in on the great unspoken fear that every time you can’t remember where you put your reading glasses, it’s a sign of impending doom. “In America today,” he writes “anyone over 50 lives in dread of the big A.” Memory lapses are, he writes, the single most common complaint over-55s raise with their doctors, even though much of what they describe turns out to be nothing to worry about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f345cf6c97ce4ad77121b3ff295cf4f35ba0635\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f345cf6c97ce4ad77121b3ff295cf4f35ba0635/0_0_602_900/334.jpg\" alt=\"The Complete Guide to Memory: The Science of Strengthening Your Mind cover\" width=\"334\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Coming out of a shop and not being able to remember where you left the car, for example, is perfectly normal: it’s likely you just weren’t concentrating when you parked, and therefore the car’s location wasn’t properly encoded in your brain. Forgetting what you came into a room for is probably just a sign you’re busy and preoccupied with other things, says Restak.</p> <p>“Samuel Johnson said that the art of memory is the art of attention,” he says, down the line from his office in Washington DC (at 80, Restak is still a practising clinical professor at George Washington Hospital University School of Medicine and Health). “Most of these sins of ‘memory loss’ are sins of not paying attention. If you’re at a party and you’re not really listening to someone, because you are still thinking about some work-related matter, suddenly later you find you can’t remember their name. The first thing is you put the information in memory – that’s consolidating it – and then you have to be able to retrieve it. But if you’ve never consolidated it in the first place, it doesn’t exist.”</p> <p>But what if you forget where you left your car keys, and eventually find them inside the fridge? “That’s often the first sign of something serious – you open up the refrigerator door, and it’s the newspaper, or your car keys, inside. That’s a little bit beyond forgetful.”</p> <p>Memory does vary, he points out, and some people will always have been scatty. But the real red flag is a change that seems out of character. If you’re a keen card player who prides yourself on always keeping track of which cards have been played, and suddenly realise you can’t do that any more, it could be worth investigating. Similarly, Restak has noticed that many patients in the early stages of dementia stop reading fiction, because it’s too difficult to remember what the character said or did a few chapters earlier – which is unfortunate, he says, because reading complex novels can be a valuable mental workout in itself.</p> <p>Restak and his wife are currently on Alexandre Dumas’s The Count of Monte Cristo, which has a complex sprawling cast: “It’s an exercise in being able to keep track of characters without going backwards from one page to another.” If that’s already difficult for you, he says, it’s fine to underline the first mention of a new character and then flip back to remind yourself later if necessary. “Do whatever you have to, to keep yourself reading.”</p> <p>Like following a recipe, keeping track of fictional plots is an exercise of working memory – as distinct from short-term memory (temporarily storing something like a phone number that you can safely forget the minute you’ve dialed it) or episodic memory, which covers things like recollections of childhood. Working memory is what we use to “work with the information we have”, says Restak, and it’s the one we should all prioritise. Left to its own devices, he points out, memory naturally starts to decline from your 30s onwards, which is why he advocates practising it daily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"50d3d72aab50db8e7767806a1243577b9a786776\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50d3d72aab50db8e7767806a1243577b9a786776/0_617_8272_4965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘The way we frame something in our memory is how we then perceive the world around us’ … Richard Restak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The way we frame something in our memory is how we then perceive the world around us’ … Richard Restak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Kahn/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Restak’s book is full of games, tricks and ideas for honing recall, often involving creating vivid visual images for things you want to remember. He holds a mental map of his neighbourhood in his head, incorporating visually familiar landmarks – his house, the local library, a restaurant he often goes to – and for each item on a list he wants to remember, he will create a memorable visual image and attach it somewhere specific on the map. To remember to buy milk, bread and coffee later, for example, he might envisage his house transformed into a carton of milk, the library full of loaves rather than books, and a giant cup of coffee spilling out of the restaurant.</p> <p>The book also touches on broader lifestyle advice. Recently, research from the Lancet’s commission on dementia suggested up to <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/news/2020-07-30/lancet-40-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-targeting-12-risk-factors\">40%</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/news/2020-07-30/lancet-40-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-targeting-12-risk-factors\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/news/2020-07-30/lancet-40-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-targeting-12-risk-factors\">of Alzheimer’s cases could be prevented or delayed</a> – much like heart disease and many cancers – by limiting 12 risk factors, from smoking to obesity and heavy drinking.</p> <p>Restak advises his patients to quit alcohol by 70 at the latest. Over 65, he writes, you typically have fewer brain neurons than when you were younger, so why risk them? “Alcohol is a very, very weak neurotoxin – it’s not good for nerve cells.”</p> <p>He’s also an advocate of the short afternoon nap, since getting enough sleep helps brain function (which may help explain why sleep-deprived new mothers, and menopausal women suffering from night sweats and insomnia, often complain of brain fog).</p> <p>More unexpectedly, he recommends tackling hearing or vision problems promptly, because they make it harder to engage in conversations and hobbies that keep the cogs turning. “You have to have a certain level of vision to read comfortably, and if that’s missing then you are going to read less. As a result of that, you’re going to learn less and be a less interesting person to other people. All of these things really come down to socialisation, which is the most important part of keeping away Alzheimer’s and dementia, and keeping your memory.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Socialisation is the most important part of keeping away Alzheimer’s and dementia, and keeping your memory</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is he saying that honing your memory can stop you getting Alzheimer’s? “No one can guarantee that anybody else is not going to get dementia. Take somebody like Iris Murdoch (the late writer, who suffered from it) – there’s probably not a more brilliant woman in all of Europe, so it shows that it can happen. But I compare it to driving a car: you can’t guarantee you won’t get in an accident but by wearing your seatbelt and checking your speed and keeping the car maintained, you can lessen your chances.”</p> <p>Not all memories, however, are ones people want to treasure. Many have mental images they’d rather forget, whether it’s of an embarrassing mistake or a painful failed relationship, or intrusive flashbacks from post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>The fantasy of wiping the slate clean is a pervasive one in popular culture, from the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (about a couple who break up, and use a futuristic machine to zap memories of each other) to the Men in Black franchise, where alien-fighting secret agents electronically erase the memories of anyone who sees them in action, thus protecting mere mortals from the truth about what’s out there.</p> <p>These may be strictly fantasies but we already have the technology, Restak suggests, to inhibit people from laying down memories that might in future haunt them. Beta blockers, drugs sometimes used to treat high blood pressure, have been found to dull the emotional response triggered when something frightening is recalled, but Restak says there’s evidence they also interfere with the consolidation of events as memories.</p> <p>“There are actually discussions about whether these drugs should be part of the armoury that would be used if we have got to send people into terrible scenarios, such as after a shooting – that must be a horrible experience, to go in there and clean these places up.” But it’s a blunt tool – the drugs can’t distinguish between memories that might be useful in future to emergency first responders, and ones that are simply distressing – and raises complex questions about the ethics of tampering with people’s minds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Don’t just look on dementia as a hopeless situation, although it’s a very frustrating one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Restak also highlights concerns about what he calls “memory wars”, or attempts to influence a nation’s collective memory by disputing what a particular event or period means. “The way we frame it in our memory is how we then perceive the world around us, and that’s what is encoded in the memory,” he says, pointing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/is-us-in-a-recession\">recent political arguments in the US</a> over whether the technical recession the country has entered – defined as two quarters of economic contraction – is actually a “real” recession. “It’s important because if you think you are in a recession you have certain beliefs and modes of action, and that’s how we are going to remember July 2022.”</p> <p>And, as he argues, memory is intrinsic to who we are. It binds families and couples together, as we reminisce about our shared past. For individuals, meanwhile, past experience gives life meaning and texture. “We are what we can remember. The more things you can remember, the more clearly, the more full and enriched our personalities,” says Restak, who argues that the personalities of dementia sufferers can become flatter and more attenuated. “People say ‘Oh, they don’t seem to be the same person.’” Perhaps that’s why we fear Alzheimer’s so much: memory is so closely allied to a sense of self.</p> <p>Yet even after memory loss has set in, it’s not necessarily too late to help people hold on to whatever’s left. One neurologist Restak knows had two patients who “weren’t sure where they were or what day it was”, but could still play a decent game of bridge. If someone you love has Alzheimer’s, Restak says, don’t upset them by constantly challenging mistakes or memory lapses; instead, meet them where they are now.</p> <p>“What are they still interested in? Talk about that, work with that, because a lot of things stay within normal range even with a pattern of dementia,” he says. “You don’t just look on it as a hopeless situation, although it’s a very frustrating one and it’s very sad.” Where a flicker of memory remains, perhaps, there’s hope.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/17/country-diary-a-heady-mix-of-sex-and-drugs-for-this-wasp","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T04:30:05Z","webTitle":"Country diary: A heady mix of sex and drugs for this wasp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/country-diary-a-heady-mix-of-sex-and-drugs-for-this-wasp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/17/country-diary-a-heady-mix-of-sex-and-drugs-for-this-wasp","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: A heady mix of sex and drugs for this wasp","trailText":"<strong>Deerness Valley Way, County Durham:</strong> We watched the whole performance – a bewildered, stumbling wasp, unable to resist another floral visit","byline":"Phil Gates","body":"<p>It has begun to feel autumnal here.

This disused railway line, linking former pit villages, is all edges. It skirts woods and old quarries, sheep pastures and meadows where curlews nest, snaking downhill from Stanley Crook towards Esh Winning.</p> <p>A century ago, the valley would have been filled with the sounds of colliery hooters, squealing pulleys and iron wheels on rail tracks. The gradient was too steep for locomotives, so coal wagons were hauled on cables, up the fearsome Stanley Incline to the stationary engine on the hilltop. Today it was quiet, just the leaves rustling in the trees.</p> <p>We had almost reached Waterhouses when we found the first helleborines, in dappled shade among brambles.

The head of a wasp is just the right size and shape to pick up a pollinium when it forces its way in, reaching for nectar.</p> <p>We watched the whole performance: a bewildered, stumbling wasp, unsuccessfully trying to remove its pollinium burden, but unable to resist the lure of another floral visit. It had been drugged by the plant’s nectar. Some research suggests that it contains fermented alcohol that stupefies visitors; other evidence indicates that it’s laced with opiates.</p> <p>I gave the wasp a cautious poke, wary of an aggressive response.

Completely removing invasive species from islands has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/10/driving-out-invasive-species-on-islands-high-success-rate-big-benefits-aoe\">proven to be one of the most effective tools</a> at halting and reversing this damage, the study found.</p> <p>Last month, New Zealand conservationists announced they would attempt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/07/new-zealand-to-embark-on-worlds-largest-feral-predator-eradication\">the biggest ever eradication of invasive species on an inhabited island</a>. The project aims to remove predators including possums, rats, feral cats and hedgehogs from Rakiura/Stewart Island – the country’s third largest Island – over the next four years.</p> <p>But Russell said it was heartening that efforts were also being helped by people setting traps in their own backyards. “Now the database shows that everyone doing things in their backyard makes a huge difference internationally,” he said.</p> <p>The country’s conservation technology and expertise has become something of an export industry for New Zealand, Russell said, and that was something to be proud of. “We don’t make a lot of money exporting it, but we do make the world a better place.”</p> <p>The research may have given New Zealand’s pest control efforts a gold star, but it also showed that its eradication efforts were slowing down. This is partly due to conservationists making headway on the smaller islands and leaving the islands with a larger land mass til last – meaning control efforts take longer to produce results.</p> <p>But that does not mean the country can become complacent, Russell said.</p> <p>“It’s not enough to just let nature be tucked away in some corner and feel good that we’ve created a few islands.

Forests are our best line of defence against climate change, and should be at the top of our list [of priorities].”</p> <p>He said the carbon released to the atmosphere by forest fires was creating a vicious circle of climate damage. “These forests can go from being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/tropical-forests-losing-their-ability-to-absorb-carbon-study-finds\">carbon sinks to being sources of carbon</a> in the atmosphere,” he said.</p> <p>The common image of forest fires is in temperate regions, for instance in Europe and the US where fires have been increasing as hot dry summer weather has become more prevalent, and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/01/brazil-amazon-rainforest-worst-fires-in-decade\">Brazil where fires started for deforestation have caused widespread devastation through the Amazon</a>.</p> <p>But boreal forest has been warming rapidly and drying out, making it more prone to catch fire. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/02/climate-crisis-siberian-heatwave-led-to-new-methane-emissions-study-says\">Heatwaves have struck northern Canada and Siberia in recent years</a>, and the Arctic has warmed much faster than the rest of the planet.</p> <p>About a third to 40% of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/10/is-this-the-end-of-forests-as-weve-known-them\"> boreal forest fires</a> are thought to start naturally by lightning strikes, but the other leading source of fires starting is people.

As for them, they’re here 24/7.”</p> <p>The “them” in this case is a shifting platoon of police, some equipped with shields and teargas, others in full battle dress and yet others in uniforms of simple blue. Papageorgiou is among the protesters who in energy-sapping temperatures have been meeting daily and chanting themselves hoarse at the lower end of the square.</p> <p>The face-off started last week when the heavily armed units were ordered to stand guard outside hastily erected metal barricades topped with chainlink fencing that overnight turned the once-vibrant square into a no-go zone.</p> <p>“They want to build a metro station and so they come at 4.30 in the morning in a month when most are on holiday to do it,” she sighs, shaking her head in disbelief. “When my son saw all the metal sheets he burst into tears.

Gritty and graffiti-strewn, the district lies metres away from the avenue housing Athens Polytechnic, the site of the uprising against the 1967-74 Colonels’ regime, an event that would lead to the deaths of dozens of students but is now credited with extinguishing military rule.</p> <p>In a neighbourhood also known for its densely populated narrow streets, protesters say the square is that rare thing: a green space that, if also synonymous with drugs and criminality, offers the opportunity for young and old to mix. “Yes, it had its problems, but it was a breathing space that was very important for those who live here,” says Nikos Papakostas, adding that the plaza’s playground was a lifeline for his two young children.</p> <p>“If the metro is built it will transform the square into a concrete space of air shafts, elevators and stairs. It is a completely irrational plan that is not about city planning but politics,” Papakostas says.</p> <p>Few public works have been the source of such rancour in the Greek capital in recent years. Writing in the country’s leading conservative daily, Kathimerini, on Friday, one columnist likened the dispute to the battle put up by Native Americans against the railroads in the 1860s. “Their culture couldn’t survive the advance of civilisation that the railroad brought,” opined Takis Theodoropoulos in a piece underlining the inflammatory rhetoric now surrounding the issue. “And that is what worries the natives of Exarchia most.”</p> <p>The centre-right government has made the cleanup of the district, long seen by conservatives as a den of lawlessness, a priority. In an effort to restore a sense of public security to a neighbourhood whose anti-authoritarian culture has earned it a reputation for being a state within a state, the administration of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/greece-scraps-law-banning-police-from-university-campuses\">scrapped</a> a law banning police from entering university campuses within weeks of assuming office in 2019.</p> <p>For opponents, the metro line is the last stop in a gentrification scheme aimed squarely at altering the historically leftwing area. “A public work is being used for ideological reasons,” says Papakostas, bemoaning the prospect of Exarchia being overwhelmed by tourists once the station opens in a decade’s time. “And they are using public funds to police the area around the clock. It’s insane.”</p> <p>But in a sign of the battle’s intensity, there are also many within Exarchia who disagree with that view.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74b8d609648cb2b0ed963562767bf2a4b2cd0a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74b8d609648cb2b0ed963562767bf2a4b2cd0a6e/377_0_3472_2084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nikos Papakostas, one of Exarchia’s residents protesting against the new station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nikos Papakostas, one of Exarchia’s residents protesting against the new station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helena Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Giorgos Apostolopoulos, a city councillor with the centre-left Pasok party who was born and bred in the district, the metro is long overdue. “The vast majority are in favour of the metro and have been rooting for it since the 1980s,” he says, listing the benefits of a mode of transport that will not only reduce traffic congestion but help the area economically.</p> <p>“It’s a sad fact that in most squares with metro stations, trees have had to be uprooted, but, as in the past, they will be replanted,” adds Apostolopoulos, a self-described green who is in charge of Pasok’s environmental policy. “The protesters, I’m afraid, represent a minority view, even if they have a point about rents and neighbourhoods becoming unaffordable when the likes of Airbnb and tourists move in.”</p> <p>It is not lost on opponents that the new line was approved in 2018 by a leftwing government keen to sign off on a major infrastructure work that would leave its mark on the capital.</p> <p>“It was then that the impact of Exarchia’s station with all its failings on the square became apparent,” recalls Nikos Belavilas, a professor of urban planning at the National Technical University of Athens. “Metro plans have been changed in the past in this city and in this case they should be changed again,” says the academic, who headed the state body tasked with overseeing Athens’ regeneration at the time.</p> <p>“It would make much more sense if the station was built a few hundred metres away next to the national archaeological museum,” he says. “The numbers speak for themselves. Hundreds of thousands of visitors would use the station every year, Exarchia’s square would remain intact and this dispute would be solved.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/16/patrick-reed-lawsuit-defamation-brandel-chamblee","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T03:42:06Z","webTitle":"Patrick Reed files $750m defamation suit against Golf Channel pundit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/16/patrick-reed-lawsuit-defamation-brandel-chamblee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/16/patrick-reed-lawsuit-defamation-brandel-chamblee","fields":{"headline":"Patrick Reed files $750m defamation suit against Golf Channel pundit","trailText":"Patrick Reed’s lawsuit alleges that Golf Channel’s Brandel Chamblee has conspired with the PGA Tour and commissioner Jay Monahan to defame him","byline":"Guardian sport and agencies","body":"<p>Patrick Reed is the latest member of the LIV Golf Series to turn from the course to the courts, as the 2018 Masters champion has filed a $750m defamation lawsuit against Golf Channel and commentator Brandel Chamblee.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/16/tiger-woods-to-meet-with-top-golfers-to-stem-defections-to-liv-series\">Tiger Woods to meet with top golfers to stem defections to LIV Series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The civil suit, a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22138146-patrick_reed_golf_channel\">copy</a> of which has been obtained by the Guardian, was filed on Tuesday in a Texas court.

I can’t believe I just played Serena Williams,” said Raducanu afterwards.</p> \n<p>After an unwelcome one-day delay, Williams and Raducanu finally arrived on Tuesday evening with tightly packed crowds lining the grounds and peeking out from the overlooking stadium court to catch a glimpse of the American great before her match. When Williams arrived in the stadium, the audience offered her a standing ovation.</p> \n<p>This was a battle of distant generations with 21 years separating 40-year-old Williams from 19-year-old Raducanu. But after a career characterised by countless comebacks, Williams’ one-year absence from the tour after last year’s Wimbledon has so far proved too long for her to regain her best form.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d1b2813efb48ef43810d46fc2008fa9f1d67c93\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d1b2813efb48ef43810d46fc2008fa9f1d67c93/0_0_4700_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Raducanu applauds Serena Williams off the court at Lindner Family Tennis Center.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Raducanu applauds Serena Williams off the court at Lindner Family Tennis Center.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Williams opened the match with a horrendous opening service game, striking four errors in a row and losing the first five points of the match as she immediately fell down a break. It set the tone for a dire performance until the end as she once again struggled desperately to establish any timing on her groundstrokes and her significantly diminished movement meant she was a sitting duck whenever Raducanu took control.</p> \n<p>After a year of constant attention following her US Open victory, for Raducanu this was a rare opportunity as, for once, all cameras and eyes were focused on her opponent across the net.</p> \n<p>Without expectations or inhibitions, Raducanu played a faultless match. She soaked up Williams’ first strikes, patiently tested her opponent’s shot tolerance in extended rallies and whenever the ball dropped short, attacked without hesitation, exposing Williams’ greatly diminished movement. She ended the match with just a single unforced error along with 14 winners.</p> \n<p>“[This] may be one of the last opportunities I get to play her,” she said. “You have to cherish the moment, and you’re going to have this memory for the rest of your career. I was just really trying to make the most out of every single point out there and give myself the best memories of when I played Serena once.”</p> \n<p>Despite her glee, Raducanu reacted to her victory with an extremely understated celebration, barely even clenching a fist as Williams’ forehand flew long. “To be honest, I was just in awe. I think I said one ‘come on’ in the match, and I was just saying to myself, because I respect her so much as an athlete, as a tennis player, as a person,” she said.</p> \n<p>In Toronto last week, a day after Williams announced that the countdown to the end of her career had begun, she was defeated in straight sets by Belinda Bencic. After the loss, she remained for a rare loser’s on-court interview and barely held back tears as she said goodbye to Canada.</p> \n<p>This time, despite the organisers lining up champagne by the court, there was no ceremony or silver lining. Williams packed her bags and left in a flash, her frustration clear for all to see. She did not attend her post-match press conference afterwards.</p> \n<p>Only one tournament of Williams’ career remains, and this is far from how she envisioned the end. She will now head to the US Open, and for the madness that awaits her there in her final event, having won just one match in her three singles tournaments back.</p> \n<p>“I think we all need to just honour Serena and her amazing career,” said Raducanu. “I’m so grateful for this experience to play her and for our careers to have crossed over. Everything she achieved is inspirational and it was a true honour to share the court with her.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83e7d4ab33da149deeb6ed96d0620c17735ff312\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83e7d4ab33da149deeb6ed96d0620c17735ff312/0_90_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serena Williams waves to the crowd after her first-round defeat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serena Williams waves to the crowd after her first-round defeat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Buell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Raducanu, an unlikely opportunity to face a player who was a hall of famer before she even existed ended like a dream.

The waning water levels, which have left dramatic bathtub rings in reservoirs and unearthed buried bodies and other artifacts, continue to threaten hydroelectric power production, drinking water, and agricultural production.</p> <p>“The system is approaching a tipping point,” the Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, M Camille Calimlim Touton, said during a news conference on Tuesday, adding that urgent action was required. “Protecting the system means protecting the people of the American west.”</p> <p>The new cuts will reduce Arizona’s water share by 21%, Nevada’s by 8% and Mexico’s by 7%, but officials are concerned more reductions will be needed. The cuts will place officials in those states under extraordinary pressure to plan for a hotter, drier future and a growing population. </p> <p>The Colorado River provides water to 40 million people across seven states in the American west as well as Mexico and helps feed an agricultural industry valued at $15bn a year.

But the most contentious period is likely to lie ahead. The climate crisis is expected to continue to intensify conditions, prompting the need for deeper cuts and conservation.</p> <p>Cities and farms across the region are already anxiously awaiting official hydrology projections – estimates of future water levels in the river – that will determine the extent and scope of cuts to their water supply. Hundreds of thousands of acres of US farmland is expected to be left fallow across the country’s breadbasket, putting a crunch on food produced domestically.</p> <p>“The states collectively have not identified and adopted specific actions of sufficient magnitude that would stabilize the system,” Touton said.</p> <p>Touton has said the additional reduction is necessary to ensure that water deliveries and hydroelectric power are not disrupted. She was noncommittal on Tuesday about whether she planned to impose those cuts unilaterally if the states could not reach agreement.</p> <p>She emphasized partnership between federal officials and their counterparts in the seven states and Mexico but repeatedly declined to say how much time the states would have to reach the deal she requested in June.</p> <p>For years, cities and farms have diverted more water from the river than flows through it, depleting its reservoirs.</p> <p>After more than two decades of drought, Arizona, Nevada and Mexico were hit with mandatory cuts for the first time last year.

In June, officials said the states must figure out how to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/drought-stricken-western-states-face-deadline-to-cut-water-use-from-colorado-river\">use 15% less water next year</a> or have cuts imposed on them.</p> <p>The predicament has <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-08-15/tensions-grow-in-colorado-river-negotiations\">prompted tensions</a> between states with different priorities for the water they receive, and talks have failed to yield any agreement.</p> <p>“There are a lot of different interests at loggerheads. And there’s a lot to overcome, and there’s a lot of animosity,” said Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-08-15/tensions-grow-in-colorado-river-negotiations\">told the Los Angeles Times</a>.</p> <p>The bureau must now figure the next steps the reclamation bureau commissioner, Camille Touton, can take after the mid-August deadline has passed for the seven Colorado river states to reduce water use by 25%.</p> <p>Some experts say further cuts will be inevitable, which could affect states further along the basin, including California.</p> <p>Together, dire hydrology projections and the deadline for cuts are presenting the western states with unprecedented challenges and confronting them with difficult decisions about how to plan for a drier future.</p> <p>Some experts see today’s action as only a short-term fix.

It said: “It is difficult to ask people who have experienced painful loss and have waited so long to wait for longer, but please try to keep in mind that this recommendation is not the end of the inquiry’s work, and the question of compensation has not been resolved in the inquiry’s report on interim payments.”</p> <p>Des Collins, a senior partner at Collins Solicitors, which represents 1,500 of the victims, said: “We will continue to lobby government until all those entitled are fully compensated for the loved ones they have lost.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/10/pay-contaminated-blood-scandal-victims-before-they-die-boris-johnson-urged\">Pay infected blood scandal victims before they die, Boris Johnson urged</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: “We look forward to clarification from the government in the coming days as to how and when the payments will be processed and, more generally, whether the remainder of Sir Robert Francis QC’s recommendations are to be accepted and full compensation paid to all who are entitled including the bereaved and the estates of the deceased.”</p> <p>Survivors welcomed the cash as the first recognition of culpability by the government, but called for the scheme to be widened.</p> <p>Richard Warwick, 57, from Scarborough was infected with HIV and hepatitis C in contaminated treatments given to him as a pupil at Treloar college, a school that specialised in caring for haemophiliacs.

It proved to be a lifesaving appointment.","byline":"","body":"<p>There’s one afternoon at work that optometrist Virginia Carlton will always remember.</p> <p>One of her regular patients, Robyn McCaskill, had come in for the last appointment of the day seeking eye drops. After months of pandemic-enforced mask wearing, Robyn was reporting that her eyes had become dry and irritated as her breath fogged up her glasses.</p> <p>“We discussed the problems Robyn was experiencing and then proceeded to do her full checkup,” Carlton says. “In an eye test we always take the history first, check the vision and then we go onto the ocular health. And pretty much as soon as I had a look behind the eye, I realised what was there.”</p> <p>Robyn had a melanoma behind her left eye that was causing the retina to detach. It was a serious situation that required urgent medical attention.</p> <p>“It’s that hard scenario where Robyn’s come in thinking eye drops are going to fix her problem,” Carlton says. “Telling someone they need to go to emergency straight away is quite a shocking thing for anyone to go through. I still remember the shock on Robyn’s face, then as I was explaining what was happening to her daughter, Robyn just couldn’t believe what she was hearing.”</p> <p>For Robyn, that appointment was the start of a very difficult period – but she is very thankful she caught the cancer when she did.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Having that eye test saved my life completely. Without it, I wouldn’t have known that there was a melanoma in my body at all.”</p> <footer> <cite>says Robyn McCaskill</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After her eye check at Specsavers Waurn Ponds in Geelong, Robyn went straight to the emergency department. Carlton had arranged for the ophthalmologist at the local public hospital to stay late that Friday night so that Robyn could be seen straight away. After an upsetting experience getting through triage in the pandemic, Robyn was eventually seen. <br><br>A few days later, multiple test results through the private hospital system revealed the positive news that the cancer hadn’t spread anywhere else in her body. That made Robyn’s next decision easy to make: she would have surgery to remove her eye and the melanoma rather than taking her chances with radiation treatment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638746d847b479205a572d238c5fdcfef27d71f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638746d847b479205a572d238c5fdcfef27d71f3/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Specsavers Article Body Image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Specsavers Article Body Image</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: undefined/Specsavers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Robyn had a melanoma behind her left eye that was picked up at an eye checkup. Now, Robyn is thankful for the second chance at life she received.</p></li> </ul> <p>After three months of recovery, a lot of tears and a large amount of bruising, Robyn was healed from her life-changing surgery and ready to be fitted for a prosthetic eye. Ocularist Patrick Loyer created a prosthetic designed to match Robyn’s right eye perfectly, spending three hours hand-painting the iris to get it just right. (“I’ve never had a man stare so hard into my eye as he hand-painted this iris,” Robyn laughs. “He did such a fantastic job.”) While she can’t see out of the prosthesis, it moves with her right eye and looks so convincing that people assume she has full vision.</p> <p>Today, Robyn is cancer free and full of praise for the medical professionals who helped her through her journey – including optometrist Carlton, who fought for her to get through the public hospital system that night.</p> <p>What really rattles Robyn is that she had always had her eyes checked annually, but had missed her 2020 eye check due to the Victorian lockdowns. There had been no sign of melanoma prior to that fateful day in 2021. And in the five short weeks between her initial appointment at Specsavers and the surgery to remove her eye, the melanoma had already doubled in size. Had Robyn left her eye check any later, the outcome may have been heartbreakingly different.</p> <p>“I really think my prognosis would have been terrible,” Robyn says. ”I would have lost my life by now. It was a very, very aggressive cancer.”</p> <p>For Carlton, stories like Robyn’s underscore the importance of regular eye checks.</p> <p>“A lot of people think an optometrist is just checking your vision to see if you need glasses or not,” Carlton says. “But what we’re actually looking for is eye diseases, a lot of which actually don’t have symptoms. We’re having a look at the retina to make sure there’s no melanomas or diabetes affecting the eye.”</p> <p>While ocular melanomas like Robyn’s are relatively rare (125-150 Australians are diagnosed with this type of cancer each year, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org.au/cancer-information/types-of-cancer/rare-cancers/eye-ocular-melanoma\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cancer Council</a>), Carlton says she normally has a couple of patients a week present with issues such as glaucoma and macular degeneration, most of which are treatable when caught early.</p> <p>Now, at 60, Robyn is thankful for the second chance at life she received.</p> <p>“We’re only here for a moment in time,” she says. “I want to watch my family grow, and grow old with my husband and friends.

secretary, Grant Shapps, proposed a Whitehall review of how cyclists who flout the law can be tracked down by police.</p> <p>“Somewhere where cyclists are actually not breaking the law is when they speed, and that cannot be right, so I absolutely propose extending speed limit restrictions to cyclists,” he said. “Particularly where you’ve got 20mph limits on increasing numbers of roads, cyclists can easily exceed those, so I want to make speed limits apply to cyclists.</p> <p>“That obviously does then lead you into the question of ‘well, how are you going to recognise the cyclist, do you need registration plates and insurance and that sort of thing’. So I’m proposing there should be a review of insurance and how you actually track cyclists who do break the laws [via identifiable markings].”</p> <p>There has been an increase in people using bicycles to get around in recent years and it is understood the government is keen to implement any new rules in 20mph zones in particular.</p> <p>Mandatory insurance for cyclists is also on the table, with Shapps keen to set up a review despite the fact he may no longer be in his role when a new prime minister is elected by Conservative party members on 5 September.</p> <p>He added: “I don’t want to stop people from getting on their bike. It’s a fantastic way to travel, we’ve seen a big explosion of cycling during Covid and since, I think it has lots of health benefits.</p> <p>“But I see no reason why cyclists should break the road laws, why they should speed, why they should bust red lights and be able to get away with it.”</p> <p>If riders injure or kill pedestrians, mandatory insurance would allow the victims or their families to secure compensation in the same way they could make claims if someone was hit by a car or van.</p> <p>It is not the first time in recent weeks the transport secretary has targeted cyclists.

But Christie’s vindication of Gen Z has finite persuasive power. There’s a fine joke about Greta Thunberg, but its point is that her qualities are not typical of her peers.

Experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/05/us-climate-bill-slash-emissions-analysis-biden\">have estimated</a> the bill could reduce US emissions by about 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, close to Biden’s goal of cutting emissions in half by the end of the decade.</p> <p>“This bill is the biggest step forward on climate ever,” Biden said Tuesday. “It’s going to allow us to boldly take additional steps toward meeting all of my climate goals, the ones we set out when we ran.”</p> <p>In terms of healthcare provisions, the bill will allow Medicare to start negotiating the price of certain expensive drugs and will cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for those in the government insurance program for seniors and some with disability status.

I know you.”</p> <p>Biden thanked the South Carolina congressman for endorsing him when he was falling behind in the 2020 primaries.</p> <p>Biden hailed congressional Democrats for passing the bill but also singled out Manchin and gave him the pen with which he signed the bill.</p> <p>After the House passage of the bill last Friday, Democratic party leaders took to the airwaves to tout the benefits of the legislation, promising that it would help ease the financial burden for Americans struggling under the weight of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/10/us-inflation-rate-july-2022\">record-high inflation</a>.</p> <p>“It’s making sure that billionaires in corporate America are paying their fair share, making sure that the tax code is a little bit more fair,” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told ABC News on Sunday. “When you put it in its totality, you will see that it will lower the deficit, which will help fight inflation.”</p> <p>But Republicans have dismissed Democrats’ arguments that the bill will help ease inflation, accusing them of ramming through a reckless spending spree that will do little to aid working Americans.</p> <p>“[Democrats’] response to the runaway inflation they’ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,” the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said earlier this month. “Democrats have proven over and over they simply do not care about middle-class families’ priorities.”</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2022/assessing-the-macroeconomic-consequences-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022.pdf\">a report issued by Moody’s Analytics</a>, Democrats’ spending package will “modestly reduce inflation over the 10-year budget horizon”. But regardless of the bill’s impact, there have been some signs that inflation may be cooling off.</p> <p>US inflation hit an annual rate of 8.5% last month, which represented a slight decrease from the 40-year high of 9.1% recorded in June. If inflation does indeed start to taper off and Democrats can sell the passage of their spending package on the campaign trail, it could help them prevent widespread losses in the midterm elections this November.</p> <p>“I’ve been prepared to win the midterms all along. It depends on getting out the vote. This probably could be helpful,” the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said of the bill’s passage last week. “But I do know it will be helpful to America’s working families, and that’s our purpose.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/16/uk-starts-dispute-proceedings-claiming-exclusion-from-eu-scientific-research","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T21:30:46Z","webTitle":"UK starts dispute proceedings, claiming exclusion from EU scientific research","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/16/uk-starts-dispute-proceedings-claiming-exclusion-from-eu-scientific-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/16/uk-starts-dispute-proceedings-claiming-exclusion-from-eu-scientific-research","fields":{"headline":"UK starts dispute proceedings, claiming exclusion from EU scientific research","trailText":"Liz Truss is seeking ‘formal consultations’ after Horizon programme grants to scientists under Brexit treaty were cancelled","byline":"Rowena Mason Deputy political editor","body":"<p>The UK is triggering dispute proceedings with the EU, accusing it of breaching the Brexit treaty by freezing it out of scientific research programmes following the row over Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership frontrunner, said there had been a “clear breach” of the trade and cooperation agreement, with her department writing to Brussels requesting formal dispute talks.</p> <p>The UK government claimed the EU was causing serious damage to research and development in both the UK and EU member states, with Britain frozen out of science research programme Horizon, Copernicus, the Earth observation programme, which provides data on climate change, Euratom, the nuclear research programme, and space surveillance and tracking.</p> <p>“The EU is in clear breach of our agreement, repeatedly seeking to politicise vital scientific cooperation by refusing to finalise access to these important programmes,” she said. “We cannot allow this to continue.

She seemed to support the case of Loujain al-Hathloul, a prominent Saudi feminist activist who was previously imprisoned, is alleged to have been tortured for supporting driving rights for women, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/saudi-court-upholds-sentence-of-womens-rights-activist-loujain-al-hathloul\">and is now living under a travel ban.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/11/twitter-account-saudi-government-spying\">Twitter allows MBS aide implicated in spying plot to keep verified account</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One person who knew Shehab said she could not stomach injustice. She was described as well-educated and an avid reader who had arrived in the UK in 2018 or 2019 to pursue her PhD at Leeds. She had returned home to Saudi Arabia in December 2020 on a holiday and had intended to bring her two children and husband back to the UK with her. She was then called in for questioning by Saudi authorities and eventually arrested and tried for her tweets.</p> <p>A person who followed her case said Shehab had at times been held in solitary confinement and had sought during her trial to privately tell the judge something about how she had been handled, which she did not want to state in front of her father. She was not permitted to communicate the message to the judge, the person said. The appeals verdict was signed by three judges but the signatures were illegible.</p> <p>Twitter declined to comment on the case and did not respond to specific questions about what – if any – influence Saudi Arabia has over the company. Twitter previously did not respond to questions by the Guardian about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/11/twitter-account-saudi-government-spying\">why a senior aide to Prince Mohammed, Bader al-Asaker</a>, has been allowed to keep a verified Twitter account with more than 2 million followers, despite US government allegations that he orchestrated an illegal infiltration of the company which led anonymous Twitter users to be identified and jailed by the Saudi government. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/09/twitter-saudi-arabia-dissident-spying\">One former Twitter employee has been convicted by a US court</a> in connection to the case.</p> <p>One of Twitter’s biggest investors is the Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who owns more than 5% of Twitter through his investment company, Kingdom Holdings. While Prince Alwaleed still serves as chairman of the company, his control over the group faced questions in the US media, including the Wall Street Journal, after it emerged that the Saudi royal – a cousin of the crown prince – had been held captive at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/19/saudi-accounts-emerge-of-ritz-carlton-night-of-the-beating\">Ritz Carlton in Riyadh for 83 days</a>. The incident was part of a broader purge led by Prince Mohammed against other members of the royal family and businessmen, and involved allegations of torture, coercion and expropriation of billions in assets into Saudi coffers.</p> <p>In a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-20/alwaleed-reveals-secret-deal-struck-to-exit-ritz-after-83-days\">Bloomberg interview of Prince Alwaleed</a>, which was conducted in Riyadh seven weeks after his release, the billionaire acknowledged he had reached a “confirmed understanding” with the Saudi government, apparently in connection to his release, which was confidential.</p> <p>More recently, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/saudi-arabias-alwaleed-sell-1687-kingdom-holding-pif-15-bln-2022-05-22/\">Kingdom Holding announced in May that it had sold about 17% of its company to the PIF</a>, where Prince Mohammed serves as chairman, for $1.5bn. That, in turn, makes the Saudi government a significant indirect investor in Twitter. According to Twitter, investors do not play a role in managing the company’s day-to-day business.</p> <p>The European Saudi Organization for Human Rights condemned Shehab’s sentence, which it said was the longest prison sentence to ever be brought against any activist. It noted that many female activists have been subjected to unfair trials that have led to arbitrary sentences and have been subjected to “severe torture”, including sexual harassment.</p> <p>Khalid Aljabri, a Saudi who is living in exile and whose sister and brother are being held in the kingdom, said the Shehab case proved Saudi Arabia’s view that dissent equates to terrorism.</p> <p>“Salma’s draconian sentencing in a terrorism court over peaceful tweets is the latest manifestation of MBS’s ruthless repression machine,” he said, referring to the crown prince. “Just like [journalist Jamal] Khashoggi’s assassination, her sentencing is intended to send shock waves inside and outside the kingdom – dare to criticise MBS and you will end up dismembered or in Saudi dungeons.”</p> <p>While the case has not received widespread attention, the Washington Post on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/16/salma-al-shehab-prison-sentence-saudi-arabia/\">published a scathing editorial</a> about Saudi Arabia’s treatment of the Leeds student and said her case showed that “commitments” the president had received on reforms were “a farce”.</p> <p>“At the very least, Mr. Biden must now speak out forcefully and demand that Ms. Shehab be released and allowed to return to her sons, 4 and 6 years old, in the United Kingdom, and to resume her studies there,” it read.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Robyn Vinter in Leeds</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/16/rangers-psv-eindhoven-champions-league-qualifying-first-leg-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T21:04:34Z","webTitle":"Rangers have to settle for draw with PSV Eindhoven after Obispo’s late header","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/rangers-psv-eindhoven-champions-league-qualifying-first-leg-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/16/rangers-psv-eindhoven-champions-league-qualifying-first-leg-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Rangers have to settle for draw with PSV Eindhoven after Obispo’s late header","trailText":"Rangers fought back from a goal down via Antonio Colak and Tom Lawrence strikes but Armando Obispo gave PSV a 2-2 draw in this Champions League playoff first leg","byline":"John Brewin","body":"<p>Whether Rangers will make a long-awaited return to the Champions League, or drop into the familiar surroundings of the Europa League, still hangs in the balance.</p> <p>Against PSV, Rangers rode their luck, a goalkeeping disaster by Walter Benítez from Tom Lawrence’s free-kick gifting them their second goal, though there were flashes of the chaotic momentum that carried them to last season’s Europa League final. Next Wednesday in Eindhoven will be a familiar test of nerve.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/besiktas-want-to-take-struggling-dele-alli-from-everton\">Besiktas prepare to offer Dele Alli way out after Everton struggles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>PSV, just as dangerous on the attack and vulnerable in defence as Rangers – though more comfortable in possession – deservedly shared the spoils of an even contest. Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s great friend and former Dutch international teammate, Ruud van Nistelrooy, was in his sixth match as PSV coach and the former striker supreme retained his unbeaten record, though admitting some relief.</p> <p>“In the first half, Rangers were the better team,” he said. “Their fans were behind them and we had to go through a difficult time.” Van Bronckhorst returned the compliment, saying: “PSV is an excellent team, they showed that today.”</p> <p>Rangers’ absence from the Champions League group stage stretches back 12 years, when the club were managed by the late, great Walter Smith. His close friend Sir Alex Ferguson, whose Manchester United team faced Rangers that season, was watching from the Ibrox stands. As Rangers attempted to return to the promised land, another remnant from that time, Steven Davis, now 37, marshalled the midfield.</p> <p>Van Bronckhorst’s reluctance to pair new signing Antonio Colak with Alfredo Morelos continued, a decision vindicated by the Croatia forward’s excellent finish for Rangers’ equaliser. “There’s a big hope for the second game,” said Colak, who ran himself into the ground in working the channels. “We know what we can do. We have a big chance to go into the group stage.”</p> <p>The Rangers manager praised Colak’s work rate without the ball, pointedly saying he had never considered bringing Morelos on. “He scored a great goal,” said Van Bronckhorst. “He gave the energy the team needed.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"372a0f5c9d4c6648af8f07927867437a0e93934d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/372a0f5c9d4c6648af8f07927867437a0e93934d/0_167_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Colak after scoring Rangers’ first-half equaliser\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Colak justified his selection with Rangers’ first-half equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a surface given zip by Glaswegian summer rain, it was Luuk de Jong, PSV’s veteran striker, who had the first chance, making a mess of his finish from Ismael Saibari’s pearler of a pass. But Rangers soon took up their cudgels. Davis’s pass set up Malik Tillman to go close, and a penalty appeal, checked by the VAR, was denied despite the ball appearing to hit the PSV defender Jordan Teze’s hand.</p> <p>The visitors retained their threat on the counter, danger man Cody Gakpo their out-ball on the left keeping James Tavernier from making his trademark runs forward, though it was from a set piece that the Dutch club’s 38th-minute goal came. Connor Goldson failed to clear a corner, then blocked the sightline of his goalkeeper, Jon McLaughlin, as Ibrahim Sangaré’s scuffed shot bobbled in.</p> <p>Rangers’ reaction was incisive; they were level within three minutes. Davis sent away Tavernier on the overlap and Colak’s was a guided finish, “one-touch” in his own words, a fourth goal in four matches.</p> <p>After the break, Rangers’ approach became more direct through necessity as a rejigged PSV dominated possession. “The second half, we really started to play and press and get the ball and play,” said Van Nistelrooy.</p> <p>Yet it was Rangers who struck next, Saibari’s foul on Tillman giving Lawrence a free-kick chance. His effort bounced and skidded off the surface but was more than saveable for Benítez, who spilled the ball and allowed it to bounce over the line to glee from the home fans. “An unfortunate moment for our goalkeeper,” said Van Nistelrooy. “He’s disappointed with that mistake but it’s no problem as it happens.”</p> <p>PSV’s own determination remained admirably undimmed. From another corner, a poorly marked Armando Obispo climbed high to powerfully head their equaliser. To end their Champions League exile, Rangers will have to defend set pieces far better than that, while channelling the spirit of last season’s adventure.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/16/jacobs-and-luckenkemper-take-sprint-golds-as-asher-smith-pulls-up-in-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T21:04:20Z","webTitle":"Lückenkemper and Jacobs take 100m golds as Asher-Smith pulls up in final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/16/jacobs-and-luckenkemper-take-sprint-golds-as-asher-smith-pulls-up-in-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/16/jacobs-and-luckenkemper-take-sprint-golds-as-asher-smith-pulls-up-in-final","fields":{"headline":"Lückenkemper and Jacobs take 100m golds as Asher-Smith pulls up in final","trailText":"Dina Asher-Smith’s hopes of defending her 100m title at the European Athletics Championships ended in pain and disappointment as she pulled up with cramp halfway through a dramatic final","byline":"Sean Ingle in Munich","body":"<p>It was supposed to be a shootout for the ages, with the two fastest female British sprinters in history going toe-to-toe with pride, bragging rights, and a European 100m gold medal on the line. But on a wild and intoxicating night in Munich, Dina Asher-Smith pulled up with cramp and then her compatriot Daryll Neita blamed the same problem for robbing her of glory. It was staggering, discombobulating, and – frankly – very, very weird.</p> <p>Asher-Smith admitted afterwards she had never had cramp in her life. Meanwhile Neita insisted that she had been so worried about an injury that she said a silent prayer. But as they shook their heads and licked their wounds, the huge 45,000 crowd in the Olympic Stadium got the miracle they craved as home favourite Gina Lückenkemper got up on the line to take a shock gold in 10.99sec.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/15/eilish-mccolgans-brave-run-produces-european-silver-in-10000m\">Eilish McColgan’s golden template falls short in European 10,000m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It all made for an extraordinary night. But just not the one anyone in the British contingent had envisioned. Neita at least took a bronze medal in 11 sec flat, just behind Switzerland’s Mujinga Kambundji, who claimed silver. But she had really wanted gold, and after blitzing her semi-final in 10.95 she had looked primed to get it.</p> <p>“When I was setting up my blocks for the final, I had the worst cramp I have ever had in my life,” Neita explained later. “I was looking for my coach to say I don’t think I can run. But after missing out on a final at worlds and not doing my best performance in the Commonwealths, I didn’t want to miss this final. So I rolled the dice.</p> <p>“I was saying a prayer – God, just get me through this. Honestly I could feel my whole right leg cramping up and I didn’t want to hurt anything. So I chilled through that race. I honestly do not know how I got a medal. But the gold should have been mine and it wasn’t.”</p> <p>Meanwhile Asher-Smith, who had come to Munich to defend her title despite suffering a hamstring injury last month, confirmed there was no serious damage and that she would go again in the 200m. “It was very irritated, very tight,” she said. “I wasn’t about to go and run a whole race on two cramping calves and possibly tear them. It’s just very annoying.”</p> <p>There was better news for Britain in the men’s 100m as Zharnel Hughes took silver and Jeremiah Azu bronze behind the Italian Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs.</p> <p>The race was always going to boil down to a simple equation: was Jacobs back to full fitness after withdrawing from the worlds in Eugene? If he was, then he would win gold. Anything less, though, would open the door.</p> <p>Victory in his semi-final showed Jacobs remained the man to beat. And in the final the Italian had enough to hold off the fast finishing Hughes as he came home in 9.95, 0.04 clear of the Briton. “I was closing with every step,” insisted Hughes. “But it has been a tough season and to come out here and deliver, I am very proud of myself.”</p> <p>Azu, meanwhile, was rightly delighted with a medal and a personal best of 10.13. “I saw first come up, I saw second come up and I said ‘surely I have done enough to get third?’” he said. “And I was waiting and waiting and I saw my name and just screamed.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7925b2b447271b373588a3b3d59736c28d6df0b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7925b2b447271b373588a3b3d59736c28d6df0b8/0_119_4398_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcell Jacobs of Italy crosses the line to claim another 100m gold.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcell Jacobs of Italy crosses the line to claim another 100m gold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However there was disappointment for Jacob Fincham-Dukes, who was demoted to fifth place in the long jump after appearing to take silver. It came after an appeal from France, which led to his best jump of 8.06m being voided due to his toe crossing the line. Olympic champion Miltos Tentoglou of Greece took gold in a championship best 8.52m.</p> <p>Earlier in the evening a packed stadium also roared its approval as the former world decathlon champion Niklas Kaul staged a dramatic late comeback with a 76m javelin throw and fast 1500m to win another home gold with 8,545 points, 77 ahead of Switzerland’s Simon Ehammer.</p> <p>However Croatia’s Sandra Perkovic denied Germany a third gold of the night in the women’s discus by defeating Germany’s Kristin Pudenz by eight centimetres – and in doing so became the first athlete in European championships history to win six individual titles.</p> <p>A night of high class athletics also saw the Norwegian 5,000m world champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen defend his European crown with another display of breezy brilliance.

Just say: ‘I need to be a stateswoman’ instead of throwing red meat to the ultras.</p> </blockquote> <p>Truss supporters in Scotland acknowledge they have advised her to adopt a less belligerent tone against Sturgeon: they insist Truss will follow Gove’s softly-softly strategy. </p> <p>One ally said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To me it was just a throwaway line at a hustings for a party audience.

written for the Guardian</strong> <strong>about the cost of living crisis. He writes that while the Conservatives support oil and gas giants, the current crisis could drag half of UK households into fuel poverty.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The cost of living emergency facing the British people is not an inevitable, unalterable fact of life. We are told so often by government ministers that the pain and anguish the British people are facing is something we have to get used to, and all we can do is tinker round the edges. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/energy-price-crisis-what-are-parties-and-tory-leader-hopefuls-proposing-labour-sunak-truss-starmer\">energy bill crisis </a>will devastate millions of families and could force <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2022/research/fuel-poverty-uk/\">more than half of British households</a> into fuel poverty. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour is not willing to stand by and allow that social catastrophe to happen. This is why Labour has proposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/15/keir-starmer-radical-plan-freeze-energy-bills-needed-cut-inflation\">freeze energy prices</a>.</p> <p>It’s important we understand the deeper lessons this moment teaches us. First, while some of the causes of this cost of living crisis are driven by global factors, its effects – who suffers, who pays and who government protects – are not predetermined. It is a deeply political decision: the Conservatives have opted to let families and businesses pay unsustainably high energy bills ​while oil and gas companies enjoy huge and unexpected profits.​</p> <p>The second lesson is that affordable energy should be a right for people across our society, and government must ensure that right. Whether a service is provided publicly or privately, there are duties of government that cannot be ducked. David Cameron accused me of “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-24639879\">living in a Marxist universe</a>” when I proposed applying a cap to energy bills as Labour leader. He was dead wrong. Markets need rules to prevent exploitation. Governments must be willing to intervene when there is a profound risk to people’s economic security. Beyond this crisis, we need to bring fundamental reform to our failing energy system, which is currently delivering neither affordability nor security for our country.</p> <p>Third, we must draw the right long-term conclusions about energy policy. This is not, as some would claim, the first net-zero crisis. It is just the latest fossil-fuel crisis. Our job should be to ensure that it is the last. The undeniable truth is that while we remain dependent on fossil fuels, we are vulnerable to the geopolitics of energy. Petrostates, dictators and politicians such as Vladimir Putin are using energy as a weapon of war. Gas prices currently stand at <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2022/07/17/uk-offshore-wind-costs-4-times-less-than-gas-fired-thermal-generation/\">four times the price</a> of the cheapest renewables.</p> <p>There is only one reliable, sustainable long-term path out of this crisis. That is to get on, now, with the clean energy sprint <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> has been calling for month after month. We should be investing in homegrown onshore wind energy, offshore wind, solar, hydrogen and nuclear energy as well as a national mission to insulate homes.</p> <p>The fourth lesson goes well beyond energy policy. It’s important to recognise that the energy insecurity millions of people face is a consequence of their financial insecurity and our economic insecurity. We live in a country where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62057301\">80% of people</a> have savings of less than £500. Twelve years of low growth under the Conservatives have left people, on average, much worse off.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full opinion piece here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/labour-freeze-bills-britain-energy-supply-government-conservatives\">Labour has a plan to freeze bills and secure Britain’s energy supply.

That’s not right, it’s not responsible and it’s certainly not Conservative,” he said.</p> \n<p>However, he again attacked Truss’s dismissal of further direct support for the most vulnerable, since her national insurance plans would have no effect on the poorest. “Millions of people are at risk of being tipped into destitution and that will be moral failure,” he said.</p> \n<p>Outside the venue, about 150 protesters, including trade union activists, independence campaigners, the Socialist Workers party and community campaigners, angrily demonstrated, some throwing eggs at delegates.</p> \n<p>In a rare glimpse of unity between the two candidates, Truss indicated she would offer Sunak a senior position in her cabinet if she were elected.</p> \n<p>She said: “It’s important that we unite the Conservative party. We’re all Conservatives. We all want to beat Nicola Sturgeon, we all want to beat Keir Starmer. I will want to appoint a cabinet with all the best candidates, including Rishi Sunak, if I win this election.”</p> \n<p>Truss also implied she had begun brokering a deal with the Democratic Unionist party to rejoin Stormont’s power-sharing government with Sinn Féin, but that hinged on reforms to the Northern Ireland protocol which are being opposed by the EU.</p> \n<p>A Northern Irish delegate said her family were anxious to see Stormont’s government running again. Truss said she had been in talks with the DUP about her Northern Ireland protocol bill, adding: “I expect to see things happening and the executive reforming.”</p> \n<p>Both contenders won applause from the Tory members present, a large majority of whom said at the start of the event they had not yet voted in the contest, by firmly ruling out supporting a second Scottish independence referendum.</p> \n<p>Sunak agreed the UK was a union built on “consent and democracy” but added: “It’s quite frankly barmy for politicians to focus on a divisive referendum when we’re in a cost of living crisis.”</p> \n<p>To loud applause, Truss reminded members she had been to primary school in the Scottish city of Paisley. “To me, we’re not just neighbours, we’re family and I will never ever let our family be split up,” she said.</p> \n<p>But she moderated her attack on Sturgeon in Exeter two weeks ago, when she claimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-dismissal-of-attention-seeker-sturgeon-will-horrify-scots-says-snp\">the first minister was an “attention-seeker”</a> who needed to be ignored. Truss’s Scottish allies have told her that was unnecessarily antagonistic.</p> \n<p>“What I’m going to ignore is these constant calls for a referendum,” Truss told delegates in Perth. “I will help Douglas Ross to work in a constructive way to help the people of Scotland.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/aug/16/biden-climate-healthcare-bill-inflation-reduction-act-democrats-us-politics-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T20:11:58Z","webTitle":"Biden hails ‘biggest step forward on climate ever’ as he signs Inflation Reduction Act – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/aug/16/biden-climate-healthcare-bill-inflation-reduction-act-democrats-us-politics-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/aug/16/biden-climate-healthcare-bill-inflation-reduction-act-democrats-us-politics-latest","fields":{"headline":"Biden hails ‘biggest step forward on climate ever’ as he signs Inflation Reduction Act – as it happened","trailText":"White House hopes climate and healthcare plan will mark turning point for Biden’s presidency and boost Democrats in the midterms","byline":"Chris Stein","body":"<div id=\"block-62fbf3778f083e25be0eba6d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T20:11:58.941Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Joe Biden </strong>signed into law his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/aug/16/biden-climate-healthcare-bill-inflation-reduction-act-democrats-us-politics-latest?page=with:block-62fbf5358f08b9fd3e4dfea1#block-62fbf5358f08b9fd3e4dfea1\">landmark spending plan</a> to fight the climate crisis and lower healthcare costs, in what his administration hopes will turn around the president’s fortunes after months of worrying unpopularity.

This afternoon, he will sign a marquee spending plan that emerged after a year of stop-and-start negotiations, which at times looked like they would ended up achieving nothing. Dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, the measure marks Washington’s most forceful attempt yet to slash emissions, and is also meant to lower prescription drug prices.

The PNG government estimates that just 15% of children in the country have had their births officially registered. This compares to 75% of births worldwide and 88% in neighbouring Solomon Islands.</p> <p>Without this documentation, exploitation and trafficking are far easier.</p> <p>“We are currently looking after about 45 children,” said Collin Pake, founder and director of Life PNG Care. “But we have done our own surveys in Port Moresby and we estimate there are about 20,000 homeless children in the city. About 70% of the children in our care don’t have birth certificates and don’t know their birth dates. When we ask what their age is, they just guess.”</p> <p>Of the 500 children aged one to 12 in the care of another welfare organisation, PNG Hope for Poor Kids Care in Port Moresby, just 20 had birth certificates, said Martin Piason, its founder and chairman. </p> <p>Leisha Lister, an international law and justice consultant in Canberra, said the situation was “terrifying for children”.</p> <p>“Children who don’t have any legal identity documents are very easily trafficked, moved on and new documents created for them. A birth certificate prevents the child from being trafficked by someone who isn’t a family member. It’s the foundation for protecting children.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fe9d707d99b59239cae18972f3142895636a979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fe9d707d99b59239cae18972f3142895636a979/0_346_5181_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child sitting on an adult’s lap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Child trafficking has been identified as an issue of concern in Papua New Guinea, particularly for children living on the streets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Davidson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fiu Williame-Igara, country director for Save the Children, said the low rate of birth registration was a key factor that left children vulnerable in PNG. “This creates a perfect storm for children’s vulnerability when compounded with widespread poverty, growing squatter settlements in urban areas, large numbers of people living in one household, parents neglecting their children and peer pressure.” </p> <p>Government reports identify child trafficking as an issue of concern in the country and a survey of children in Port Moresby in 2012 by the International Labour Organisation showed a high prevalence of child labour and sexual exploitation among children living on the streets of the capital. The organisation reported that 68% of children surveyed were in hazardous work, 43% were in commercial sex work and 47% had never been to school.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s not made clear to parents and families that birth registration is mandatory</p> <footer> <cite>Fiu Williame-Igara, Save the Children</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“It’s difficult to overstate the devastating social, mental and physical health impacts on children who suffer neglect, abuse or exploitation,” Williame-Igara said.</p> <p>In PNG, infants born outside of urban centres and health facilities often miss out on a birth certificate.</p> <p>“Sixty per cent of [births each year] are village home births, virtually none of which are registered at the government registry of births and deaths,” says Prof Glen Mola, head of obstetrics and gynaecology at Port Moresby general hospital.</p> <p>“Of the 40% of births that occur in health facilities, our anecdotal evidence is that less than 10% of parents go to the registry office to register the birth of their child.”</p> <p>Williame-Igara said: “It’s not made clear to parents and families that birth registration is mandatory and, with 80% of the population living in rural or remote communities, many face difficulties in reaching the nearest government station to register a new birth.”</p> <p>However, PNG’s civil registry office has also been ineffective for years. It was assessed as “dysfunctional” by leading regional group SPC in 2014.</p> <p>Two years ago, the government launched a national action plan and aims to train and resource health staff and services to boost registration. It’s a huge challenge given the country’s overstretched health system – already coping with the pandemic and disease burdens, such as tuberculosis and diabetes, and weak reach into distant provincial areas.</p> <p>Lister emphasised that, among a raft of measures needed, registration should be made easier, especially for rural families and the illiterate, fees eliminated and information about how and why obtaining a birth certificate is important disseminated throughout the country.</p> <p>But Magalu Banagi, program manager at City Mission PNG, said the responsibility laid with parents as well. “We need to train the parents.

Dominic Raab wrote that chapter – he’s backing Rishi Sunak.”</p> \n<p>Raab later claimed that the authors, who also included Priti Patel and Kwasi Kwarteng, had taken “collective responsibility” for the book, adding: “It’s up to Liz to explain why she’s changed her view.”</p> \n<p>In the leaked recording, Truss claimed that the book had been “mischaracterised” at the time of its release a decade ago, but gave no detail as to how she felt the passage had been misrepresented.</p> \n<p>Truss’s remarks about the productivity of workers outside London could be particularly damaging as earlier this month she was forced to make a U-turn on plans to cut civil service pay outside the capital after a furious outcry from Conservative MPs.</p> \n<p>She claimed there had been a “wilful misrepresentation” of her policy – despite her campaign having published specific details – but confirmed she was abandoning plans for regional pay boards for civil servants or public sector workers.</p> \n<p>London had the highest productivity level of any UK region in 2020, with output per hour more than 50% higher than the median, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> \n<p>However, this is widely believed to be the result of large multinationals being based in the capital, higher engagement with research and development, the size of firms and the level of exports, and the transport infrastructure.</p> \n<p>In the leaked recording, Truss began: “I once wrote a book about this which got mischaracterised – British workers produce less per hour than … and that’s a combination of kind of skill and application.”</p> \n<p>She went on: “If you look at productivity, it’s very, very different in London from the rest of the country. But basically … this has been a historical fact for decades. Essentially it’s partly a mindset and attitude thing, I think. It’s working culture, basically. If you go to China it’s quite different, I can assure you.”</p> \n<p>The minister, who had close oversight of public spending, added: “There’s a fundamental issue of British working culture. Essentially, if we’re going to be a richer country and a more prosperous country, that needs to change. But I don’t think people are that keen to change that.</p> \n<p>“There’s a slight thing in Britain about wanting the easy answers. That’s my reflection on the election and what’s gone before it, and the referendum – we say it’s all Europe that’s causing these huge problems … it’s all these migrants causing these problems. But actually what needs to happen is more … more graft. It’s not a popular message.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&amp;description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.org%2Fen%2F%22%3ESignal%20Messenger%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Contact the team securely: create a Protonmail account and email us at guardian.politics.desk@protonmail.com; or use Signal Messenger or WhatsApp to message +44 7824 537227.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&amp;description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.org%2Fen%2F%22%3ESignal%20Messenger%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&amp;link=false\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Truss was questioned about the Guardian’s revelations during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/16/cost-of-living-crisis-covid-vaccine-conservative-leadership-liz-truss-rishi-sunak?page=with:block-62fbf05c8f08595b289df570#block-62fbf05c8f08595b289df570\">Tory leadership hustings in Perth</a>, and appeared to confirm she still believed British workers were not as productive as they should be.</p> \n<p>Asked by Colin Mackay, STV’s political editor and chair of the hustings, whether she stood by those remarks, Truss said: “I don’t know what you’re quoting there [but] what we need in this country is more productivity and we need more economic growth.</p> \n<p>“The thing is we don’t have enough of is capital investment, which why it’s important to get more investment in the whisky industry and North Sea.”</p> \n<p>The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “With wages shrinking thanks to Tory failure to bring inflation under control and years of lacklustre growth, it’s grossly offensive for Liz Truss to effectively brand British workers lazy.</p> \n<p>“I would have hoped she had moved on from the days of her Britannia Unchained fiasco, but it seems that is the blueprint for her prospective government.

But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/leaked-audio-reveals-liz-truss-said-british-workers-needed-more-graft\">Liz Truss’s extraordinary comments</a> when she was No 2 at the Treasury appear to do just that.</p> <p>It is no secret that London and the south-east have the highest productivity of any UK region by some way, according to official statistics. But you’d be hard pressed to find any economist who believes this is down to the “mindset” of workers in other parts of the country.</p> <p>In reality, the plethora of big international businesses in the capital, booming financial and services industries, huge R&amp;D spend and the best transport infrastructure in Britain are the principal reasons.</p> <p>The fact that too many other parts of the country don’t have these in-built advantages was exactly what the government’s levelling up promises were supposed to address.</p> <p>Truss is already on the back foot on tackling regional inequalities after her damaging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-u-turns-plan-cut-public-sector-pay-outside-london-tory-leadership\">U-turn on regional pay</a>, which prompted the Labour party to call her “Levelling Down Liz”.</p> <p>In response, Truss committed to continuing the levelling up agenda but in a “Conservative way” – which has been taken to mean a focus on tax cuts and deregulation, rather than high spending and investment.</p> <p>Her rival, Rishi Sunak, has also come unstuck on levelling up – despite his promises to prioritise the issue and endorsements from a host of “red wall” Tory MPs – by admitting taking money from deprived urban areas in order to give it to wealthier parts of the country.</p> <p>The productivity gap is not just a problem for the Conservative party. If Labour make it into power they will also need to urgently address Britain’s outlier status on regional inequality.</p> <p>Truss’s comments from her time at the Treasury, revealed in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2022/aug/16/british-workers-need-more-graft-says-liz-truss-in-leaked-recording-audio\">leaked recording to the Guardian</a>, are in danger of undermining her already fragile commitment to levelling up.</p> <p>They also open her up to charges of talking down the UK – a serious offence as far as some of her Tory colleagues are concerned – despite her best endeavours with union flags, “Global Britain” and belligerent attacks on Brussels and the Scottish government.</p> <p>But her views are not particularly new. They echo a controversial passage in a book, Britannia Unchained, she co-authored with four other Tory MPs including Dominic Raab and Kwasi Kwarteng, her likely chancellor if she makes it to No 10.</p> <p>“Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world,” they wrote. “We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.”</p> <p>Truss does, at least, appear to recognise while some Tory members may share her views, any hints she may be less than supportive of British workers might not go down too well with the broader public.</p> <p>At the first televised head-to-head debate with Sunak she couldn’t distance herself from the book fast enough, blaming the chapter on Raab even though they’d taken a collective decision to write it.</p> <p>But as the leaked recording confirms, not only did she have that view of British workers at the time but she also held it many years later. Some will draw the conclusion that she still does.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/16/manchester-united-size-up-casemiro-move-with-adrien-rabiot-bid-set-to-fail","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T19:40:24Z","webTitle":"Manchester United size up Casemiro move with Adrien Rabiot bid set to fail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/manchester-united-size-up-casemiro-move-with-adrien-rabiot-bid-set-to-fail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/16/manchester-united-size-up-casemiro-move-with-adrien-rabiot-bid-set-to-fail","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United size up Casemiro move with Adrien Rabiot bid set to fail","trailText":"Manchester United’s attempt to buy Juventus’s Adrien Rabiot is almost certainly off because of the midfielder’s wage demands, and Real Madrid’s Casemiro is being explored as an alternative","byline":"Jamie Jackson","body":"<p>Manchester United’s attempt to buy Juventus’s Adrien Rabiot is almost certainly off because of the midfielder’s wage demands, and Real Madrid’s Casemiro is being explored as an alternative to strengthen this department of Erik ten Hag’s squad.</p> <p>United had reached an agreed fee with Juventus of an initial £15m for Rabiot but the 27-year-old player’s mother and agent, Veronique, wished him to be paid more than many of the club’s top earners such as Bruno Fernandes, who receives around £240,000 a week.

As an inexperienced wildcard about to meet the No 1 player in the world, he did not know what to do.</p> <p>“He came up to me and introduced himself, which I thought was extremely humble of him and nice,” Norrie recalled, smiling. “I think I was practising with him later that week or in the afternoon.

On Wednesday at the Western &amp; Southern Open in Cincinnati’s suburbs, Norrie and Murray will face each other in the second round as equals. Murray remains the former world No 1 who has achieved so much in this sport, but these days Norrie is naturally the clear favourite as a top‑10 player in the form of his life.</p> <p>“It definitely took me a couple of years to catch up with my level,” Norrie said. “For the most part, I was having to play at my best in practice to keep up with him. I think, probably nowadays it’s pretty even between us. We always have good practices.”</p> <p>As their relationship has built and a rapport has developed, Norrie says Murray has played a helpful role in his career. They train together frequently when both are at home in London and he often uses Murray as a sounding board, never afraid to seek him out for advice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"428b98822e8144a351eeef6f59ec259677e0814a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/428b98822e8144a351eeef6f59ec259677e0814a/0_126_3831_2299/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray with Cameron Norrie as they prepare to practise at Queen’s Club in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Murray with Cameron Norrie as they prepare to practise at Queen’s Club in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrik Lundin/Getty Images for LTA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I’m always picking his brains on certain situations, what he thinks about certain players, how they play and tactics,” he said. “Everything, really.

To be practising with him a lot, to be spending time with him quite a lot, it’s pretty cool to pick his brain on a few things.”</p> <p>Since his breakout run to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/08/cameron-norrie-exits-wimbledon-to-ovation-after-semi-final-defeat\" title=\"\">semi-finals of Wimbledon</a>, Norrie has continued his quiet progress. He reached a final in his very next tournament, in Los Cabs, beating the No 9, Félix Auger-Aliassime, before finishing as runner-up to Daniil Medvedev. Last week he reached the third round of the National Bank Open in Montreal before falling to Auger-Aliassime.</p> <p>He has continued to do as he always does, winning the matches he should do, making himself a supreme challenge against the best players in the world and picking off plenty of them in the process.</p> <p>On Monday, as Murray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/15/andy-murray-battles-form-and-fitness-to-defeat-stan-wawrinka\" title=\"\">barely edged out Stan Wawrinka</a> in nearly three hours, Norrie was in his own battle. He narrowly moved past the 19-year-old Holger Rune, winning 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-4. Norrie said he felt uncharacteristically nervous and was not able to find anything close to his top level. But as he has done so often over the past 18 months, he found a way to secure victory.</p> <p>With his success, life has changed for Norrie in various ways. He is now reliably recognised on the streets of the UK and in the days after Wimbledon he found himself being offered freebies wherever he went.

Analysts say the Yuan Wang’s moves will also be closely monitored by the US and western allies as they have long criticised Beijing’s dealings with Sri Lanka.</p> <p>Officially, Sri Lanka has referred to the Yuan Wang 5 as a “scientific research ship”. “But the suspicion here in India is that despite Chinese commentators’ insistence it is civilian, it may actually have military functions,” said Prof Srikanth Kondapalli, dean of the school of international studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/china-funnels-overseas-aid-money-political-leaders-home-provinces\">China funnels its overseas aid money into political leaders’ home provinces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday, Indian news outlets remarked on the latest development. “The Yuan Wang 5 is a powerful tracking vessel whose significant aerial reach – reportedly around 750km – means that several ports in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh could be on China’s radar,” the Indian Express newspaper wrote.</p> <p>Brahma Chellaney, a former member of India’s national security advisory board, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chellaney/status/1559469866029002758?s=20&amp;t=S0JtyEVQTjE-2YlkAZDreQ\">on Twitter</a>: “When a small, bankrupt nation like Sri Lanka delivers a diplomatic slap to New Delhi by hosting a Chinese surveillance ship at its commercial port of Hambantota, it is a stunning reminder of both India’s feckless foreign policy and receding influence in its strategic back yard.”</p> <p>The China ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, dismissed such concerns. “The marine scientific research conducted by the research ship Yuan Wang 5 conforms to international law and international common practice, and will not affect the security and economic interests of any country,” he told a news briefing on Tuesday.</p> <p>Sri Lanka has in recent months been mired in serious economic trouble.

Ben Stokes has been among them, England’s Test captain itching to rekindle the magic that lit up the first half of the summer through those four rip-roaring victories against New Zealand and India.</p> \n<p>To that end Stokes held a team meeting on Sunday when his players reconvened before the first Test against South Africa which starts on Wednesday; a refresher course intended to reaffirm the positive ethos that himself and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, are demanding.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/16/england-bazball-approach-in-south-africa-heads-ben-stokes-dean-elgar\">England’s ‘Bazball’ approach has got in South Africa’s heads, claims Ben Stokes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“It’s the last time I will ever write on a whiteboard,” he joked after their final training session on Tuesday. “I needed to ask how to spell ‘environment’.”</p> \n<p>Stokes may be unsure of the precise letters in the word but appears to have a firm grasp on its meaning. Players young and old are visibly relishing the new ethos of relaxed training sessions, aggressive play and selectorial loyalty under his leadership. Winning clearly helps here but their upbeat approach to each day and session has been an obvious point of difference from the angst of the previous regime’s final year.</p> \n<p>There have of course been sliding‑doors moments along the way, be it Colin de Grandhomme’s no-ball at Lord’s, dropped catches at Trent Bridge or New Zealand’s failure to review an lbw shout against Jamie Overton at Headingley just five runs into a score of 97 that made up one half of a match-defining seventh‑wicket stand of 241. England have also profited from the particularly celestial form of Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root, the pair making hay against what was a substandard batch of Dukes balls.</p> \n<p>But they have also wriggled out of some tight spots characterfully, such as shipping 553 against New Zealand at Trent Bridge or overcoming a first‑innings deficit of 132 against India at Edgbaston. Four targets they may previously have baulked at have also been vaporised, not that Stokes is too fussed about the end result. “Honestly, if we’d lost 4-0 I wouldn’t be sitting here changing the way I ask the lads to go out and play,” he said.</p> \n<p>The hope now, he said, was this filters down to the county game and energises the support base for both England and the longer format as a whole.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a76eb406138cecc85728812ed3eb06b4e241440\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a76eb406138cecc85728812ed3eb06b4e241440/0_122_4317_2590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson (left) are expected to lead England’s attack again at Lord’s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson (left) are expected to lead England’s attack again at Lord’s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The question asked by many in response is how England will fare when they bat first and how sustainable this all is long term. After the diet of white-ball internationals and the Hundred comes a three-match series against South Africa, the leading side in the World Test Championship, and thus the latest examination. That said, a little extra patience may still be required. The recent heatwave has turned London’s parks and commons as beige as one of Richie Benaud’s jackets – Lord’s, lush green, has remained immune – but the forecast for day one is not too clever.</p> \n<p>Dean Elgar, a South Africa captain whose batting is likely to exhaust the synonyms for “gritty” over the next four weeks, is among the sceptics regarding “Bazball”. He said he is braced for passages of play when the numbers on the scoreboard spin like wheels of a fruit machine but, while insisting he was not criticising the efforts of New Zealand and India in the field, fancies his attack will serve as the antidote overall. “I would like to think from a bowling point of view, our bowlers are big, tall, fast and strong buggers and we have ticked the boxes in regards to the spin department,” he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f8b66ade-48bc-4f77-875c-046e9916f249\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England</b> (confirmed): Alex Lees, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes (c), Ben Foakes (wk), Jack Leach, Matt Potts, Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson.</p>\n    <p><b>South Africa</b> (possible): Dean Elgar (c), Sarel Erwee, Keegan Petersen, Aidan Markram, Rassie van der Dussen, Kyle Verryenne (wk), Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Among them is the classy Kagiso Rabada, light on overs but expected to be fit after an ankle injury, similarly Lungi Ngidi and the pacy Anrich Nortje who also sat out the recent warmup against the Lions. If selected, the newcomer Marco Jansen offers a left-arm angle from a 6ft 7in frame – even if his required deployment at No 7 would look high – and they have two seasoned spinners to choose from in Keshav Maharaj and Simon Harmer. The former is likely to get the nod at Lord’s despite a mauling from the Lions but the latter – a proven expert on English surfaces – should feature at some stage.</p> \n<p>Stokes described England’s selection as “easy”, their only tweak coming via a return for Ben Foakes behind the stumps after missing Edgbaston with Covid-19. While Ollie Robinson appears sharp and incisive once more after early season fitness issues, Stokes and McCullum feel Stuart Broad’s interventions – such as the third-morning “team hat-trick” against New Zealand on this ground – outweigh his record of 15 wickets at 38 this summer. If Broad and Jimmy Anderson open the bowling in both innings they will have done so in 200 innings in Test cricket, while the former is also one wicket away from 100 Test victims at Lord’s.</p> \n<p>Both veterans will be keen to see if the latest Dukes balls to come out of the factory in Walthamstow hold up better than those used previously – the flip side being that if they are hardier than before, more questions may be asked of the batters.</p> \n<p>During a different time, a player such as Zak Crawley – averaging 17.75 so far this summer – would be deemed to be playing for his spot. But Stokes was having none of it, hailing the right-hander’s selfless approach and describing his 100-run opening stand with Alex Lees during the run chase at Edgbaston as his favourite passage of play to date.</p> \n<p>Such a response is pretty much the Stokes way these days. He may have retired from one-day internationals recently and decided the whiteboard is not for him but, when it comes to England’s approach to Test cricket, the captain’s mind is very much made up.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/16/donald-trump-search-affidavit-legal-cases","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T18:43:27Z","webTitle":"Judge to consider unsealing Trump search affidavit as legal worries mount","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/donald-trump-search-affidavit-legal-cases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/donald-trump-search-affidavit-legal-cases","fields":{"headline":"Judge to consider unsealing Trump search affidavit as legal worries mount","trailText":"Justice department says making Mar-a-Lago affidavit public could jeopardize investigation as White House lawyers receive subpoenas in separate case","byline":"Lauren Gambino in Washington","body":"<p>A federal judge in Florida will hear arguments on Thursday over whether<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-search-justice-department\"> to make public an affidavit</a> used to justify a search of Donald Trump’s Florida estate, as broadening legal disputes on multiple fronts intensify against the former president and his allies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-search-justice-department\">Justice department asks not to disclose affidavit behind Mar-a-Lago search</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a 13-page filing on Monday, the justice department objected to efforts to unseal the document, arguing that doing so would “jeopardize the integrity of this national security investigation” into Trump’s handling of some of the government’s most closely held records after leaving the White House. The prosecutors said that the affidavit that gave the FBI probable cause to search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump’s</a> Mar-a-Lago resort contained sensitive information about witnesses who are key and acknowledged that its investigation involved “highly classified material”.</p> <p>Bruce Reinhart, the federal magistrate judge who signed off on the search warrant, will decide whether to publish the affidavit, which would provide more details about the investigation and the FBI’s search of Trump’s private residence. Trump and his allies, including some members of Congress, have also pushed for the release of the affidavit.</p> <p>But the prosecutors said the affidavit should not be unsealed because that could reveal the scope of the investigation into Trump’s unauthorized retention of classified White House records.</p> <p>“The affidavit would serve as a roadmap to the government’s ongoing investigation, providing specific details about its direction and likely course,” prosecutors wrote. They also argued that releasing the document could compromise the continuing investigation.</p> <p>“Disclosure of the government’s affidavit at this stage would also likely chill future cooperation by witnesses whose assistance may be sought as this investigation progresses, as well as in other high-profile investigations,” prosecutors added.</p> <p>Last week, Reinhart agreed to unseal the search warrant and a list of items removed from the property after the justice department, in a rare move, asked for the documents to be made public given the “substantial public interest” in the investigation. Trump did not oppose the release of the materials, which he had refused to disclose publicly.</p> <p>FBI agents seized about 20 boxes of materials, among them documents designated “top secret”, a grant of clemency for Trump’s close ally, Roger Stone, and information related to the “president of France”, according to the list of items removed from the property. The search warrant, unsealed on Friday, revealed that federal agents were investigating potential violation of the Espionage Act, among other laws.</p> <p>Trump has sought to cast himself as a victim of a political witch-hunt designed to keep him from running for office, even as his campaign gleefully shares news stories claiming his recent legal troubles have only served to strengthen his support.</p> <p>The tussle over the affidavit is only the latest in a series of legal obstacles that could trip up Trump and his closest allies.</p> <p>This week, Trump’s former attorney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Giuliani</a> was informed that he is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/rudy-giuliani-target-criminal-investigation-georgia-election\"> a target of a criminal investigation </a>in Georgia related to efforts by the former president and his legal team to invalidate Joe Biden’s electoral victory in the state. The notification came as a federal judge rejected an attempt by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, another prominent Trump ally, to avoid testifying in the same investigation before the special grand jury in Atlanta.</p> <p>As his personal lawyer, Giuliani led the efforts to keep Trump in power, which included brazen attempts to overturn the results of elections in key states that Trump lost. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, is scheduled to testify before the special grand jury in Atlanta on Wednesday. He is expected to invoke attorney-client privilege on questions related to his discussions with Trump over those efforts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/rudy-giuliani-target-criminal-investigation-georgia-election\">the Guardian has reported</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump took a similar approach when questioned under oath last week in New York state’s long-running civil investigation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/10/donald-trump-deposition-new-york-business-investigation\">into his business practices</a>. In a statement, Trump claimed to have done nothing improper but invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination.</p> <p>And all that comes against the backdrop of the justice department’s intensifying investigation into the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and Trump’s attempts to reverse his defeat.

David Black even waved a metaphorical big stick at a couple of firms. “I think that companies like Thames and Southern really need to up their game,” he said.</p> <p>He described Thames as “a repeated poor performer”. And he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/25/southern-water-penalty-customers\">Ofwat’s £126m penalty on Southern in 2019</a> for wastewater and reporting breaches was instrumental in forcing a change of ownership last year. “That’s an example of a company that performed poorly, that was held to account by Ofwat and the investors lost their shirt,” argued Black. “That is exactly as it should be.”</p> <p>What this breezy accounted omitted to mention, however, was that the Ofwat-approved rescuer of Southern Water <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/aug/09/macquarie-wades-back-into-uk-with-majority-stake-in-southern-water\">was none other than Macquarie</a>, the giant Australian financial outfit whose ownership of Thames from 2006 to 2017 was characterised by supercharged debt financing, heavy dividend extraction, missed leakage targets and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/22/thames-water-hit-with-record-fine-for-huge-sewage-leaks\">a major sewage-dumping prosecution</a>.

If half the shareholder base, including founder Ray Kelvin with his 11.5% stake, wish to take the cash, the board is in no position to resist. Besides there’s the small matter of “the uncertain economic environment”, as chair Helena Feltham put it. Yes, the consumer weather has taken a turn for the worse since March.</p> <p>All the same, submitting to a lowball £211m offer from a US turnaround merchant is a lacklustre way to bow out. Ted Baker was never a retailing powerhouse, but, in his day, Kelvin had carved out an interesting niche in the market. Profits warnings, accounting tangles and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/04/ted-baker-boss-ray-kelvin-quits\">the “forced hugs” affair that forced his exit in 2019</a> changed the picture obviously, and then Covid arrived. But a recovery of sorts seemed to be under way.</p> <p>One can only assume the big shareholders, led by Toscafund and Schroders, are terrified about the possible impact of those economic uncertainties. They may be right to be so.</p> <h2>Another net gain for the US?</h2> <p>Farewell Darktrace, then? We hardly knew you, let alone understood how those cybersecurity tools work.</p> <p>Well, the takeover approach from US private equity firm Thoma Bravo isn’t yet a formal offer, so it’s too soon to say Darktrace’s 15 months as a quoted company in London are drawing to a close. But the 24% leap in the share price says the market is betting the way.</p> <p>At 515p, producing a value of £3.4bn, the share price has doubled since flotation. On the other hand, the peak was almost £10, which shows how hard it is to value high-growth, loss-making firms in whizzy fields like cybersecurity.</p> <p>The other complication, of course, is Darktrace’s links to shareholder and early backer Mike Lynch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/28/tech-entrepreneur-mike-lynch-can-be-extradited-to-us-rules-priti-patel\">the Autonomy founder fighting extradition to the US</a> on fraud charges, which he denies. The company’s listing in London seemed to be partly driven by a desire to demonstrate independence from Lynch but has never fully achieved that goal. As a multiple of revenues, Darktrace’s value lags foreign peers’. Therein lies a possible opportunity for a bidder to benefit from a clean break.</p> <p>Assuming, that is, UK ministers don’t throw a few obstacles in the path of yet another US tech takeover. One assumes they won’t, but it’s not impossible.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/16/scotland-appoints-man-as-first-ever-period-dignity-regional-lead","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T18:16:12Z","webTitle":"Scottish group appoints man as first ever period dignity regional lead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/16/scotland-appoints-man-as-first-ever-period-dignity-regional-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/16/scotland-appoints-man-as-first-ever-period-dignity-regional-lead","fields":{"headline":"Scottish group appoints man as first ever period dignity regional lead","trailText":"Jason Grant’s appointment in Tay region receives incredulous response","byline":"Libby Brooks Scotland correspondent","body":"<p>The appointment of a man to a new regional role promoting period dignity has provoked criticism and consternation.</p> <p>Jason Grant, who has previously worked in tobacco sales and as a personal trainer, was announced as the period dignity regional lead officer for the Tay region earlier this week, in what is believed to be the first role of its kind in the country and prompted by groundbreaking women’s health legislation.</p> <p>But his appointment has received an incredulous response. Former Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova posted on Twitter: “This is just f****** ridiculous,” adding: “Have we ever tried to explain to men how to shave or how to take care of their prostate or whatever?!? This is absurd.”</p> <p>Other commentators immediately linked Grant’s appointment – which is funded by the Scottish government but chosen by a local team of councils and colleges – to recent Holyrood <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/02/scotlands-long-awaited-gender-recognition-reform-bill-to-be-published\">rows over sex and gender</a>.</p> <p>But the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told Sky News that it was “far better that women are in these posts than anyone else”.</p> <p>“It’s a policy that we should all be proud of. At the end of the day, I think there should be a priority of having women in place in these posts.”</p> <p>Scotland was the first country in the world to provide free and universal access to period products when it passed the Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Act 2021, which became law this week.</p> <p>Monica Lennon, the Scottish Labour MSP who spearheaded a four-year campaign that has shifted the public discourse around menstruation, said it was important that women’s voices were not crowded out.</p> <p>“Inclusive period dignity is at the heart of the Period Products Act. Actively promoting universal free access to period products and investing in menstrual health and wellbeing will help eradicate stigma, misogyny and inequality.”</p> <p>“There’s a role for men taking on leadership roles and contributing to positive and respectful conversations whilst ensuring that the voices of women, girls and people who menstruate are never crowded out.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Period Dignity Working Group, which comprises Dundee and Angus College, Angus council, Dundee city council and Perth College UHI underlined that the role was largely focused on project management.</p> <p>“By changing the culture, encouraging debate and removing the stigma around periods, we look forward to supporting the delivery of this important work across the region.”</p> <p>In a press release announcing his appointment, Grant said: “I think being a man will help me to break down barriers, reduce stigma and encourage more open discussions. Although affecting women directly, periods are an issue for everyone. We’ll also raise awareness of the menopause, which, although a natural process for women, has wider repercussions in the world of work and family.</p> <p>“It’s time to normalise these topics and get real around the subject. I believe I can make progress by proving this isn’t just a female topic, encouraging conversations across all genders and educating and engaging new audiences.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-174-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T18:11:14Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 174 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-174-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-174-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 174 of the invasion","trailText":"Explosions rock an ammunition depot in Crimea, as the Russian defence minister says the country has no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine","byline":"Samantha Lock and Joe Middleton","body":"<ul> <li><p><strong>Explosions erupted across Crimea on Tuesday, with reports of smoke and fire in at least three different areas where military bases or munitions depots are located. </strong>The first one, at an ammunitions depot near Dzhankoi in the north, severely disrupted railway services and wounded two people.

He answered: “Yes. More than once. Many times.”</p> <p>Asked by his barrister, Chris Daw QC, if his reputation as a “love cheat” was justified, Giggs said: “Yes.”</p> <p>Asked if he was able to resist women if he was attracted to them, despite being in a relationship, he said: “No.”</p> <p>Giggs told the jury at Manchester crown court he had never physically assaulted or used coercive and controlling behaviour on women.</p> <p>He has denied deliberately head-butting Greville and elbowing her younger sister in the face during a drunken row at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, on 1 November 2020.</p> <p>The former Wales manager also denies manipulating Greville over a period of three years leading up to their separation.</p> <p>Greville, 36, has accused Giggs of making her life “utter hell”, isolating her from friends and family and destroying her self-confidence during their “toxic” on-off relationship.</p> <p>Giggs described how he “fell in love” with Greville after meeting her while she worked as a PR person for his hospitality business with Gary Neville.</p> <p>They were both married at the time, he said, but they began an affair, and within three or four months she left her husband for Giggs, who left his wife several months later.</p> <p>Giggs told the jury: “Me and my wife had problems. I cheated on my ex-wife, which was quite a public affair.</p> <p>“We got over that and things were good and it was a part of my life where I was just finishing football and going into a coaching career which was longer hours, more time away from the house and away from the family and Stacey.</p> <p>“I wasn’t giving the Stacey the attention she deserved. Eventually we were getting more and more unhappy. Gradually it became more and more difficult.”</p> <p>Giggs was asked about an incident in which he is alleged to have thrown Greville naked out of a hotel room in Dubai in September 2017. Greville has claimed Giggs dragged her across the floor of his hotel room before throwing her belongings into a corridor.</p> <p>Giggs denied any “physical element” to the argument and said he started packing Greville’s suitcase after telling her he did not want her to stay with him. He said he eventually let her sleep in his bed.</p> <p>He said they then had sex. Asked by Daw what sort of sex they had, Giggs said: “Sex that we would have quite often which could get rough – but not anything weird but just rough sex.”</p> <p>Giggs’s defence is that Greville sustained bruising to her wrist because of rough sex – not, as the prosecution claim, because he grabbed her arm during an argument.</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, the jury heard that Giggs told police following his arrest for allegedly head-butting Greville in November 2020 that “during this scuffle my head clashed with hers”.</p> <p>He added: “I am not sure if it was the face or head but I am sure it was not deliberate.”</p> <p>He told detectives in a prepared statement that he felt “extremely distressed, hurt and emotional” that Greville had alleged that he had been coercive and controlling.</p> <p>Giggs claims to police that it was Greville who had tried to “control our relationship”. He said: “She ordered me to message certain women with whom she incorrectly accused me of having an affair … She dictated the content of the messages and watched me while I sent them.”</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-imposes-conditions-on-nuclear-plant-visit-zelenskiy-shakes-up-security-chiefs-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T18:00:21Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: explosions reported in Crimea; Kyiv publishes identities of soldiers accused of war crimes – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-imposes-conditions-on-nuclear-plant-visit-zelenskiy-shakes-up-security-chiefs-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/16/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-imposes-conditions-on-nuclear-plant-visit-zelenskiy-shakes-up-security-chiefs-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: explosions reported in Crimea; Kyiv publishes identities of soldiers accused of war crimes – as it happened","trailText":"Blasts reported in Simferopol and Mayskoye; eight Russian soldiers suspected of war crimes in Bucha identified by Ukraine","byline":"Vivian Ho (now), Joe Middleton and  Samantha Lock (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62fbd5fa8f0895a5c6c71de3\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T18:00:21.801Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It’s 9pm right now in <strong>Ukraine</strong>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>In an exclusive with the Guardian, <strong>Mykhailo Podolyak</strong>, a key adviser to <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, said there could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to today’s mysterious strikes on a <strong>railway junction</strong> and <strong>airbase</strong> in <strong>Crimea</strong>.

Now, reports of explosions and black smoke at a military airbase in Gvardeyskoye, near the middle of the region.

Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one to 13.</em></p> <h2>That’s Saul folks</h2> <p>Eighty-six years. Not bad for more malfeasance in 18 months than most could cram into a lifetime. Saul Goodman has been found, caught, tried and sentenced to a stretch in “The Alcatraz of the Rockies”. But in an unexpected turn of events, our protagonist pulls off one last remarkable plea deal: Saul goes to prison, yes, but Jimmy McGill gets to live.</p> <p>The last few episodes of Better Call Saul have seen creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould throw as much into every moment as they could and this finale was no different. Flashbacks with not just Walter White and Mike Ehrmantraut but Chuck McGill? You got it. Little recherché call backs – from the courtroom exit sign to copies of HG Wells’ Time Machine? There you go. Marie Schrader for all those Marie Schrader fans out there? Why not. And then, of course, we got Kim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"893bb7b5d9fcfd5586593fa3975e445c7d72d783\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/893bb7b5d9fcfd5586593fa3975e445c7d72d783/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Better days … Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut, Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Better days … Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut, Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final scene of the show, I’m going to argue, is what we were all hoping for. Granted Jimmy and Kim don’t get back together, they don’t have a chance to build a new life together, but there is redemption for them both and a rekindling of their love, something embodied in one final shared cigarette and the throb of its glowing tip (yes that’s innuendo, and I’m pretty sure the two of them shared a racy thought or two in that moment as well).</p> <p>After Gene is caught by Nebraska police fishing for diamonds in a dumpster, the twist this week is simple: we suddenly think that Saul is ready to betray Kim. He’s bartered down a potential life plus 190 sentence to seven years or so, but in his determination to ensure artisanal ice-cream he wants to share information on his ex-wife too. Word reaches Kim in Florida that a betrayal is in the offing and, so, she is there for Saul’s trial day to see precisely what happens.</p> <p>Saul, with Bill Oakley in tow, has landed some of the most lenient sentencing Judge Samantha Small has ever seen. In his flashiest suit and his smuggest expression, Saul looks set to try to squeeze the process even more as he embarks on a speech he has already given the feds. Except, then, he doesn’t. After an oleaginous introduction of the sort we have seen from Saul before, he switches up and comes clean. He chose to work with Walter White, he says, because he saw the opportunity to get rich. He never actually pulled a trigger or added any blue colouring but his fingerprints were all over the Heisenberg project. “I was indispensable and I made millions,” he says, in a final egotistical flourish.</p> <p>Just like Nacho and Howard before him, Saul has his final confessional speech, and in a way he also dies at the end of it. In sacrificing his liberty, Jimmy McGill reclaims his identity. More than that, he reclaims the respect of Kim Wexler, skulking at the back of the room. The pair make long lingering eye contact as he waits to be removed from court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"875b77b3ca1fea38fa89c3e03d8d830c26568944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/875b77b3ca1fea38fa89c3e03d8d830c26568944/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reclaimed respect … Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reclaimed respect … Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From there to jail, and the specific prison Saul wanted to avoid. It’s a place of big bad cons with plasters on their faces. They also happen to be the type of people who admire the legend of the crooked Albuquerque lawyer. So while Jimmy is back, perhaps inevitably Saul Goodman lives on too. And there’s a bit of Gene Takavic as well, toiling away in the prison bakery until he is summoned to meet his lawyer, who is in fact Kim, with a solitary cigarette and a dusky look in her eyes.</p> <p>They talk only a little, she admiring his plea bargaining, him joking about getting his sentence commuted to only a few decades for good behaviour. There is quiet and a distinct sense of contentment on Jimmy’s face. Then Kim leaves and it’s more difficult to read her thoughts as she waits to be taken out of the compound. Jimmy is there in the yard watching, and he catches her attention, giving her a Saul salute, two smoking finger guns. It’s kind of pathetic but self-effacing too. She gives him no response, but it’s not clear he needed one.</p> <h2>Summing up</h2> <p>There was a smart comment last week which observed that I’ve written a bit about the “morality” of this show, or at least argued that there is one, and that maybe I was simplifying matters a bit by suggesting there was something as distinct as good and bad in this dramatic world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bfed2c80ae68e1edda658f0b5a687c9a060aa98f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfed2c80ae68e1edda658f0b5a687c9a060aa98f/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Final redemption … Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Final redemption … Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That criticism is probably fair, especially in terms of the characters who carry good and bad within them in ways that are irresolvable (something brought out in each of the three flashbacks in this episode). However, as Better Call Saul ends I think we can say that there is such a thing as good and bad decisions that these characters can take and that doing the right thing, or the wrong thing, always has consequences. The final choice Jimmy makes is a moral one, whether to face up to his crimes or not, and he chooses good over evil. This means that, like Kim, while he suffers the consequences of his actions, he will at least no longer have to hide from them, or himself.</p> <p>The time machine question – or in Walt’s sneering dissection the one about “regrets” – is ultimately answered by Jimmy. He regrets losing Kim. He ultimately chooses to act in a way that does the best he can to make up for it. The counterpoint with Mike and Walter and Chuck was interesting though. Did those three ever do the same? (In fact, did Chuck ever acknowledge any regrets at all?)</p> <p>So a superlative series comes to an end and, like many I imagine, I hope we never get another instalment. The precision of the plotting, of the character development, has been spot on over the course of six seasons and the satisfaction of watching has been such that I wouldn’t ever want anything else to undo it. No Obi-Wan Kenobi in Albuquerque mini-series for me please.</p> <p>There are lots of details I will have missed from this episode, both big and small, and one of the delights of doing these recaps has been to watch the collective act of pulling them all together in the comments. So before we go I’d like to say thanks for reading, thanks for commenting, and my favourite character is Lalo Salamanca.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/16/penguin-cuts-off-meal-prep-king-cook-after-misogynistic-rant","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T17:55:17Z","webTitle":"Penguin cuts off Meal Prep King cook after misogynistic rant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/16/penguin-cuts-off-meal-prep-king-cook-after-misogynistic-rant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/16/penguin-cuts-off-meal-prep-king-cook-after-misogynistic-rant","fields":{"headline":"Penguin cuts off Meal Prep King cook after misogynistic rant","trailText":"Cookbook fans ‘heartbroken’ after John Clark’s derogatory outburst on social media","byline":"Lucy Knight","body":"<p>The cookbook author known as the Meal Prep King will no longer be published by Penguin Random House after he posted a misogynistic video on social media.</p> <p>John Clark, whose book The Meal Prep King Plan was a Sunday Times bestseller, repeatedly referred to women as “fucking scruffy cunts” during an Instagram live on Monday night, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chloejayde_/status/1559262389060739076\">according to a clip shared on social media</a>.</p> <p>“I do kind of like pissing women off,” the Bolton-based writer and lifestyle influencer said during the live stream.

The news agency said it was the highest proportion in records dating back to 2015.</p> <p>The disruption includes repeated strikes, severe weather conditions and Covid-related staff absences. Cancellations have surged in recent weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/13/rail-strikes-train-drivers-uk-disruption-aslef\">strike action over jobs, pay and conditions</a>.</p> <p>Avanti West Coast cancelled 16.2% of its services in the latest four-week period between 26 June and 23 July.

I write whatever there is to write,”</a> Rushdie told an Indian magazine before the novel’s publication, in an interview in which he plainly understood the furies that the book would unleash. It was banned first in India and in much of the Middle East. The writer was forced into hiding for more than a decade. But that ordeal never changed his view that artists had the right to offend and to seed “<a href=\"https://granta.com/outside-the-whale/\" title=\"\">the unceasing storm, the continual quarrel, the dialectic of history</a>”.</p> <p>The Satanic Verses is laced with often comic magical realism. Iran’s supreme leader is parodied in the novel as an imam grown so monstrous that he eats his own revolution. So what? No piece of writing deserves a death sentence or should be met with the threat of assault. The fatwa has never been revoked, but the threat had receded. And then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/12/salman-rushdie-attacked-onstage-new-york\" title=\"\">Friday’s attack</a>. This was a monstrous act of violence that should be unequivocally condemned. That the author had been preparing to give a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/nyregion/salman-rushdie-attacked.html\" title=\"\">talk</a> about the United States as a safe haven for exiled writers only underlines how precious is the right to free thought – and why it should be defended.</p> <p>Rushdie’s alleged attacker was not Iranian, but <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/residents-rushdie-suspects-lebanese-village-say-incident-has-little-do-with-them-2022-08-15/\" title=\"\">born</a> in the US to Lebanese Shia Muslim parents. By all accounts, Rushdie will live but may be badly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/08/14/1117437519/salman-rushdie-condition-stabbing-recovery?t=1660666072839\" title=\"\">maimed</a>. Writers can be questioned about why they chose the words they did or chose to frame their ideas in the way they did. They can be criticised for being far removed from the subjects they mock – or challenge. However, when writers face violent <a href=\"https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/bloodied-pen-salman-rushdie-and-the-violence-on-free-thought/cid/1880060?fbclid=IwAR3mnXZUuWcOD0FZq4uSPXmaJcNZTSnigFZNTimP-2GfMmeoiIAj4VC4LAw\" title=\"\">intimidation</a> from states or their proxies, or deluded followers of religious orthodoxies, they deserve our wholehearted support. There can only be solidarity with those being menaced. As Ben Okri <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/authors-on-the-salman-rushie-attack-a-society-cannot-survive-without-free-speech\" title=\"\">wrote:</a> “Democracy is built on the right to dissent, on the right for people to hold opposing positions.”</p> <p>As Rushdie recovers, the world has an opportunity to revisit the essential messages of his work. In exploring the migrant experience, rejecting fundamentalisms and dealing with race, he <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/salman-rushdie-and-the-power-of-words\" title=\"\">blazed</a> a trail for a generation of younger writers. His greatest book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/apr/03/salman-rushdie-on-midnights-children-at-40-india-is-no-longer-the-country-of-this-novel\" title=\"\">Midnight’s Children</a>, sparked a revolution in writing about India in English from an Indian point of view. He saw writers as offering a rival version of history to that peddled by politicians. Both, he <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v04/n18/salman-rushdie/imaginary-homelands\" title=\"\">wrote</a> in 1982, “try to make the world in their own images; they fight for the same territory. And the novel is one way of denying the official, politicians’ version of the truth.”</p> <p>The events of the past week are a reminder that the text of The Satanic Verses remains the same, but the context keeps changing. Rushdie’s work should be seen against the rise of an aggressive and polarising politics that draws on a singular race, religion or history to set the “nation” apart. Rushdie repudiated the idea that “intermingling with a different culture will inevitably weaken and ruin” one’s own. Instead the celebration of “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-defied-those-who-would-silence-him-too-many-fear-causing-offence\" title=\"\">hybridity</a>” and “impurity” of peoples runs through almost every book Rushdie has written. Stories can be twisted in the service of religious or political absolutism, but Rushdie showed that they are also powerful weapons in the hands of those seeking to refute such oppressive ways of seeing the world.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/16/the-guardian-view-on-polio-we-have-the-tools-to-tackle-this-old-enemy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T17:48:34Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on polio: we have the tools to tackle this old enemy | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/the-guardian-view-on-polio-we-have-the-tools-to-tackle-this-old-enemy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/the-guardian-view-on-polio-we-have-the-tools-to-tackle-this-old-enemy","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on polio: we have the tools to tackle this old enemy","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> The emergence of cases in the UK, US and elsewhere is a warning that the progress made in curbing the disease must be protected","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>More than six decades on, it is hard to imagine the joy and relief that greeted news of the polio vaccine.

The very success of vaccination means that – without the terrifying sight of <a href=\"https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/iron-lung\" title=\"\">children in iron lungs</a> – the danger has seemed largely remote and theoretical, rather than real and current. General vaccine hesitancy or opposition has also been a growing problem.</p> <p>The risks are much greater in parts of the developing world. This spring, Pakistan confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/25/spectre-of-polio-returns-to-haunt-pakistan-as-baby-boy-is-left-paralysed\" title=\"\">its first case of polio for more than a year</a>, and Mozambique <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/mozambique-polio-wild-poliovirus-case-malawi\" title=\"\">confirmed its first wild (but imported) polio case</a> in 30 years, after Malawi detected a similar strain in February. The pandemic disrupted immunisation programmes already challenged by war and other instability – compounding the relative lack of progress made over the last decade. The World Health Organization and Unicef, which hoped that 2021 would be a year of recovery, recently <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/15-07-2022-covid-19-pandemic-fuels-largest-continued-backslide-in-vaccinations-in-three-decades\" title=\"\">warned</a> instead of the largest sustained decline in childhood vaccination programmes for about 30 years, with 6.7 million more missing their third dose of polio vaccine than in 2019. Twenty-five million children missed out on one or more doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, and first-dose measles coverage dropped to the lowest level since 2008. This comes as soaring food prices exacerbate rising rates of severe malnutrition, weakening children’s immunity. And Covid-19 disinformation has bolstered anti-vaccine narratives.</p> <p>Assuring people that the polio vaccine is not only effective and safe but very well-established is important – as is reminding them that old foes as well as new can seriously threaten our health. So is facilitating immunisation: reminding busy parents when vaccines are available or due, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/diseases-polio-uk-global-vaccine-funding-monkeypox\" title=\"\">making them more easily accessible</a>, perhaps by offering them at community centres or schools. Protecting the UK also depends on efforts elsewhere. Shamefully, Britain has <a href=\"https://polioeradication.org/news-post/gpei-statement-on-the-uk-aid-cuts/\" title=\"\">slashed its funding</a> for the global eradication campaign, which needs $4.6bn. Covid made familiar the axiom that no one is safe until everyone is safe. That applies to old but persistent threats too.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/16/besiktas-want-to-take-struggling-dele-alli-from-everton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T17:37:16Z","webTitle":"Besiktas prepare to offer Dele Alli way out after Everton struggles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/besiktas-want-to-take-struggling-dele-alli-from-everton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/16/besiktas-want-to-take-struggling-dele-alli-from-everton","fields":{"headline":"Besiktas prepare to offer Dele Alli way out after Everton struggles","trailText":"Dele Alli could get the chance to revive his career in Turkey, with Besiktas keen to sign him from Everton","byline":"Jacob Steinberg","body":"<p>Besiktas are pushing to sign Dele Alli from Everton, who are unlikely to stand in the attacker’s way if he decides that he wants to leave the club this month.</p> <p>Alli has struggled since joining Everton from Tottenham in January, failing to score once in 13 appearances for the Goodison Park club, and he could be set for his second move this year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/everton-reject-45m-bid-from-chelsea-for-anthony-gordon\">Everton reject £45m bid from Chelsea for Anthony Gordon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 26-year-old has failed to establish himself as a regular starter under Frank Lampard and he is weighing up whether heading to Turkey would give him a chance to revive his career.</p> <p>It is a mark of Alli’s decline in the last three years that Everton are prepared to send him to Besiktas, who are open to either a loan or a permanent deal.

Eventually I got it – Cleveland Way, five points, a deep pride in being a student who knew the name of long distance walking routes – but production was delayed while he read out the question a second time and the cameras could film me tapping it in without the swearing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/16/jeremy-paxman-step-down-university-challenge-host\">Jeremy Paxman to step down as University Challenge host</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyone who has been on University Challenge will immediately be asked what it was like to be around Paxman. This is a man whose public persona is still defined by him repeating the same question 12 times during a 1997 interview with Michael Howard. Friends and family want war stories of Paxman’s barbs and rudeness. They want to hear, for some reason, how you were emotionally crushed by being in the sheer presence of the man.</p> <p>The reality can disappoint them. As a student taking part in the show you are the well-looked-after human meat on a perfectly delightful quiz show production line. Episodes are filmed back-to-back, with short gaps for Paxman to change his jacket to stop viewers at home thinking he’d been sleeping in the same suit for weeks. Direct contact with the presenter consisted of a stilted chat before the first episode – while keeping out of the way of the Jeremy Kyle show which was being filmed in the studio next door.</p> <p>Paxman is not going to be your mate and he might play up to his character by dismissively shaking his head when you fail to answer some supposedly obvious question. At best he’d be quietly encouraging. At worst, you were left with the impression that he really thought he’d do something more with his life than read out questions from cards.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwVsGO6-BWc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qwVsGO6-BWc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Jim Waterson and his team on University Challenge.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As my friend Tom Whyman, a writer and academic who also appeared on University Challenge, puts it: “It’s not like he was all warmth and smiles. But he’s not a quizzer himself and the truth is that if you did well he was honestly really impressed. The mystique dissolves as soon as you’re finished filming your first episode and he has to be filmed repeating questions because he’s mispronounced one of the words.”</p> <p>The new presenter will bring their own approach to University Challenge. Abrasive behaviour by television quizmasters is less fashionable now, with chummy chat preferred to eye-rolling at teenagers. There’s also an opportunity to subtly tweak the programme – such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/09/the-oxbridge-problem-is-it-time-to-shake-up-university-challenge\">updating which institutions are selected</a>.

These felt like legitimate reasons for sidestepping difficult questions or simply confessing I didn’t have an answer (although I wish I’d tried harder to find someone who did).</p> <p>I also lacked the life experience to truly appreciate why such conversations mattered. I did not have children. My parents were youthful and my loved ones healthy. My friends played golf, watched plays and ate at fancy restaurants. I lived in a privileged and infinitely optimistic world in which “morbidity and mortality” was just the name of a monthly meeting.</p> <p>But in the second half of my career, mortality and morbidity became part of my life. I found myself not only treating the “human condition” but also becoming a part of all that it entailed.</p> <p>Today, I have children whose love warms me and whose vulnerability sobers me. My parents have health scares and need help. My colleagues commit suicide and friends develop serious illness. Birthdays are interspersed with funerals; weddings with separations. Suddenly, no one is invincible – but no one really teaches this to doctors.</p> <p>Diagnosis, prognosis and everything in between have become real in their implications. Life expectancy isn’t “just an estimate” but a pronouncement that shifts weddings and barmitzvahs. Quality of life isn’t an academic footnote but a metric full of meaning. “If you were unable to speak for yourself, what would you want?” is not only a question for my patients but also one for my family.</p> <p>Of course, patients didn’t just start caring about their children and grandchildren. Or start resenting illness or rage against dying. These are age-old phenomena that now pulsate with new meaning because I am older. This shared experience of life is what draws doctors and patients closer. It is also what makes difficult conversations harder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/10/why-a-good-funeral-can-be-a-life-affirming-occasion\">Why a good funeral can be a life-affirming occasion | Eva Wiseman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I walk back in, my patient looks at me expectantly.

When her grandmother died over a decade ago in Cape Town, she kept a lock of her “striking, platinum” hair to remember her by – a memento she would rush to save in a fire.

My dear Aunty Ruth made it happen, bless her. That silvery snippet is a heartwarming and tactile reminder of Violet. It is a keepsake to admire and adore. Her hair is tied with some apple-green ribbon and lives in a velvet, burgundy jewellery box. It’s rather venerable-looking, vintage and very precious.

Meanwhile, a storm could shift the sand on the ocean floor, exposing more wood to animals and the elements.</p> <p>Dr James Hunter, the museum’s curator of naval heritage and archaeology, said many people think about looters when they hear about the need to protect shipwreck sites.</p> <p>“That’s an immediate concern and one that’s legitimate, but the natural processes can get overlooked,” he said.</p> <p>“You have issues with shipworm and with gribbles [and] fish; I’ve watched fish chew on timber.</p> <p>“They feed on just about anything, and what they’re trying to get out is worms and snails and whatever happens to be in the wood.”</p> <p>Kieran Hosty, the museum’s maritime archaeology manager, said the threats were “nothing new” and that wrecks had “no chance” if timber was above the sea bed and in temperate waters.</p> <p>“We have encountered shipworms before on all the timber sites in Rhode Island,” he said.</p> <p>“If the Endeavour is left exposed, there’s a continued threat to the site.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/04/magnificent-jellyfish-found-off-coast-of-papua-new-guinea-sparks-interest-among-researchers\">‘Magnificent’ jellyfish found off coast of Papua New Guinea sparks interest among researchers </a> </p> </aside>  <p>While there’s a chance storms could expose more of the wreck, he said, it was also possible they could return to the site and find it entirely buried and therefore protected.</p> <p>But there are also ways humans can stop the damage.</p> <p>Hunter said any parts that were buried were “deoxygenated”, so nothing could get at them. It’s also possible to use a “geotextile” – similar to a shade cloth – to keep the worms out.</p> <p>Hosty said the easiest and cheapest way is sandbagging the site, using sand from the local environment.</p> <p>“[Or] you can have sand pumped on to the site. In more extreme circumstances, you can use artificial seaweed – basically a [neoprene] seaweed frond on a mesh base – which attracts sand as it goes past,” he said.</p> <p>“We’ve used all these techniques successfully.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a

Win and the double chance is yours. Lose, and you might face Tom Lynch and a resurgent Richmond in an elimination final.</p> <p>The reigning premiers have struggled to maintain momentum through the back half of the year, following each win with a loss since July. Prior to that, they smoked Brisbane by more than 10 goals at the MCG on a Thursday night in June.</p> <p>The Lions at the Gabba are a very different proposition. Having won four of their past five, Brisbane go in as slight favourites, although another rare quiet night from Lachie Neale against the league’s best midfield will make things considerably more difficult.</p> <h2><strong>Carlton v Collingwood</strong></h2> <p>On Sunday, Carlton plays Collingwood, who up until last weekend took to winning like an Irish poet to rhyme. It is the first game of consequence between the two sides since 1988’s qualifying final. Back then the hate each club had for the other was the very spring of thought and action.

And considering Marcus Bontempelli’s adductor muscles and their record against the Hawks in Tasmania, is an outcome only the most pessimistic Blue would dismiss out of hand.</p> <p>While the consequences may appear to be not as great for Collingwood (although a win would give them the double chance) the Magpies have retained a hair-trigger sense of grievance over the Blues. One, that if Collingwood’s past two months serve as a guide, will be tested for most of the afternoon.</p> <p>A loss could also see Collingwood face a resurgent Richmond in an elimination final. In a list of adjectives likely to be ascribed to that scenario, “hopeful” would fall somewhere well below “terrified”.</p> <h2><strong>And then there’s Essendon…</strong></h2> <p>Richmond closes its home-and-away season on Saturday night against Essendon – a game that perhaps holds more interest than it did a few days ago, after the Bombers spent the first part of this week imploding like the crypto market, following a 14-goal loss to a middling Port Adelaide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25c7703b8dd23880d3b202ef4e24ce4845ca73f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c7703b8dd23880d3b202ef4e24ce4845ca73f8/0_0_5782_3855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Rutten departs from the Hangar in Melbourne on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Rutten departs from the Hangar in Melbourne on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diego Fedele/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indignant Bomber supporters wanted the boss to go down.

Some bookshops place its red dirt cover in crime. Others in literary fiction. Some have called it a gothic thriller. It doesn’t really matter where it goes, such is the arresting nature of its content.</p> <p>It was the sixth manuscript in three years for the young author, James McKenzie Watson. He knew Denizen was dark, but he wrote it for himself. He had begun writing as a form of therapy because he was a troubled child.</p> <p>Then it won the Penguin Literary prize in 2021 for new Australian authors and it became clear this deeply personal story resonated with others.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/18/dubbo-championship-wrestling-review-musical-doesnt-quite-land-the-smackdown\">Dubbo Championship Wrestling review – musical doesn’t quite land the smackdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McKenzie Watson lives in Dubbo in regional New South Wales, where he works as a nurse in oncology, but he is also trained in emergency nursing. The 29-year-old grew up about 150km away in the country town of Coonabarabran. He struggled at school and describes his childhood self as a sensitive boy who could not find his tribe.</p> <p>In Denizen, he has created Parker, a nine-year-old boy in a country town. Parker fights with his parents, his school and himself. He suspects there is something wrong with his brain.</p> <p>The book opens with Parker as a new father – an experience that sends him on a well-worn path back to his childhood. That emotional journey coincides with a camping trip back in his home town with old friends.</p> <p>There begins a cleverly written story that reads like an emotional autopsy, shining light on the big issues: mental health, parenthood, inequity and Australia’s enduring rural myths.</p> <p>Like life, Denizen is contradictory; equal parts savage and empathic.</p> <p>“I think the emotional truth at the core of Denizen was that I felt very, very acutely as a child and teenager and I didn’t know how to sit with that. And I felt that there was something very wrong with me in terms of how intensely I felt,” McKenzie Watson says.</p> <p>“I look back at that and realise it’s not normal for a nine-year-old to feel so intensely that they want to die as opposed to continuing to live.”</p> <p>James describes his own mental health without flinching. He was a “destructive and self-harming teenager”. He felt as if he was in pain most of the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"46003c78d5f726e0b63ee8082ca08df3299aad0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46003c78d5f726e0b63ee8082ca08df3299aad0b/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James McKenzie Watson, a Dubbo based nurse and winner of the Penguin Literary Award 2021 for an unpublished manuscript.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I think I probably would have died if I stayed in the bush much longer.

In a town of 2,000 or so, it was hard to find mental health support and this is one of the themes he hopes readers take away from Denizen. As a result of that lack of support, his mother, father and brother bore the brunt of his behaviour.</p> <p>“It must have been harrowing for my family to go through because they love me so intensely and could see that I was just actually on the brink of self-destruction.</p> <p>“And I think the guilt and shame that I feel about how much I put them through is where the emotional authenticity and the plot of Denizen comes from, even though the specifics of the narrative are entirely different.”</p> <p>During a telehealth consultation, a psychiatrist made the pivotal suggestion to check into a mental health unit six hours away in Sydney. The teenager recognised it might be the circuit breaker he needed to begin recovery. He moved three months later.</p> <p>“I think I probably would have died if I stayed in the bush much longer. I am sure that is true for a lot of people.”</p> <p>He says the treatment worked, but there were a “rocky” few years after that. While he was recovering, he lacked direction and it was a mental health nurse, who was also a talented musician, who suggested nursing might be a good way to support McKenzie Watson while he pursued creative work.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/14/sign-up-for-rural-network-guardian-australia-email-newsletter-about-regional-affairs?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\">  <iframe id=\"the-rural-network\" name=\"the-rural-network\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-rural-network\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-rural-network\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Given his history, it may seem odd that McKenzie Watson has returned to a country town.

The polling found 71% of Conservative voters said a windfall tax on energy companies should be used to fund the extra support measures.</p> <p>Speaking prior to the hustings event in Perth on Tuesday, Truss said her focus on tax cuts was the best approach to the energy cost crisis, arguing that proposalssuch as those from Labour represented “sticking plasters”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-16-11:48:58/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-16-11:48:58/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Truss has previously ruled out a more wide-reaching windfall tax, although Treasury officials have drawn up some options to extend the current tax announced by Sunak as chancellor in May.</p> <p>Brown said that there should be further support in the package for those already in crisis because of the current rising bills, who would still suffer this winter even with a price freeze.</p> <p>Of those polled, 50% say more support should be offered to those on lower incomes and 40% say everyone should get extra help.

Unlikely because the book, set in Montana, was a first novel by a British television producer, and landmark because the book sold for a record price at auction, and justified its sale price.</p> <p>Evans had previously left a successful position as number two to Melvyn Bragg on the South Bank Show, where he produced many of the flagship programmes of the television arts series, including profiles of Patricia Highsmith, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/14/john-le-carre-obituary\" title=\"\">John Le Carré</a>, Laurence Olivier, Francis Bacon and, most crucially, the film director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/04/features\" title=\"\">David Lean</a>, who became a friend and wondered why Evans was making a film about him, and not something he wanted to do for himself.</p> <p>Evans then co-produced and wrote a TV film, Murder By the Book (1987), about Agatha Christie and her character Hercule Poirot, played by Peggy Ashcroft and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/19/sir-ian-holm-obituary\" title=\"\">Ian Holm</a>.

Evans had gone to the US, to meet men who did this, thinking the story needed a western setting. “If you set a book in postwar or contemporary Britain, something shrinks,” he said. “It becomes parochial.”</p> <p>He gave the manuscript of the book, half-finished with an outline of the remainder, to his friend the agent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/27/caradoc-king-interview-problem-child\" title=\"\">Caradoc King</a>, who took it to the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/frankfurt-book-fair\" title=\"\">Frankfurt book fair</a>, where it instigated a bidding war.</p> <p>Dell bought the US rights for $3.15m, Bantam got UK rights for $537,000 and translation deals in Germany and Italy netted another million dollars. The film rights went to Robert Redford for another $3m because Evans saw Redford in the role of his hero, Tom Booker.</p> <p>While this was happening, his melanoma was removed by surgery and his local bank manager, who had been demanding repayment of his overdraft, called and invited him to lunch.</p> <p>The novel got mixed reviews, especially in the US. Virtually no critic could resist mentioning Evans’ advances; many also drew comparison with Robert James Waller’s The Bridges of Madison County. Evans himself acknowledged the influences of Cormac McCarthy, Ernest Hemingway and Jack London. The New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani called it “a sappy romance novel, gussied up with some sentimental claptrap about the emotional life of animals and lots of Walleresque hooey about men and women”.</p> <p>But it shot to the top of the New York Times’ bestseller list, ranked No15 for the year despite being released in the autumn, and remains one of the bestselling novels of all time. Redford’s 1998 film, which starred the 14-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\" title=\"\">Scarlett Johansson</a> as Grace, the teenager injured along with her prize horse, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kristin-scott-thomas\" title=\"\">Kristin Scott Thomas</a> as her mother, who seeks out Redford’s Booker, and has an affair with him, did well but was not a huge hit.</p> <p>Evans was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, the son of Anthony, the sales director of a motor engineering company, and Eileen (nee Whitehouse). He was head boy at Bromsgrove school, and after a year teaching in Senegal for Voluntary Service Overseas, went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford to study law, where he met Jenny Lyon, his future wife, in their first week.</p> <p>After taking a first-class degree, he started work as a journalist for the Evening Chronicle in Newcastle. In 1975, he started at London Weekend Television, first on Weekend World and then the London Programme, the broadcaster’s top current affairs show, before joining the South Bank Show as executive producer from 1982 to 1984.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7146ccff69297bc65af56343153e98cfa6a0ef04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7146ccff69297bc65af56343153e98cfa6a0ef04/0_223_2916_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Redford and Scarlett Johansson in the 1998 film The Horse Whisperer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Redford and Scarlett Johansson in the 1998 film The Horse Whisperer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buena Vista/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Murder By the Book, he adapted screenplays for the TV movies Acts of Betrayal (1988), about the IRA, and Secret Weapon (1990), the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mordechai-vanunu\" title=\"\">Mordechai Vanunu</a>, the nuclear bomb whistleblower kidnapped by the Israelis and imprisoned for treason, and for the Julie Walters film Just Like a Woman (1992), based on Monica Jay’s novel about a transvestite’s romance with his landlady.</p> <p>His second novel, The Loop (1998), brought a wolf biologist, Helen Ross, from Cape Cod into Yellowstone Park to cope with the reintroduction of wolves; pursued by a local lothario, she instead romances his 18-year-old son and cures his stutter. It sold 5m copies.</p> <p>He followed this up with The Smoke Jumper (2001), whose titular protagonist is in love with his best friend’s wife, and who exiles himself as a war photographer. Next came The Divide (2005), about a wealthy New York couple who holiday in Montana, where the body of their eco-terrorist daughter is discovered frozen in the mountain ice.</p> <p>Evans and Jenny divorced in 1998. He then married the singer-songwriter Charlotte Gordon Cumming. In 2008, while on a visit to Gordon Cumming’s brother’s estate in Scotland, Evans picked mushrooms for a family lunch. What he thought were ceps were instead highly poisonous webcaps. Evans, Gordon Cumming and her brother were all placed on kidney dialysis. Three years later, Evans’ heart began to suffer under the strain of dialysis, and his daughter Lauren provided him with a kidney; Gordon Cumming later received one donated from a friend.</p> <p>At the time of the poisoning, Evans had almost finished his fifth novel, The Brave (2009), about a family’s hidden secrets.</p> <p>When he began writing again, thinking for the second time he needed to finish writing before he died, he said the book changed direction. “I found new empathy with the characters ... it became more emotional,” he said.

Their visit – led by Massachusetts senator Ed Markey – took place less than two weeks after the visit by the US House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that prompted China to conduct days of unprecedented live-fire exercises.</p> <p>The veteran Chinese diplomat defended his government’s action, which drew condemnation from the UK. Zheng argued that it was “only natural that China takes necessary measures in response”. He accused the US and “‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces” of being the “perpetrators”, and said they “must bear full responsibility for their wrongdoings”.</p> <p>Calls to support Taiwan have been on the rise in recent years as China’s relations with western democracies deteriorate. Last week Truss said China’s actions “threaten peace and stability in the region”.

The UK has its own version of “one-China policy”, which means that it does not have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</p> <p>“This history must never be forgotten and pledges should be honoured,” Zheng urged, adding that Beijing’s “one-China principle” is the “political foundation for the development of relations between China and all countries in the world”.</p> <p>China and the UK began exchanging ambassadors in 1972, following the singing of a bilateral agreement.

We won’t look at it like that. The focus is all on us and how we are going to play, combating whatever they have with what we have, in our way.”</p> <p>South Africa have studied England’s performances during their run of four successive Test victories this summer. The conclusion is that theirs is a stronger side than those England previously faced, and better prepared for whatever Brendon McCullum’s charges can throw at them.</p> <p>“One of our biggest strengths as a Test side over this last period has been our awareness to adapt,” said Elgar, whose team have won seven of their past nine Tests. “I think that is going to be a massive factor for us in this series, especially if England do have a flyer. I know somewhere they are going to have periods in the game when they are on top of us, and we are going to have to find a way to adapt to that situation.</p> <p>“I think there has been a lot of learnings since watching those series unfold the way they did. I do think we are a smarter side and adaptability is extremely big for me.</p> <p>“Everyone has a good buy-in with regards to parking their personal stuff; to do what we require to slow down their batting, for instance. I would like to think from a bowling point of view, our bowlers are big, tall, fast and strong buggers.</p> <p>“I think we come in with a lot more resources. I’m not going to diss the opposition they played against, but I am purely speaking from a South African point of view. I think we have covered all bases and ticked all the boxes in the right kind of angle to curb those moments in the game.”</p> <p>With rain forecast on Wednesday South Africa will assess conditions and Kagiso Rabada’s fitness before naming their XI, while England change the side that defeated India at Edgbaston last month only by returning the gloves to Ben Foakes, who missed that game with Covid and replaces Sam Billings.</p> <p>Having rattled off successful fourth-innings run chases in all four games so far this summer, the one potential novelty will come if they are forced to bowl their way to victory. “If we’ve got 40 overs to bowl a team out on day five we’ll be doing everything we can to do that,” Stokes said. “We won’t just stick to the normal things. You’ll see us changing a lot of plans if we feel like something isn’t going to work. We’ll keep the same mindset with the ball as with the bat.”</p> <p>The Marylebone Cricket Club announced on Tuesday that, should the Lord’s Test reach a fifth day on Sunday, all tickets will be available for a donation of £5, with proceeds split between two charities: the Ruth Strauss Foundation and the MCC Foundation.

But Prof Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has suggested it is unlikely to be used in the future.</p> <p>“It was a fantastic vaccine, and it still is a fantastic vaccine for the world … and the population which received AstraZeneca vaccines of course got very good protection from it,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday. “But the way that the taskforce has decided to purchase the vaccines, we are using mRNA vaccines now.”</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) confirmed to the Guardian that it had not placed further orders for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and said the decision was down to a recommendation by the JCVI that mRNA vaccines – such as the Pfizer or Moderna jabs – should primarily be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-statement-september-2021-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-for-winter-2021-to-2022/jcvi-statement-regarding-a-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-for-winter-2021-to-2022\">used for boosters</a>.</p> <p>“The results of the Cov-Boost trial conducted during the summer of 2021 provided good evidence that mRNA vaccines are the most effective option for the UK’s booster programme,” a JCVI spokesperson said, noting that the jabs provided a very good immune response regardless of which vaccine was used for previous doses.</p> <p>“Real-world data of vaccine effectiveness following the rollout of the booster programme support the results from the Cov-Boost trial,” they said.</p> <p>While the JCVI has previously advised booster shots with the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab can occur in exceptional circumstances, the DHSC has now procured supplies of the Novavax vaccine – <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-nuvaxovid-approved-by-mhra#:~:text=The%20vaccine%20has%20been%20approved,safety%2C%20quality%20and%20effectiveness%20standards.&amp;text=Nuvaxovid%2C%20the%20COVID%2D19%20vaccine,products%20Regulatory%20Agency%20(MHRA).\">approved by the MHRA in February</a> – which the JCVI has recommended should be offered to people who cannot have mRNA vaccines for clinical reasons, such as allergic reactions.</p> <p>The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has had a bumpy ride since its first results were released in 2020, including concerns over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/02/covid-scientists-blood-clots-astrazeneca-covid-jab-vaccine-side-effects-pandemic\">rare blood clot complications</a>, misinformation – such as claims the jab has low efficacy in elderly people – and criticisms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/20/oxford-covid-jab-vaccine-astrazeneca\">over the design of the vaccine’s trials</a>.</p> <p>Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a member of the JCVI, said the committee could only advise on the deployment of vaccines that the government had decided to buy.</p> <p>He said an abundance of caution over the issue of blood clots in younger people was one reason the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab was not deemed suitable for the booster programme, along with public perception of the vaccine.</p> <p>“Obviously, the whole success of the vaccine programme hinges on there being a public buy-in to accepting the vaccine,” he said.</p> <p>The jab was also unlikely to be used for first and second doses, he suggested. “I think primary immunisation [has] pretty much stopped now, in the sense that anyone who wants a vaccine by now will have had it,” Finn said.</p> <p>In addition, the DHSC noted that those who cannot have an mRNA jab for their primary course could now be offered the Novavax vaccine.</p> <p>Simplicity matters, Finn suggested. “Operationally, the fewer vaccines you’ve got, the easier the communication, the easier the logistics,” he said, adding that this also goes for the autumn booster campaign.</p> <p>“The ideal scenario … would be to deploy the new Moderna bivalent vaccine – just give it to everybody eligible for a booster and just have one vaccine that everyone gets,” he said. “It’s just that we don’t really know yet whether we can match supply and demand to do that.”</p> <p>But Harnden told the Guardian that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine still had an important role to play in tackling Covid worldwide, noting that the UK had donated doses to the Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme.</p> <p>“[The jab] is a very effective vaccine that doesn’t have the same storage and transport issues that the mRNA vaccines have. So [it] is a very good vaccine for developing world where the temperature requirements can be more problematic,” he said. “JCVI are making recommendations on the choice of vaccines in the context of UK supply.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
