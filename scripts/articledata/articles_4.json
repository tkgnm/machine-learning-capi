But Fish Legal has asked for a formal hearing to challenge the attempt to abstract more water. The campaigning legal group says the company has not done enough to reduce water usage by customers or come up with a way to protect fish populations in the river before resorting to a drought permit.</p> <p>Southern became the first water company in England <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/29/southern-water-announces-hosepipe-ban-amid-uk-drought-fears\">to issue a hosepipe ban</a> last week in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. With other water companies, Southern contributes to water leakage of nearly 3bn litres a day from its pipes, although it says it is among the best in the country at tackling leaks. The company leaks approximately 88m litres of water a day.</p> <p>The company has submitted a drought permit application to the Environment Agency to allow it to continue abstracting water from the Test even if the river falls below an agreed minimum level, which has been set to protect the salmon population. </p> <p>Southern Water’s current licence allows it to take water from the Test as long as the flow does not drop to below 355m litres a day (mld), called the “hands-off flow” limit. This limit was set by the EA after a public inquiry in 2018. The utility company now want this level to be reduced temporarily to 265mld.</p> <p>Penelope Gane, head of practice at Fish Legal, said: “With a dry winter and spring, a drought was virtually inevitable this summer. Yet water usage in the area has actually gone up since October 2021, which suggests that the water company’s efforts to ‘manage demand’ have not been working.</p> <p>“Southern Water drought planning has not put the environment first. It is only belatedly that they have warned customers across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight that they intend to bring in a hosepipe ban.</p> <p>“That says that only in extremis and at the last minute will Southern Water take proactive measures to protect the environment, in this case a rare chalk stream that is a habitat for salmon, rather than just continue with business as usual.”</p> <p>Fish Legal says continued abstraction to below the current flow limit could seriously threaten the river’s ecology and fish populations, including Atlantic salmon and sea trout that are already being stressed due to low flows.</p> <p>Wild salmon is at critical levels in English rivers. A report by Defra last month shows that 74% of rivers in England are now “at risk” with wild salmon populations no longer at sustainable levels and threatened with irreversible decline or even extinction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrew Kelton, a solicitor for Fish Legal, said: “The drought permit will inevitably harm fish by reducing already extremely low, deoxygenated, warm water a great deal further and predictably leading to fish deaths. Southern Water have made some initial – and untested – plans for fish rescue and relocation, but I am not aware that this has ever been successfully done for migratory adult salmon.”</p> <p>Southern Water said regarding its application for a drought permit: “While in the process of applying for a drought permit, we urge and remind all customers in Hampshire to reduce water use wherever possible, to help us protect the impact on the river’s habitat.”</p> <p>Nick Price, water resources strategy manager at Southern Water, said: “With river flows dropping following a dry winter and spring, the risk is increasing that we will need to use a drought permit in order to continue supplying water. The less we take out of the River Test for water supply, the more we leave in it for wildlife and to support its precious habitats. We continue to ask customers to use water wisely.”</p> <p>The company says its aim is to reduce water leakage by 15% by 2025 and 40% by 2040.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/02/ba-restricts-sales-for-heathrow-short-haul-flights-for-rest-of-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T16:13:44Z","webTitle":"BA restricts sales for Heathrow short-haul flights for rest of summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/02/ba-restricts-sales-for-heathrow-short-haul-flights-for-rest-of-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/02/ba-restricts-sales-for-heathrow-short-haul-flights-for-rest-of-summer","fields":{"headline":"BA restricts sales for Heathrow short-haul flights for rest of summer","trailText":"Airline taking ‘responsible action’ in response to airport’s cap of 100,000 daily passengers","byline":"Gwyn Topham and Geneva Abdul","body":"<p>British Airways will restrict sales for short-haul flights from Heathrow all summer, with no more tickets for departures before 15 August, in an attempt to head off further disruption and flight cancellations.</p> <p>The unprecedented move by BA comes in response to the London airport’s cap on passengers, limiting total numbers to 100,000 a day, after staff shortages led to long queues, flight delays and problems with baggage earlier this year.</p> <p>The airline said it was taking “responsible action” which would build resilience, and that suspending its sales of seats to domestic and European destinations would also allow existing customers to re-book flights as needed.</p> <p>BA cancelled more than 10,000 summer flights last month but will not be removing any further departures from the schedule under the new plans, and no existing bookings will be affected.</p> <p>After 15 August, the airline plans to restrict sales “dynamically” rather than with a blanket ban, but expects to continue to limit available seats for busier days and periods throughout the summer. It said the measures would protect existing bookings and help manage any disruption due to other factors, such as adverse weather or air traffic restrictions.</p> <p>A British Airways spokesperson said: “We took pre-emptive action to reduce our schedule this summer to give customers certainty about their travel plans and to build more resilience into our operation, given the ongoing challenges facing the entire aviation industry.</p> <p>“When Heathrow introduced its passenger cap, we took a small number of additional flights from our schedule. And to continue to comply with the cap, we’ve been taking responsible action by limiting sales, or all the available fares, on some of our Heathrow services to ensure more seats are available to re-book customers.</p> <p>“We’ll continue to manage bookings to be within the Heathrow imposed cap so we can get our customers away as planned this summer.”</p> <p>Airlines and airports across Britain and Europe have struggled to cope with the rebound in travel after the pandemic, with many still unable to recruit enough staff, particularly in ground handling services such as check-in and baggage.</p> <p>Heathrow said it now has as many people employed in security as in 2019, and that 80% of passengers will clear security within 20 minutes or less. But Heathrow added that its airlines, which are responsible for hiring or contracting ground staff, do not have enough people to manage.</p> <p>It told airlines to limit the number of tickets they sell over the summer after it capped the number of passengers passing through the airport at 100,000 a day to limit queues. Another carrier, Emirates, which initially resisted the order, has now agreed to cap sales along with BA.</p> <p>Despite the cap, an average of more than 100,000 people a day have taken off over the first 10 days of the UK summer holidays, Heathrow said. Over 1 million people took flights in the airport’s busiest period for departures since Christmas 2019, with New York, Los Angeles and Dubai the main routes.</p> <p>Heathrow said the high proportion of occasional leisure travellers unfamiliar with the airport and current documentation requirements was slowing progress at check-in desks and security. Delays were caused by people ignoring rules banning liquids above 100ml in hand luggage, while airport queues were exacerbated by anxious passengers arriving more than three hours before departure, before check-ins had opened. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chief operating officer, Emma Gilthorpe, said Heathrow was keen to operate without a cap as soon as possible, but it would require airlines to have sufficient ground handling resources.</p> <p>She said: “The airport has struggled to cope as passenger volumes increased beyond the collective capacity of companies across the airport to serve them. This resulted in an unacceptable increase in delays to get planes on to stand, bags not travelling with passengers or being delivered very late to the baggage hall, low departure punctuality and some flights being cancelled after passengers had boarded.</p> <p>“The cap has slightly reduced passenger numbers, bringing them into line with available resources, and as a result, is already resulting in better, more reliable journeys for passengers.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/02/ajax-ban-shirt-requests-everton-metaverse","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T16:12:56Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Ajax ahead of the cardboard curve as Everton get lost in the metaverse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/ajax-ban-shirt-requests-everton-metaverse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/02/ajax-ban-shirt-requests-everton-metaverse","fields":{"headline":"Ajax ahead of the cardboard curve as Everton get lost in the metaverse","trailText":"<strong>In today’s Fiver: </strong>Ajax take a welcome stand, Richard Keys hops on the England bandwagon and Discomister’s time has come","byline":"Barry Glendenning","body":"<h2><strong>GETTING SHIRTY</strong></h2> <p>On and off the field of play, Ajax have long been renowned as innovators who are invariably ahead of the curve. The Dutch club are generally credited with the invention of “total football” during the 1970s, while their home ground employs no end of eco-initiatives that make it one of the most environmentally friendly, sustainable stadiums in the world. Where Ajax go, other clubs often follow and it is to be hoped, in the wake of today’s announcement that fans have been banned from carrying cardboard signs pleading for shirts off players’ backs, every single other football club on the planet will quickly follow suit.</p> <p>What began a couple of seasons ago as an innovative, faintly endearing wheeze from a couple of wide-eyed innocents in the crowd, has latterly been transformed into a widespread chiselling grift. So saturated has the demand for free “stuff” become, we have reached the point where it is no longer possible to sit beer in hand in front of the TV on a Super Sunday without having to bear witness to it. Dozens of entitled, grasping, young – and sometimes depressingly old – brats sitting close to the advertising hoardings and holding up twee, homemade cardboard rectangles bearing a written request for the soiled shirts from their favourite player’s back.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/pride-of-the-lionesses-englands-road-to-euro-2022-glory-in-pictures\">Pride of the Lionesses: England’s road to Euro 2022 glory – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ajax have reportedly told their supporters’ association that there is an increasing number of such signs at games, mostly being held by children, and it will no longer be possible for the players to accede to all the demands. They also suggested their players were getting fed up with being badgered and abused if they failed to spot or simply ignored these daubed requests. In order to avoid any potential loopholes that might involve requests for Davy Klaassen’s shorts, strides, socks, shinpads or boots, Ajax pointed out such signs also represent a fire hazard and any variations on the shirt-scrounging theme will be confiscated by stewards.</p> <p>If, as The Fiver hopes, all clubs follow Ajax’s pioneering lead, Everton fans will at least be able to console themselves with the news their club has devised a spanking new shirt distribution scheme. In a statement that might as well have been written in Klingon for all the sense we can make of it, the club has announced what looks suspiciously like a kit-related grift of their own. Launched in partnership with – Fiver considers the life choices which have led to us actually having to type these words – the digital wearables platform Fancurve, Everton will soon be releasing officially licensed, club-branded digitally wearable shirts.</p> <p>“These unique, photo-realistic custom collections – designed and created by Fancurve’s team of highly-skilled 3D fashion designers and using themes from the club’s identity and values as an inspiration – will empower fans to express their unrivalled passion for Everton by wearing them on their avatars in the Metaverse,” explains the blurb, stopping short of shedding light on what the Metaverse is for the benefit of your poor befuddled Fiver.</p> <p>While we are happy to be corrected by younger readers, our take on the situation is that it’s some sort of magic witch portal through which nerds travel to take refuge from their more mundane reality spent sitting in mum’s spare bedroom, wearing a sweat-stained Minecraft T-shirt sprinkled with Monster Munch crumbs. And what better way could there be to escape such a tedious reality than in a pristine virtual Everton shirt – one the club will naturally expect fans to pay for with as-yet-unspecified sums of real money.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“I was thrilled to bits for the Lionesses … I was quiet on this subject during the tournament because of all the usual nonsense that surrounds anything I have to say.

killing was a Biden play for popularity – but it may have unintended consequences","trailText":"The death of the al-Qaida leader points to a potential shift, says Chatham House associate fellow Hameed Hakimi","byline":"Hameed Hakimi","body":"<p>A decade after US Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden in a special operation in Pakistan, Ayman al-Zawahiri <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/us-strike-afghanistan-kills-al-qaida-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri\">was killed</a> in a US drone strike in Kabul.</p> <p>Both men were synonymous with the image of al-Qaida. But more than anything, the killing of Zawahiri is a symbolic success for Joe Biden, whose approval rating has been <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-approval-rating-gallup-poll-1729533\">dismally low</a> recently. Even before the ill-fated military withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to the Taliban seizing power, the US president had been vigorously trying to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/02/biden-july-4-jobs-report-afghanistan-497834\">avoid</a> discussing the country in his media engagements. Unsurprisingly, he is now trying to capitalise on the drone strike that killed Zawahiri to seek redemption in Afghanistan.</p> <p>While Zawahiri was involved in the planning of the 9/11 attacks, his more recent significance is more questionable. Al-Qaida may be one of the most notorious global jihadist groups since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but it has been competing in a crowded space of violent extremists including Islamic State – and its affiliates – in the Middle East, Asia and beyond. </p> <p>The death of Zawahiri will not transform the nature of any threat facing the US and Europe from Afghanistan under the Taliban. But it underlines how imperative it is to ensure Afghanistan does not become so unstable and forgotten that it provides a ground for the incubation of terrorism and violent jihadists. Groups such as al-Qaida, Islamic State and previously the Taliban are experts in replacing leaders in quick succession without interrupting operations.</p> <p>Crucially, Zawahiri’s killing unleashes several unknown consequences and political and security implications for different sides of the conflict in and around Afghanistan.</p> <p>For months there have been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bsarwary/status/1454483714961035265?s=20&amp;t=ZGdyiH7BAynSAYqQSf2tjw\">unconfirmed reports</a> of drones flying over the skies of Kabul. The Taliban have been presenting their regime as the first in decades to have total control over the Afghan territory. The US drone strike killing Zawahiri in Kabul’s Shirpur district – where some of the most <a href=\"https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/report/89191/afghanistan-mansions-amid-poverty\">ostentatious mansions</a> were built by former US-backed warlords – defeats the Taliban’s claims of having full territorial control. The US-Taliban <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Agreement-For-Bringing-Peace-to-Afghanistan-02.29.20.pdf\">agreement</a> signed in Doha in February 2020 states that the Taliban “will not allow any of its members, other individuals or groups, including al-Qaida, to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies”. Acknowledging Zawahiri’s presence in Kabul will set the Taliban against the US, but admitting a lack of intelligence will lead to accepting defeat in establishing control.</p> <p>As the Taliban are largely a loose union of different factions who were strongly united as an insurgency prior to August 2021, it is plausible that one or more factions among them were hosting and protecting Zawahiri. His death will put significant pressure on these internal fissures, especially if the US continues drone strikes in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Because Afghanistan is landlocked, the over-the-horizon operations by US drones would have needed permission from one of the neighbouring states to enter the Afghan airspace. Iran, central Asian countries and China – which shares a mountainous border with Afghanistan – would not cooperate with the US on this. Pakistan, therefore, would be the logical option. If this US strike was carried out in cooperation with Pakistan, there are several major regional implications. Pakistan has strong relations with China, including the multibillion-dollar infrastructural project, the <a href=\"http://cpec.gov.pk/\">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a> (CPEC). For nearly 20 years, Pakistan provided the Taliban sanctuary as the group waged a bloody insurgency against US, Nato and Afghan security forces that also killed tens of thousands of Afghan civilians. The former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/south-asia/taliban-pakistan-imran-khan-afghanistan-b1903821.html\">celebrated</a> the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021, and blamed the US for a heedless “<a href=\"https://www.georgewbushlibrary.gov/research/topic-guides/global-war-terror\">war on terror</a>”. But Khan was <a href=\"https://tribune.com.pk/story/2351683/imran-khan-becomes-first-premier-of-the-country-to-be-unseated-by-a-parliamentary-revolt\">unseated</a> in a no-confidence vote in April.</p> <p>Pakistani-American cooperation on counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan would underline a significant thawing of relations. It may impact Islamabad’s efforts to build further relations with China and Russia. However, Pakistan has been facing immense financial difficulties, with rising inflation and plummeting value of the local currency. Islamabad has been <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1702615\">desperately trying</a> to gain support from Washington, including by involving its army chief to secure a multibillion-dollar loan package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). By cooperating on counter-terrorism with the US, Pakistan would naturally expect American support beyond military cooperation including securing financial packages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/16/afghanistan-money-biden-white-hosue-us\">Why is the White House stealing $7bn from Afghans? | Moustafa Bayoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is too early to predict precise outcomes in Afghanistan and the region from this incident. But the US seems to have signalled that it is able to dominate the sky over the country, and that it is willing to act. By demonstrating that they can attack with such precision, the CIA and other US entities will force other jihadist groups underground. Taliban factions who do not enjoy the full patronage of the Pakistani security establishment will also be worried about renewed US-Pakistan cooperation on drone strikes inside Afghanistan.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if the threat of US drone strikes will be used as leverage to influence Taliban behaviour.

How will this affect travellers and why have they done it?</p> <h2>Have any more British Airways flights been cancelled?</h2> <p>No additional flights have been cancelled as a result of the suspension of short-haul ticket sales.</p> <h2>Are any passengers being bumped? What if you have a ticket?</h2> <p>No. Passengers with existing bookings will still be able to travel and inbound flights will not be affected. Long-haul tickets are still on sale.</p> <h2>So what has BA done?</h2> <p>It has stopped selling any more last-minute tickets on its short-haul flights out of Heathrow to comply with the passenger cap announced by the London airport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/12/heathrow-airlines-stop-selling-summer-flights-airport-staff?curator=biztoc.com\">three weeks ago</a>. BA paused sales last weekend and has now extended that until 15 August.</p> <p>BA operates far more services from Heathrow than any other airline, with its own dedicated terminal, and agreed immediately to the cap, which limits passenger numbers to 100,000 a day across the airport.</p> <h2>What was the cap for?</h2> <p>The cap was to help ensure scheduled services could operate without delay amid last-minute cancellations, as the aviation industry continues to struggle to recruit and retain enough staff to meet the demand for flights after Covid travel restrictions were lifted.</p> <p>Heathrow says there is a dearth of ground staff, who are hired or contracted by airlines. That has contributed to large queues at check-ins and problems at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/20/easyjet-cut-flights-summer-holidays-london-gatwick\">baggage reclaim</a>, with the potential for any delays or hiccups to escalate into broader chaos.</p> <h2>So BA suspending short-haul sales was simply part of that agreement?</h2> <p>Yes. The airline says the decision will also “maximise rebooking options” for passengers bumped from those flights it did actually cancel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/06/three-more-train-companies-staff-vote-to-strike-raising-fears-of-major-disruption\">four weeks ago</a>.</p> <h2>Will it continue?</h2> <p>The cap is in place until 11 September. BA has now paused short-haul ticket sales for another week, until 15 August, and will keep the decision under review. It also plans to limit sales “dynamically” throughout the summer, without a blanket ban, restricting seats on particular flights at busy periods, although most outbound travel takes place in the first few weeks of the school holiday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Will it stop people travelling?</h2> <p>Few people will be directly affected. The vast majority of summer passengers are leisure travellers and bookwell in advance. In a normal year, many peak season services are fully booked . Those who wanted to travel specifically on a BA flight at the last minute – for example business travellers and frequent flyers with points – may be disappointed. But BA Heathrow summer fares were already prohibitive for most people – even those with enough disposable income for a summer holiday.</p> <p>The limit on capacity could increase air fares in general for people who have left it very late to book. Most short-haul destinations can be reached on alternative airlines from other London airports, or by less environmentally damaging methods, such as train, boat or car. BA’s profits will be affected only slightly by the loss of revenue from last-minute bookings.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/02/claire-holland-disappearance-man-rearrested-on-suspicion-of-murder","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T15:58:21Z","webTitle":"Claire Holland: Man rearrested on suspicion of 2012 Bristol murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/02/claire-holland-disappearance-man-rearrested-on-suspicion-of-murder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/02/claire-holland-disappearance-man-rearrested-on-suspicion-of-murder","fields":{"headline":"Claire Holland: Man rearrested on suspicion of 2012 Bristol murder","trailText":"Police announce development in case of woman last seen leaving pub after Queen’s diamond jubilee","byline":"Caroline Davies","body":"<p>A 40-year-old man has been rearrested on suspicion of murder after a “significant development” in the case of a woman who disappeared 10 years ago.</p> <p>Claire Holland, 32, was last seen leaving Seamus O’Donnell’s, a pub in Bristol, at 11.15pm on 6 June 2012 – the day after the Queen’s diamond jubilee weekend.</p> <p>Holland, a mother of four from Lawrence Weston in north-west Bristol, was reported missing a few days later.

Do you know Cockington, the village in Devon?</p> <p><strong>Vaguely, I guess</strong>. Great. Well, residents recently elected a four-year-old Shetland pony called Patrick as mayor. Now, the other thing you need to …</p> <p><strong>Wait. What? </strong>Patrick the pony is the mayor of Cockington. The old mayor died, and so a pony was elected to take his place. There’s nothing weird about it.</p> <p><strong>Did he run against anyone?</strong> No, it was a one-horse race.</p> <p><strong>I hate you. </strong>So anyway, before he became mayor, Patrick was a much-loved figure around the village. He was a therapy pony, visiting various recovery groups in the community, and could often be found grazing in an “interaction pen” in the garden of The Drum Inn, a pub in the village.</p> <p><strong>They elected a pony as the mayor? A </strong><em><strong>pony</strong></em><strong>? </strong>I’ve already explained that, yes. Anyway, Patrick has now been banned from The Drum Inn.</p> <p><strong>Because they didn’t like his policies?</strong> No, silly. He’s a pony. He doesn’t have any policies. The local council decreed that the pen required planning permission and had to be taken down. In addition, for Patrick to continue visiting the pub, the area would need to be reclassified from “garden” to “official grazing land”.</p> <p><strong>But he’s the mayor! Can’t he simply override the council?</strong> No, of course not. He’s a pony. But what makes this especially upsetting is that Patrick really loved drinking Guinness, so now he’ll have to go without.</p> <p><strong>I feel </strong><strong>like</strong><strong> I’m losing my mind.</strong> Don’t.

She subsequently ceased working for her firm, Credence Law Group, pending determination of her case.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/mbr-acres-limited-and-others-v-gillian-frances-mcgivern/\">In a damning written judgment</a>, handed down on Tuesday, Mr Justice Nicklin dismissed the case against McGivern as “totally without merit”. He noted that there had been a suggestion that she was pursued “because she was a lawyer helping some of the protesters” which, if true, would amount to abuse of process.</p> <p>He said: “I am unable to reach a conclusion as to the claimants’ motives for pursuing Ms McGivern. All I can say is I find them very difficult to understand. In my judgment this contempt application has been wholly frivolous, and it borders on vexatious. The breaches alleged were trivial or wholly technical.”</p> <p>The judge also criticised the line of questioning directed toward McGivern during the two day hearing last month. He described the solicitor, who had said from the outset that she had visited the site in her professional capacity and had no knowledge of the injunction, as a “conspicuously honest and careful witness”.</p> <p>By contrast, he said: “The claimants persisted in a cross-examination of Ms McGivern in which allegations of the utmost seriousness were made suggesting, not only that had she, a solicitor, had deliberately breached a court injunction, but that she had brazenly and repeatedly lied for over a day in the witness box. The evidential support for this line of cross-examination was tissue thin.”</p> <p>In questioning, McGivern, who was called to the bar in 1994 before becoming a solicitor, said that the contempt application against her had led to her “falling apart”. She said: “If I lose, I could lose my home. I will lose my reputation. I haven’t slept, I have barely eaten.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In light of his decision, Nicklin made an order requiring MBR Acres to obtain the permission of the court before they bring any further contempt application against any “persons unknown” alleged to have breached the injunction.</p> <p>Camp Beagle was set up in July last year.

Twenty-five Republican senators flipped their votes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/republicans-bill-healthcare-military-veterans-jon-stewart\">blocking the Pact Act’s passage</a>. “Why would Republicans screw over veterans on a bill that they previously voted for?” Colbert wondered. “Well, one theory is that they had their boxers in a bunch after Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer secretly negotiated a big climate deal.” Jon Tester, Democratic senator from Montana, <a href=\"https://www.tester.senate.gov/newsroom/news-coverage/daily-montanan-people-have-lost-their-minds-tester-responds-to-toxic-burn-pit-legislation-failing/\">attributed</a> the vote to “political payback” from people who had “lost their minds”.</p> <p>“Well, that would be some misdirected anger, GOP,” Colbert fumed. “That’s like a quarterback saying, ‘OK, huddle up, we’re down 20, I just threw an interception and the other team scored. Here’s the play: I’m going to go sucker-punch that old guy at the hot dog stand.’”</p> <p>Colbert then skewered Ted Cruz, who fist-bumped fellow GOP senator Steve Daines after blocking the bill for veterans’ healthcare he had previously voted for. “I imagine there’s some veterans out there who would also like to bump Ted Cruz with their fists,” said Colbert.</p> <h2><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1554272695637852160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You have to give credit to Donald Trump: the man is an absolute wizard at not paying taxes. <a href=\"https://t.co/H7HlPVidpN\">pic.twitter.com/H7HlPVidpN</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1554272695637852160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah marveled at the pettiness of Donald Trump, who last month had his ex-wife Ivana Trump buried near the first hole of Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, probably for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/donald-ivana-trump-cemetery-golf-course-taxes\">a tax break</a>. The strange burial site would exempt the golf course from New Jersey’s tax code, which does not tax land used as a cemetery.</p> <p>“Wow. A lot of people say, ‘I’ll pay taxes over my dead body,’ but Trump means it. Over someone else’s body,” Noah said.</p> <p>“Even for him, this feels like a step too far,” he continued. “I don’t care what anyone says. I wouldn’t even laugh at that as a joke. If someone said to me, ‘Donald Trump’s ex-wife died, he’s probably going to bury her on his golf course to save on taxes,’ I’d be like, ‘yo, that’s not cool, man.’</p> <p>“But it turns out Trump was like, ‘wait wait, say more. I’m going to send this to my accountant, keep going.’</p> <p>“What this really shows you is how strange the tax system can be,” Noah concluded. “All this tax break does is incentivize you to be a weirdo. Who came up with this? It almost feels like the law was written by a serial killer – ‘there should be a law, that if you bury a body in your yard, you don’t have to pay taxes any more.’”</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX30TlmWcK0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IX30TlmWcK0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon began with Biden’s rebound Covid case. “Right now, Biden’s looking on the bright side,” he said. “He’s like ‘well, at least my Covid got a second term.’</p> <p>“Usually when a 79-year-old is on the rebound, you’re meeting your new aunt named Barbara,” he joked. “The virus came back so fast the staffers didn’t even have time to take down the Get Well Soon balloons.”</p> <p>Fallon also wondered about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/mega-millions-winning-numbers-winner-lottery?CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium\">single Illinois ticket that won the $1.34bn Mega Millions jackpot</a> over the weekend. “The winner hasn’t come forward yet, so either they’re contacting financial experts, or they’re at home being like, ‘crap, where is it, I went swimming, no one turn on the washing machine!’” he said.</p> <p>And after a trip to Canada using a wheelchair and walker, Pope Francis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/pope-francis-says-canada-trip-showed-he-may-need-to-retire\">said</a> that he will need to either slow down or retire. “So I guess we know who won the Mega Millions,” Fallon joked. “Congratulations, your holiness.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T15:40:36Z","webTitle":"Ayman al-Zawahiri obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Ayman al-Zawahiri obituary","trailText":"Founder of al-Qaida with Osama bin Laden who went on to succeed him as its leader","byline":"Lawrence Joffe","body":"<p>After nearly two decades in hiding, the Egyptian terrorist Ayman al-Zawahiri, successor to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/osama-bin-laden-obituary\" title=\"\">Osama bin Laden</a> as head of al-Qaida, has died aged 71. He was killed by two missiles fired from a US drone at his home in central Kabul. Zawahiri provided the arguments and the systematic organisation that persuaded Bin Laden, six years his junior, to operate on an international scale, culminating in the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US that resulted in more than 3,000 deaths. However, after Bin Laden was killed by US forces in Pakistan in 2011, Zawahiri made threats, but never repeated atrocities against the west on the scale of 9/11.</p> \n<p>Once leader, he steered an al-Qaida demoralised by Bin Laden’s death, and later by the emergence in Iraq of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (IS) movement. Though the rival jihadis rapidly outdid al-Qaida in brutality, after five years they were largely crushed, leaving Zawahiri’s now more decentralised operation intact, and spreading.</p> \n<p>The extent to which Zawahiri had shaped al-Qaida showed in the 9/11 attacks. He placed Egyptian allies in key positions, improved the organisation’s use of media and introduced the blind-cell structure he had used in Egyptian jihadi circles, with lethal results.</p> \n<p>Bin Laden and Zawahiri both came from privileged backgrounds. The former was the son of a wealthy Saudi building contractor; the latter a product of Egypt’s educated class. Each was raised in religious but not especially radical households. Both gave up their chosen career paths – medicine in Zawahiri’s case, engineering in Bin Laden’s – to fight a global jihad against what they perceived as enemies of Islam.</p> \n<p>Zawahiri officially became leader of al-Qaida in June 2011, six weeks after US Navy Seals killed Bin Laden in Abbottabad. Al-Qaida affiliates from Yemen to Iraq, Pakistan to Malaysia, soon swore their allegiance to him. Zawahiri had formally been Bin Laden’s deputy since 1998 and chaired al-Qaida’s consultative council, and its religious committee, which issued fatwas. As a spokesperson, he often appeared on video; seven weeks after the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005, for instance, he hailed “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/sep/02/alqaida.politics\" title=\"\">the blessed London battle</a> … a slap to the face of the tyrannical, crusader British arrogance”.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, delays in choosing Bin Laden’s successor suggested schisms at the top and coincided with setbacks for the group. Starting in December 2010 in Tunisia and January 2011 in Egypt, young, mainly secular, protesters ousted two longstanding authoritarian Arab presidents. Al-Qaida, by contrast, had used violence for decades yet had not toppled a single ruler. Zawahiri’s claims rang hollow when in September 2011 he broadcast an hour-long oration about how 9/11 had prepared the way for what became known as the Arab spring, or what he called “Arab volcano”. By contrast with the charismatic Bin Laden, he seemed austere and less inspirational.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df2bd7517fd5d282ceed8a7335f7281848fb55dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df2bd7517fd5d282ceed8a7335f7281848fb55dd/0_12_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zawahiri, right, with Bin Laden in a television image  \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayman al-Zawahiri, right, with Osama bin Laden in a television image from an undisclosed location shortly after the 9/11 attacks.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Zawahiri was born in Maadi, a comfortable suburb of Cairo, in the year before the Free Officers overthrew the Egyptian monarchy in 1952. His father, Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri, was a professor of pharmacology at Cairo University. His mother, Umayma Azzam, came from a political family. Ayman’s paternal grandfather had been grand imam of al-Azhar University, the world’s most respected seat of Sunni Muslim learning. His uncle chaired the Egyptian Labour party and his grand-uncle Abdel-Rahman Azzam was the first secretary-general of the Arab League.</p> \n<p>From a state school Zawahiri went to Cairo University, and in 1974 graduated as a doctor. Proficient in English, French and Arabic, he took a master’s degree in surgery four years later and practised in the Egyptian military.</p> \n<p>At the age of 15 he was arrested for belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood. He called secular pan-Arabism a false panacea and in his book A Bitter Harvest (1991) rejected the Brotherhood’s ameliorative approach.</p> \n<p>From Sayyid Qutb, the Egyptian ideologue killed in an Egyptian jail in 1966, he accepted millenarian ideas that the world was in a state of ignorance, that all leaders of Muslim countries deserved denunciation as apostates, and that only armed struggle and sharia (religious law) could restore past Islamic glories. Zawahiri called democracy “a new religion that deifies humans and gives them the authority to formulate their own laws … while Islam gives the right to legislate exclusively to Allah”. More than anything, he wrote, Egypt’s rapid defeat in the June 1967 war persuaded him that existing Arab structures were bankrupt.</p> \n<p>In 1978, he married Azza Nowari, and soon travelled to Pakistan, where from 1980 he treated those injured in the Soviet invasion in neighbouring Afghanistan. Witnessing battlefield horrors fuelled his rage, and on returning home he galvanised the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) and a wing of the ultra-violent Takfir wal Hijra (Denunciation and Migration).</p> \n<p>In October 1981 extremists assassinated the Egyptian president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/oct/07/fromthearchive\" title=\"\">Anwar Sadat</a>, and when Cairo authorities could not prove Zawahiri’s direct complicity they charged him with illegal possession of arms. He was confined to a tiny cell and reportedly beaten every day, allegedly betraying associates under electric torture.</p> \n<p>After his release in 1984, the following year he left Egypt for Saudi Arabia and then Pakistan, never to return. He treated Afghan mujahideen, recruited and trained Arab volunteers to fight Russia’s Red Army, and met Bin Laden in Peshawar in 1986. Both men were inspired by the Palestinian jihadist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/17/the-caravan-abdallah-azzam-and-the-rise-of-global-jihad-review-recent-history-at-its-finest\" title=\"\">Abdullah Azzam</a>, with whom Bin Laden had set up the Afghan Services Bureau, Maktab al-Khidamat, in 1984. While Azzam wanted to attack Israel, Zawahiri’s chief target was Cairo.</p> \n<p>After Azzam was murdered in 1989, Zawahiri became Bin Laden’s new mentor, personal physician, spokesperson and arms procurer. Many credit him with steering Bin Laden towards dreams of global conquest, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/18/omar-abdel-rahman-blind-sheikh-dies-world-trade-center-bombing\" title=\"\">Omar Abdel-Rahman</a>, an Egyptian cleric who died in a US jail in 2017.</p> \n<p>Bin Laden and Zawahiri accused the Saudi royal family – “brothers of Satan” – of betraying Islam through deference to a Jewish-controlled west. After the 1991 Gulf war they charged the US with stealing Arab oil, propping up corrupt regimes, persecuting Palestinians and Iraqis, and occupying the holy soil of Arabia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a7798acb3205bfe7f0f604f73c1ae3a514fb613\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a7798acb3205bfe7f0f604f73c1ae3a514fb613/34_45_1414_1767/800.jpg\" alt=\"An undated picture of Ayman Zawahiri \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An undated picture of Ayman al-Zawahiri as a younger man.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Balkis Press/Abaca/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1992, Zawahiri’s EIJ and al-Gama’a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group) initiated a bloody campaign against state officials and Coptic Christians in Egypt. An EIJ attempt in 1993 on the life of the Egyptian prime minister Atef Sidqi backfired, when he survived; a schoolgirl was killed. As popular support ebbed and police harassment grew in Egypt, Zawahiri began to focus more on international operations. In June 1995, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-06-27-mn-17703-story.html\" title=\"\">EIJ gunmen fired at the Egyptian president</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/hosni-mubarak-obituary\" title=\"\">Hosni Mubarak</a>, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; in November the faction bombed the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad.</p> \n<p>Zawahiri also helped plan the massacre near Luxor in which 58 tourists and four Egyptians were killed in November 1997. He was sentenced to death in absentia in April 1999, along with his brother Mohammed, an EIJ military commander. By now, indigenous EIJ leaders had disowned him and renounced violence, feeling he had acted peremptorily by absorbing them into Bin Laden’s coalition in 1998.</p> \n<p>Zawahiri was granted asylum in Denmark in 1991, visited Dagestan, Yemen and Switzerland, held Dutch, Swiss and French passports and used a variety of names and considered founding a television channel in the Netherlands. He even gained a US green card and toured American mosques in 1993, ostensibly seeking charity for indigent Afghan orphans.</p> \n<p>Bin Laden moved his headquarters to Sudan late that year and Zawahiri followed. From his vast farm north of Khartoum he promoted al-Qaida’s expanding business interests, deepened ties with Sudan’s political elite, pioneered suicide attacks in Egypt and in 1996 set up Islamist sleeper cells in Bosnia.</p> \n<p>But infighting among militants, penetration by Egyptian spies and pressure from Washington led Sudan to expel al-Qaida. Zawahiri sought a new haven: in December 1996 Russian authorities, not realising his true identity, jailed him for six months after he tried to enter Chechnya. The next year he returned to Afghanistan, where in 1998 he co-signed with Bin Laden a fatwa that launched what they called the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, known as al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>Zawahiri urged Muslims to kill US soldiers and civilians and plunder their wealth. On 6 August that year, he warned Americans of “a response which we will write, with God’s help, in a language they will understand”. The next day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/20/africa-embassy-bombings-osama-bin-laden-kenya-tanzania-al-qaida\" title=\"\">terrorists bombed two US embassies in east Africa</a>, killing more than 200 people. The FBI offered $5m for his capture, later raised to $25m.</p> \n<p>In 2000, Zawahiri was blamed for the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen. In 2001, he hired the Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat to cultivate anthrax in a laboratory near Kandahar airport. Then came the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, atrocities consistent with Zawahiri’s approach. Interpol sought his arrest.</p> \n<p>That December, Zawahiri’s wife Azza and at least one of his children<strong> </strong>were killed in an American bombing raid in Afghanistan. The defeat of the country’s Taliban government severely hampered al-Qaida’s global effectiveness. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9b44cb7d-6d2f-48ce-8080-621b69e753c7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GF38FTGvydc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2005, Zawahiri pleaded with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\" title=\"\">Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, the leader of al-Qaida in post-Saddam Iraq, to stop killing Shia civilians and Sunni foes in such numbers. Muslim support for al-Qaida fell until Zarqawi’s death the following year. Zawahiri further inflamed intra-Muslim tensions when he accused Iran – and by extension, Shias – of being “religion-sellers” who helped the UK and US bring down the Taliban.</p> \n<p>Even before Bin Laden’s death, Zawahiri had established links with groups in Algeria, Mali, Libya, Nigeria, Uzbekistan, Indonesia and Egyptian Sinai around 2006, and with al-Shabaab in Somalia in 2008. In 2009, Zawahiri approved the merger of Saudi and Yemeni militants into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/05/yemen-al-qaida-franchise\" title=\"\">Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula</a>, AQAP, which proved to be the most loyal and effective of franchises. By this stage, US intelligence called Zawahiri al-Qaida’s strategic commander, relegating Bin Laden to ideological figurehead.</p> \n<p>However, the killing by US drone strikes of 14 AQAP senior leaders between 2011 and 2020 damaged al-Qaida, as did the rise of Zarqawi’s fanatical heirs. In April 2013 the former leader of al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-obituary\" title=\"\">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, announced the birth of IS in Raqqa, Syria. Soon his zealots were fighting al-Qaida’s official Syrian subsidiary, the al-Nusra Front. They attracted Nusra deserters and younger foreign recruits, including from Britain, France, the US and Australia. Unlike al-Qaida, IS conquered actual territory. They ultimately ruled an area as large as Britain between eastern Syria and northern Iraq. From Mosul’s al-Nuri mosque, Baghdadi declared a caliphate in July 2014 – something else Zawahiri had never done – and started marching on Baghdad.</p> \n<p>Zawahiri furiously rejected Baghdadi’s demand for allegiance. In January 2017 he called IS cowardly killers and power-hungry liars who “exceeded the limits of extremism” and “misused the enthusiasm of youth”. Eventually an unlikely alliance of Shia and Kurdish militias, Iranian land forces and US air power defeated IS. Al-Baghdadi was killed in 2019.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-killing-unlikely-to-significantly-weaken-al-qaida\">Zawahiri’s killing unlikely to weaken al-Qaida significantly</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By then Zawahiri was the “defining authority” of Hurras al-Din, a coalition of seven factions fighting moderate Syrian rebels, US forces and the Assad regime. But a rebranded Nusra Front disavowed ties with al-Qaida in 2017.</p> \n<p>In 2014, Zawahiri launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/08/al-qaida-indian-subcontinent-revenge-attacks-prophet-remarks\" title=\"\">al-Qaida in the Indian subcontinent</a> to counter IS in Asia. In 2020, UN monitors admitted that al-Qaida was “deeply embedded” with the Taliban, and Zawahiri had directly advised them in talks with Washington. Al-Qaida cooperated in particular with the Taliban’s radical Haqqani network.</p> \n<p>Al-Qaida benefited from the 2020 US-Taliban Doha agreement, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan starting in April 2021, and especially the Taliban conquest of Afghanistan the following August. In 2016, Zawahiri had declared loyalty to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/01/taliban-leader-hits-out-foreign-demands-afghan-government\" title=\"\">Hibatullah Akhundzada</a>, the Taliban’s then new <em>amir al-mu’minin</em> (commander of the faithful). Five years later he was delighted when the elusive Akhundzada became Afghanistan’s de facto leader.</p> \n<p>Clearly, the Taliban had broken their 2020 promise to the Trump administration to sever ties with al-Qaida. A June 2022 UN report noted increased al-Qaida communications, spoke of influence over Taliban ministers, and warned that Afghanistan might become a base for resumed al-Qaida long-range attacks. </p> \n<p>Zawahiri soon moved from the Pakistani borderlands to join his family in the affluent Sherpur neighbourhood of Kabul.</p> \n<p>He is survived by three wives and a number of children.</p> \n<p>• Ayman Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri, terrorist leader, born 19 June 1951; died 31 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/02/pearson-plans-to-sell-its-textbooks-as-nfts","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T15:37:17Z","webTitle":"Pearson plans to sell its textbooks as NFTs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/02/pearson-plans-to-sell-its-textbooks-as-nfts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/02/pearson-plans-to-sell-its-textbooks-as-nfts","fields":{"headline":"Pearson plans to sell its textbooks as NFTs","trailText":"Educational publisher’s move into non-fungible tokens is intended to claw back some of the income lost to secondhand sales","byline":"Lucy Knight","body":"<p>Textbook publisher Pearson plans to profit from secondhand sales by turning its titles into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), its chief executive has said.</p> <p>Educational books are often sold more than once, since students sell study resources they no longer require.

NFT technology is largely being used in books as a way for authors to self-publish. And while digital distributors such as <a href=\"https://publishingperspectives.com/2021/05/bookwire-announces-a-blockchain-platform-an-nft-marketplace/\">Germany’s Bookwire have launched NFT marketplaces</a>, as the author and performer Walker Caplan noted in <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-rise-of-the-crypto-writer-on-what-literary-nfts-might-mean-for-the-book-world/\">LitHub last year</a>, much of the publishing world does not yet feel the need to engage with this new technology.

But while recent hits such as Halloween Kills and Scream 5 have mostly coasted on nostalgia, replaying the same old hits, stabbings and beheadings, Dutch director Halina Reijn’s English-language debut asks the difficult question of whether there’s anything truly <em>new</em> to do with the stalk-and-slash format most of us know so, or perhaps too, well.

The setup is one that, pleasingly, leans big into familiar whodunnit-cum-slasher tropes – a group of friends, a remote old house, a menacing storm – but there’s a novel, if not entirely surprising, last-act twist that separates it from the crowd. I would say once all cards have been played it’s a film that’s easier to admire than to love, a trick to reluctantly applaud rather than cheer for.</p> <p>After yet another summer season of frustratingly coy yet smugly over-publicised moments of LGBT representation (a look! A suggestion! A longing!), it’s a refreshing statement of intent to begin with an extended, closeup, full-tongued kiss between two women. As with many elements of Bodies Bodies Bodies, there are no half-measures in how it deals with its queerness, two gay leads who proceed to have other gay flirtations and gay entanglements throughout, yet another example of how the horror genre has been <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/rise-of-queer-horror-hannibal-chucky-shudder/\">embracing queer characters of late</a> (see also: They/Them, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/30/fear-street-part-1-1994-review-netflix-trilogy\">the Fear Street trilogy</a> and <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3723624/knock-at-the-cabin-m-night-shyamalans-next-is-an-adaptation-of-paul-tremblays-the-cabin-at-the-end-of-the-world/\">M Night Shyamalan’s next</a>). It’s a big trip for Bee (Maria Bakalova), nervous to meet the friends of her newish girlfriend Sophie (Amandla Stenberg), the pair driving up to the lavish mansion owned by the parents of Sophie’s obnoxious childhood best friend David (Pete Davidson). But they’re met with dropped jaws by the group (Industry’s Myha’la Herrold, Shiva Baby’s Rachel Sennott, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/10/generation-review-ambitious-sexually-fluid-teen-show-rings-hollow\">Generation</a> survivor Chase Sui Wonders and Lee Pace) palpable, awkward surprise, as well as annoyance, that Sophie would show her face, especially after she’s been so unreliable on the group text …</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTzGKsZjBOY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cTzGKsZjBOY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But as the storm takes hold, debauchery takes over, and the group drinks, smokes and snorts their way into an uneasy truce. As the only sober one, after recently leaving rehab, a fun-starved Sophie decides that it’s time for a game: Bodies Bodies Bodies. The rules are simple: everyone gets a piece of paper, one is marked with X, which means they’re the killer, and then the lights go out.</p> <p>It doesn’t take long for bodies to start piling up for real, but what invigorates a familiar formula is an unusually firm grasp on character, something that even the best slasher films fail to even bother with. In a genre where someone having a surname amounts to character development, there’s some relative heft here with a set of clearly drawn, if vapid and/or deeply unlikable, twentysomethings believably bitching and jabbing as the death count goes up. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMgLMaLlK9k\">The first, incredibly annoying, trailer</a> was something of a red flag, suggesting a film that confused buzzwords with satire (triggered! Safe space! Gaslighting!) but the script is far defter and less mean-spirited than that implied. The film isn’t striving to desperately provide any sort of social commentary/dissertation on Gen Z right now (the characters just … are) and is far better for it, especially at a time when too many horror films are clumsily taking on far more than they can really handle.</p> <p>DeLappe’s specific and spiky dialogue receives an extra lift from one of the better-orchestrated ensembles in recent memory, with Sennott the real standout, acing comic support without overplaying, turning even throwaway lines into zingers (it’s only a rather tedious Davidson who provides the bum notes, gratingly playing to type yet again). So many “cool” horror films in recent years have been made with a certain icy remove, as if the goal is to impress rather than immerse, so it’s gratifying to see Reijn lean into the hokey extremes of the sinister situation with a location Agatha Christie would approve of, and enough thunderous sound to make us believe there’s a real storm raging around us. It’s only in the last act that things start to lag, as we head towards a reveal the film isn’t quite equipped to deal with, a twist that requires major lapses in suspense and tension for reasons I can’t get into. It relies on a moment of absurdist comedy at the very end that didn’t work for me, and the overwhelming feeling one is left with is emptiness. It’s nifty but dramatically unsatisfying.</p> <p>Whodunnits require so many moving parts to be expertly placed and played with, and, ultimately, the script isn’t as sleek as it needs to be with a board as ambitious as this. The game is a fun one, but you might feel a little cheated once it’s over.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bodies Bodies Bodies is out in US cinemas on 5 August and in the UK on 9 September</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/02/readers-on-their-memories-of-seeing-joni-mitchell-live","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T15:30:01Z","webTitle":"‘I was overwhelmed with emotion’: readers on their memories of seeing Joni Mitchell live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/02/readers-on-their-memories-of-seeing-joni-mitchell-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/02/readers-on-their-memories-of-seeing-joni-mitchell-live","fields":{"headline":"‘I was overwhelmed with emotion’: readers on their memories of seeing Joni Mitchell live","trailText":"After her surprise appearance at the Newport folk festival, Guardian readers share their recollections of Mitchell’s rare gigs","byline":"Guardian readers","body":"<h2>‘I cheered and someone glared at me for the noise’</h2> <p>It was my first concert, at the RDS Main Hall in Dublin in early 1983. I’d recently bought her then-new LP Wild Things Run Fast. I remember cheering when one of the new songs came on and someone next to me glared at me for the noise. I risked taking my camera in and got some photos – the one below is the only one I can locate. I don’t remember much else of the concert after almost 40 years. At the time I was living in a small Irish midlands town due to my job, but I made the effort to drive down in my new (to me) Mini on my first long road trip to Dublin.

It was a difficult performance and she was clearly unnerved by a restless audience. It was a rowdy crowd, probably more suited to the likes of the Who, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix and Jethro Tull. Other acoustic performers such as Leonard Cohen also suffered from an audience disinclined to sit and listen to the music. It was also a time of agitprop and radical politics – music should be free, man – and it was overwhelmingly male.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d118b4b21bb8dd4685556fcf0aa00c60e78f5792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d118b4b21bb8dd4685556fcf0aa00c60e78f5792/0_0_988_638/500.jpg\" alt=\"Joni Mitchell and Tom Scott playing at the Isle of Wight festival in August 1970.\" width=\"500\" height=\"323\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joni Mitchell and Tom Scott playing at the Isle of Wight festival in August 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These were still early days for Joni. Her third album, and her breakthrough in the UK, Ladies of the Canyon had only been released a few months before so she was not at all well known. But once she got the measure of the occasion, she delivered a stunning performance, with the help of a great band led by Tom Scott. Working at the festival, I had the opportunity to take photos in front of the stage. I was 18, just entering the music industry, managing one of very few official food outlets on site, which gave me the huge benefit of a stage front pass.</p> <p>The next time I saw her was at Wembley Stadium in 1974, with much the same band, led again by Tom Scott, this time with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and the Band. By this time the UK had woken up to west coast music. Joni had also released three more albums – Blue, For the Roses and Court and Spark, and was an acknowledged talent. <strong>Philip Haines, 70, Exeter </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"40352f326b979f2fcc959571441b0de40b8b134c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40352f326b979f2fcc959571441b0de40b8b134c/0_0_1274_1862/684.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Forsyth’s Joni Mitchell autograph.\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Forsyth’s Joni Mitchell autograph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>‘I don’t think I appreciated how privileged I was’</h2> <p>I only got to see Joni once, on the Wild Things Run Fast tour in 1983 at the Edinburgh Playhouse. I was right at the front and I don’t think that I really appreciated at the time quite how privileged I was. I remember in particular just how relaxed she seemed, holding the audience enthralled. It was not her greatest period or band, but the set ranged across her career. There was a short solo acoustic set, which was sublime.</p> <p>Afterwards, I hung around by the stage door with a few others, where a limo was waiting, and she autographed my programme (remember those?). It was a fantastic, memorable night. I have come and gone a bit with Joni over the years, but along with Bowie she is an artist who has been a companion all my adult life. <strong>Iain Forsyth, 60, business analyst in the public sector, London </strong></p> <h2>‘She changed for ever how I view performing artists’</h2> <p>I saw her in Nashville in 1974 with Tom Scott and the LA Express. It was an amazing night after several days of bad, sometimes scary, weather. She quietly commented: “I can’t believe things can be so beautiful and yet so mean.” Later in the evening, as she glided gracefully through her acoustic set, some audience members lovingly shouted out requests. With the slightest smile, she said: “Nobody ever asked Van Gogh to paint Starry Night again.” We cheered, and in the moment, she changed for ever how I view performing artists. <strong>Cathey Sawyer, theatre director, actor and playwright, West Virginia </strong></p> <h2>‘I was overwhelmed with emotion’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5130936d4223328d183b8a807ccb72be442c887a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5130936d4223328d183b8a807ccb72be442c887a/225_33_962_1203/800.jpg\" alt=\"Debbie Smith.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debbie Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was 15 years old when I first heard Joni Mitchell. The first track I heard was The Circle Game – not one of my favourites now – but I was hooked. The first album I heard was Song to a Seagull and I still listen to it now. In 1983, I had been married for 18 months, living and working in London and managed to get two tickets for Joni Mitchell at Wembley in April.</p> <p>I remember crying as we walked up the long path to the old Wembley Stadium and feeling overwhelmed with emotion that I was surrounded by hundreds of other people who felt the same way I felt about Joni Mitchell’s music and her words. We were standing in the main arena but quite a long way back. I managed to make my way nearer to the front, singing along to every song. It was just magical. I can always find a Joni Mitchell song to fit my mood and her words are so clever – she is a poet. My favourite track is probably People’s Parties, though picking one track is really impossible. Her music can still make me cry. <strong>Debbie Smith, 63, Eastbourne </strong></p> <h2>‘I saw her in Birmingham for £6.50’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"70aa9cd76ef548a636f969b54d6df9d2f71ac696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70aa9cd76ef548a636f969b54d6df9d2f71ac696/0_530_3024_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Conway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"966\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Conway’s ticket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I saw her in Birmingham in 1983.

Even now, when a Joni track is played on the radio – 6 Music, mainly – I can sing along almost word-perfect and I am transported. If ever I need uplifting, Coyote from the film The Last Waltz will do it – guaranteed.

This is how they’re made","trailText":"Experts monitor patients for days, or even months, to reach a decision – there is no easy litmus test, says Mehrunisha Suleman, director of medical ethics at the University of Oxford","byline":"Mehrunisha Suleman","body":"<p>UK courts have once again had to rule on an incredibly fraught case about the withdrawal of life support from a child: 12-year-old Archie Battersbee was found in an unconscious state by his mother on 7 April this year and never regained consciousness. The clinical team at Barts Health NHS trust viewed that it would not be in Archie’s best interests for him to continue to receive medical intervention. Archie’s parents disagreed, and sought the court’s support to have medical intervention continued. The court of appeal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/01/archie-battersbee-court-refuses-further-postpone-end-of-life-support\">has ruled</a> that it is legal for the medical team to withdraw his life support, and the supreme court has dismissed the family’s final appeal.</p> <p>The tragic nature of how Archie became ill and the minutiae of the subsequent legal processes will likely be the subject of public and academic scrutiny for some time. However, what is not in dispute is that these decisions are immensely complex, and often include experts considering information that isn’t in the public domain. What does need closer inspection is how cases like Archie’s and others that have recently been brought to the courts (those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/28/charlie-gard-dies\">Charlie Gard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/28/alfie-evans-timeline-of-key-events\">Alfie Evans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/british-girl-who-won-life-support-legal-battle-is-out-of-intensive-care\">Tafida Raqeeb</a>, to name a few) move beyond the sphere of medical decision-making and careful deliberation among healthcare teams, patients and families, to the stark arbitration of our legal system.</p> <p>Suffering a life-threatening illness or injury may mean that a child requires medical intervention to support basic functions that can maintain life, such as breathing. When they are brought to hospital, clinical teams will do their utmost to care for and treat a patient if there are any signs of life. The professional duties of clinical teams, their ethical standards and the UK legal system all currently include a presumption <a href=\"https://www.gmc-uk.org/-/media/documents/treatment-and-care-towards-the-end-of-life---english-1015_pdf-48902105.pdf\">in favour of prolonging life</a>. Beginning an initial course of treatment also allows clinical teams time to more fully assess the extent of the patient’s illness or injury. Such an evaluation is ongoing as patients differ markedly in terms of the nature and extent of the support they need, and whether and how their body responds to treatment.</p> <p>The questions they would be looking to answer include: what is the extent of the patient’s illness or injury? How is their underlying health? Do they have physical reserves that will help their recovery? How likely are they to recover? If they can recover, what will be their quality of life? If they are unlikely to recover, then what is their current condition? What are the likely benefit and burdens associated with the medical interventions they are currently receiving?</p> <p>Clinical teams also assess what a patient’s wishes would be and whether they would have a preference for medical intervention being continued or withdrawn. Adults can make their wishes known through advance directives or <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lasting-power-attorney-duties\">lasting power of attorney</a>. Children, who are legally unable to avail themselves of such tools, rely on their parents, their lawyer or a guardian to make decisions on their behalf and to help clinical teams understand what their wishes would be.</p> <p>In cases where there are disputes between families and clinical teams, and the decision is then referred to the courts – as in Archie’s case – the ethical question that is often most pertinent is whether medical intervention should continue. In such cases clinical teams either consider the patient to be dead, or they consider continued intervention to be burdensome or harmful to the point that it would be unethical to continue. “Best interest” decisions involve delicate deliberations on the patient’s condition, and are some of the hardest decisions that clinical teams are required to make.</p> <p>The likelihood of recovery and the degree of harm an unconscious patient is experiencing can be difficult to pin down. These decisions are made more robust by multiple experts, sometimes with a combined experience of a hundred years, who monitor head scans, heart traces, blood tests, pupillary responses and muscle reflexes. They do so repeatedly over days, weeks and even months to establish trends and to understand which of their interventions are helpful and ought to be sustained or increased and which are likely to be equivocal or harmful and ought to be stopped.</p> <p>Such consideration and careful titration reveals medicine more as an art than a science. There is no litmus test or easy read-out of what to do when a patient is unconscious and requires artificial means to stay alive. In the case of children, in the UK, “best interests” decisions are weighted even more heavily towards sustaining life. As such, a decision to withdraw intervention from a child is likely to rely very heavily on a clinical team’s judgment of such intervention being harmful and providing no chance of enabling a life through unsupported means.</p> <p>Recently, ethics committees have had a larger role in supporting clinical teams – they consult families and relevant experts to understand what is at stake and whether there are aspects of the patient’s care that may require further assessment, for example, involvement of additional experts such as a palliative care team.</p> <p>We also need a wider public discussion about what it means to support people artificially through medical means – and to allow children as well as adults to make their wishes known about what they would like to have (and not have) done to them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Mehrunisha Suleman is director of medical ethics and law education at the Ethox Centre,<strong> </strong>University of Oxford</p></li> </ul> <p>• This article was amended on 4 August 2022 to clarify that in a case such as that of Archie Battersbee a lawyer and children’s guardian may be appointed to safeguard the interests of the child.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/02/jamal-edwards-died-of-heart-attack-after-using-cocaine-coroner-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T15:09:51Z","webTitle":"Jamal Edwards died of heart attack after using cocaine, coroner finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/02/jamal-edwards-died-of-heart-attack-after-using-cocaine-coroner-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/02/jamal-edwards-died-of-heart-attack-after-using-cocaine-coroner-finds","fields":{"headline":"Jamal Edwards died of heart attack after using cocaine, coroner finds","trailText":"YouTube star who helped launch careers of Ed Sheeran, Dave and Skepta died in February aged 31","byline":"David Batty","body":"<p>The music entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/jamal-edwards\">Jamal Edwards</a> died from a heart attack after taking cocaine and drinking alcohol, a coroner has concluded.</p> <p>Edwards, a YouTube star who helped launch the careers of Ed Sheeran, Dave and Skepta, died in February aged 31.</p> <p>An inquest held at the west London coroner’s court on Tuesday concluded that the cause of death was drug-related.</p> <p>The assistant coroner, Ivor Collett, said there was evidence of cocaine toxicity in Edwards’ body, as well as the presence of alcohol, which probably caused his death after he returned home from performing a DJ set in Islington in the early hours of 20 February.</p> <p>The coroner’s reported added: “After drinking some alcohol with a friend, his behaviour changed and became erratic and he appeared paranoid, before he collapsed and became unconscious. Attempts at resuscitation failed and life was declared extinct at 10.36.”</p> <p>Edwards’ mother, Brenda Edwards, a singer and Loose Women panellist, described him as “a beautiful and selfless person” in a statement read to the inquest.</p> <p>She added: “Since growing up with his family in Acton he made it his personal mission to open doors for others to walk through. To help people through life, to love and to laugh. And most importantly, to just make people happy.”</p> <p>She revealed in June that her son’s death was drug-related, saying <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brenda_edwards/status/1534084004693131264\">in a statement</a> that she was in a “state of shock” about the circumstances.</p> <p>“I have sadly learned that the cause of Jamal’s devastating passing was due to cardiac arrhythmia,” she said. “[This was] caused by having taken recreational drugs and I wanted to address this myself to everyone who loved, admired and respected my son.”</p> <p>Brenda Edwards said she hoped publicising the circumstances of her son’s death might prevent other families suffering a similar loss.</p> <p>“These types of substances are extremely unpredictable, and we can only hope that this will encourage others to think wisely when faced with similar situations in the future,” she said. “His passing has shown that any one bad decision on any one occasion can lead to devastating consequences.”</p> <p>Edwards, who founded the pioneering online music platform <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sbtv\">SBTV</a> in 2006, was credited with helping to launch the careers of a string of UK music stars, including Stormzy and Jessie J. He was also an ambassador for the Prince’s Trust, a charity led by the Prince of Wales, and in 2014 was made an MBE for his services to music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February, Sheeran led tributes to Edwards, writing on Instagram: “Jamal is my brother.

He grew especially fond of stepping out on to the balcony after morning prayers, so that he could watch the sun rise over the Afghan capital.</p> <p>According to a US official who briefed reporters on Monday, it was such regular behavior that allowed intelligence agents, presumably CIA, to piece together what they called “a pattern of life” of the target. That in turn allowed them to launch what the White House called a “tailored airstrike” involving two Hellfire missiles fired from a Reaper drone that are claimed to have struck the balcony, with Zawahiri on it, at 6.18am on Sunday.</p> <p>It was the culmination of a decades-long hunt for the Egyptian surgeon who by the time he was killed had a $25m bounty on his head. Zawahiri, 71, was held accountable not only for his part as Bin Laden’s second in command for 9/11, with its death toll of almost 3,000 people, but also for several other of al-Qaida’s most deadly attacks, including the suicide bombing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/29/alqaida.usa\">the USS Cole </a>in Yemen in October 2000, which killed 17 US sailors.</p> <p>The mission to go after the al-Qaida leader was triggered, US officials said, in early April when intelligence sources picked up signals that Zawahiri and his family had moved off their mountainside hideaways and relocated to Kabul. Following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan last August, and with the support of the Haqqani Taliban network, Zawahiri and his wife, together with their daughter and grandchildren, had moved into the Sherpur house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/kabul_close_locator/giv-6562fW92i3Cx2LSR/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/kabul_close_locator/giv-6562fW92i3Cx2LSR/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In their telling of events, US officials were at pains to stress that under Joe Biden’s instructions the mission was carried out carefully and with precision to avoid civilian casualties<strong> </strong>and US officials said no one else was killed or wounded in the attack.</p> <p>Social media images of the strike suggested the use of a modified Hellfire called the R9X with six blades to damage targets, sources familiar with the weapon told Reuters. They caused surprisingly little damage beyond the target, suggesting they may be a version of the missile shrouded in secrecy and used by the US to avoid non-combatant casualties.</p> <p>The US president was first apprised of Zawahiri’s whereabouts in April, and for the next two months a tightly knit group of officials delved into the intelligence and devised a plan. A scale model of the Sherpur house was built, showing the balcony where the al-Qaida leader liked to sit. As discussions about a possible strike grew more intense, the model was brought into the situation room of the White House on 1 July so that Biden could see it for himself.</p> <p>The president “examined closely the model of al-Zawahiri’s house that the intelligence community had built and brought into the White House situation room for briefings on this issue”, a senior administration official told reporters.</p> <p>The White House made further claims to bolster its argument that the attack was lawful, flawless and with a loss of life limited to Zawahiri alone. Officials said that engineers were brought in to analyse the safe house and assess what would happen to it structurally in the wake of a drone strike.</p> <p>Lawyers were similarly consulted on whether the attack was legal. They advised that it was, given the target’s prominent role as leader of a terrorist group.</p> <p>Biden, by now quarantined with Covid, received a final briefing on 25 July and gave the go-ahead. It was a decision in stark contrast to the advice he gave Barack Obama in May 2011 not to proceed with the special forces mission that killed Bin Laden in a raid on his safe house in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/death-osama-bin-laden-us\">Abbottabad, Pakistan</a>.</p> <p>On Monday evening, Biden stood on his own balcony – this one in the White House with the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial as his backdrop – to address the nation.</p> <p>“I authorized the precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all,” Biden said. “This measure was carefully planned, rigorously, to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians.”</p> <p>Biden’s insistence that no one other than the al-Qaida leader was killed in the attack was amplified repeatedly by US officials. The narrative given by the White House was that Zawahiri was taken out cleanly through the application of modern technological warfare.</p> <p>Skepticism remains, despite the protestations. Over the years drone strikes have frequently proved to be anything but precise.</p> <p>In August last year one such US drone strike in Kabul was initially hailed by the Pentagon as a successful mission to take out a would-be terrorist bomber planning an attack on the city’s airport. It was only after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000007963596/us-drone-attack-kabul-investigation.html?link_id=6&amp;can_id=17b383b244cbfd6b80f03263d1e61612&amp;source=email-drone-assassination-inconvenient-facts-interviews-available&amp;email_referrer=email_1622123&amp;email_subject=drone-assassination-inconvenient-facts-interviews-available\">the New York Times</a> had published an exhaustive investigation showing that the strike had in fact killed 10 civilians, including an aid worker and seven children, that the US military admitted the mission had gone tragically wrong.</p> <p>Perhaps mindful of the doubts that are certain to swirl around the Zawahiri killing for days to come, the White House said that the Sherpur safe house where the drone strike happened had been kept under observation for 36 hours after the attack and before Biden spoke to the nation. Officials said that Zawahiri’s relatives were seen leaving the house under Haqqani Taliban escort, establishing that they had survived the strike.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/brazil-failing-fully-investigate-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira-murders","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T15:01:19Z","webTitle":"Brazil ‘failing to fully investigate’ Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira murders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/brazil-failing-fully-investigate-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira-murders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/brazil-failing-fully-investigate-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira-murders","fields":{"headline":"Brazil ‘failing to fully investigate’ Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira murders","trailText":"Rights groups accuse Brazilian government of not employing sufficient resources to examine case","byline":"Andrew Downie","body":"<p>Leading human rights organisations have criticised the Brazilian government for what they say is a failure to properly investigate the murders of the Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira and the British journalist Dom Phillips.</p> <p>The two men were shot dead in June but eight organisations said that from the moment they disappeared, to the discovery of their bodies, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/22/three-charged-brazil-murder-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira\">the indictment of three men for their murders</a>, Brazilian authorities have “not employed sufficient resources to fully comprehend all the elements in the case and the responsibility of all those involved”.</p> <p>The far-right government of President Jair Bolsonaro has also failed to implement measures “to prevent tragedies like those that happened to Dom and Bruno from occurring to other people who are active in the [area],” the organisations wrote in a letter to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</p> <p>Promises to bolster security in the notoriously unsafe Amazonian region “have not been translated into concrete actions,” the letter, sent on 27 July but only made public this week, added.</p> <p>The signatories include Article 19, Reporters Without Borders and the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism, and comes after the Bolsonaro administration said it had complied with all the commission’s requests.</p> <p>Phillips and Pereira went missing on 5 June at the end of a trip in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/09/dom-phillips-javari-valley-brazil-amazon-cocaine-smuggling\">the Javari valley</a>, a densely forested region on Brazil’s western border with Peru.</p> <p>Phillips was researching a book called How to Save the Amazon and was aided by Pereira, who worked with Indigenous tribes there and knew the region well. </p> <p>The pair were shot dead at the side of the Itaquai River by men who ambushed their boat as it headed towards their final destination of Atalaia do Norte.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/17/dom-phillips-bruno-pereira-final-journey\">How the final journey of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira ended in tragedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The alleged killers had clashed with Pereira on previous occasions.

Yes: England scored a first-half goal and began a major tournament without looking flustered or getting booed off the pitch at full time. It was comfortable rather than easy, composed rather than fluent. But as England completed their lap of honour in front of 69,000 cheering fans, the sense was of a team that were simply relieved to be off and running, determined to ride this wave of noise all the way to the end.</p> <p>For all England’s busyness, their 15 shots on goal, perhaps the moment that best encapsulated them came just seconds from the end. Leah Williamson received the ball in defence, with Austrian shirts flooding forward in an attempt to hunt her down. If ever there was a time for getting rid, it was here. Instead Williamson looked up and pinged a precise 40-yard pass all along the ground to Georgia Stanway. On a night of peak pressure and peak expectation, England kept their heads, and somehow this felt like the most crucial victory of all.</p> <p>This is not how England teams are meant to start tournaments. The rules are very clear on this. Instead England never really felt threatened after Beth Mead’s opening goal.

They have three minutes of injury time to survive and cling on to this eight-goal deficit. It really has been a remarkable England performance.</p> <p><strong>Full-time: England 8-0 Norway </strong>Peep! PEEP!! PEEEP!!!

The Chelsea forward has been in magical form for England during the group stage of the European Championship, the creative hub of the midfield, and her goal followed a typically selfless move to set up Georgia Stanway when she perhaps should have taken a shot herself.</p> <p>Kirby’s goal opened the gate which the Lionesses would pour through in their final game in Group A to maintain a perfect start to their Euro 2022 campaign.</p> <p>England’s smooth run through the group stage hit a small speed bump with the announcement earlier in the day that their manager had tested positive for Covid and would remain at the team’s west London base. The 52-year-old’s assistant, Arjan Veurink, who joined from the Netherlands with her, instead led the team at St Mary’s. He said before kick-off that the impact would be minimal, that Wiegman was “doing OK” and that she would be in contact with him and the rest of the staff during the game. “She is not here, but she will be,” he said. If there was ever a right time for England to lose their manager, this was perhaps it. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/15/england-northern-ireland-womens-euro-2022-group-a-match-report\">Suzanne Wrack</a><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"fab43c4394a34587a9999bc4863bae9dfcc1d60b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fab43c4394a34587a9999bc4863bae9dfcc1d60b/0_413_2901_2900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Northern Ireland fan shows their support prior to the group game against England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Northern Ireland fan shows their support prior to the group game against England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Lander/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"2cf17d4cb764ff44a27dfea413d18ce99a59197a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cf17d4cb764ff44a27dfea413d18ce99a59197a/530_0_2334_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An England fan is pictured in fancy dress with face paint before the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An England fan is pictured in fancy dress with face paint before the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisi Niesner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"080359a2671c76443fb9befb0b76125eba6f0bbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/080359a2671c76443fb9befb0b76125eba6f0bbb/0_0_3500_1939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Fran Kirby scores their first goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"554\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Fran Kirby scores their first goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce6172020d8a84414a4165cfcc247ae6e08005ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6172020d8a84414a4165cfcc247ae6e08005ec/0_22_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Northern Ireland’s Marissa Callaghan and England’s Keira Walsh vie for a header.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Northern Ireland’s Marissa Callaghan and England’s Keira Walsh vie for a header.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7ef62f27a4a2bfc8a72df625df6936f8b9bbd39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7ef62f27a4a2bfc8a72df625df6936f8b9bbd39/41_0_3419_2051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Alessia Russo scores their third goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Alessia Russo scores their third goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18a70aa32c0849895bb5c8e1a3857546084b8c35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18a70aa32c0849895bb5c8e1a3857546084b8c35/0_186_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fran Kirby of England speaks to the media in the flash interview after her side’s victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fran Kirby of England speaks to the media in the flash interview after her side’s victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maddie Meyer/UEFA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Northern Ireland and England fans show off their face paint; England’s Fran Kirby thumps home the opening goal; Northern Ireland’s Marissa Callaghan and England’s Keira Walsh vie for a header; Alessia Russo heads home England’s third goal; Kirby speaks to the media after her side’s victory.

Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Uefa/Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p><br>The party was almost over but then Ella Toone turned up and the place went wild again. A goal down and on the edge of elimination with six minutes left, England had been made to suffer by a superb Spain side, but a late equaliser from the Manchester United midfielder took them into extra time where Georgia Stanway smashed in a shot straight out of a comic to carry them into the last four. Next stop on this wild ride: Sheffield.</p> <p>It wasn’t until after 10pm that they started singing “It’s coming home” here, so hard had it been. Now at last they could believe it really might be, which isn’t to say they wouldn’t suffer more – oh, they would – but by the end England’s players were standing at the side of the pitch belting out Sweet Caroline. “So good, so good,” they sang, and it certainly had been. This was a wonderful match, graced by both teams. A heroic, exhausting occasion they will never forget. Spain had shone but England resisted and rebelled, overturning Esther González’s strike – the first they have conceded at the tournament and one that threatened to bring it to a premature end.</p> <p>In the end, though, it was England who are still standing, the goal that took them there one of those moments you could see unfold and may well be watching for years, Stanway striding forward and letting fly … her shot tore through the air and took a whole country with it, the party swinging now.<em> </em><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/20/england-spain-womens-euro-2022-quarter-final-match-report\">Sid Lowe</a><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"047994a6366c830c3749977c68d92e500e3dd055\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/047994a6366c830c3749977c68d92e500e3dd055/718_0_2972_2972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An England fan replicates the Ellen White celebration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An England fan replicates the Ellen White celebration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Ivill/UEFA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"10cefc30269b9740c3797d9b1ec3cc8d971d244c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10cefc30269b9740c3797d9b1ec3cc8d971d244c/831_227_2106_2106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Spain fan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Spain fan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b5749710ea7ad9182e18d12150662cd90538a12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b5749710ea7ad9182e18d12150662cd90538a12/0_0_3500_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England fans buy ice creams outside the stadium before the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England fans buy ice creams outside the stadium before the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"d2c0e1fe48927133fa58eb9be6865d2658045e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2c0e1fe48927133fa58eb9be6865d2658045e67/630_0_3089_3088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England fans wearing shirts with the names of Ellen White and Fran Kirby look on outside the stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England fans wearing shirts with the names of Ellen White and Fran Kirby look on outside the stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"73e281a01e0e0a8b9500dfa131ec2dc7e7540024\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e281a01e0e0a8b9500dfa131ec2dc7e7540024/331_0_3472_3472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fan holds a sign of support for England prior to the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022 Quarter Final match between England and Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fan holds a sign of support for England prior to the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022 Quarter Final match between England and Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Lander/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Fans at Brighton &amp; Hove Community Stadium ahead of kick-off.

Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>GOAL! England 3-0 Sweden (Russo 68)</strong></p> <p><strong>68min</strong> Alessia Russo has scored the most outrageous goal! This is spine‑tingling stuff! Walsh and Kirby sliced Sweden apart, with Kirby putting the chance on a plate for Russo. She hit her shot straight at Lindahl, when she should have scored. Thank goodness she didn’t, because what happened next was incredible. Russo charged after the rebound, muscled Seger off the ball and produced a sudden backheel that went through the legs of the keeper. That is an amazing goal.</p> <p><strong>71min</strong> I’m still reeling from that goal. The imagination, the chutzpah, and the noise – a different kind of roar, a delirious fusion of “Get in!” and “WTF!”</p> <p><strong>GOAL! England 4-0 Sweden (Kirby 77)</strong></p> <p><strong>77min</strong> I think it’s safe to say that England are going to Wembley. Fran Kirby, who has been close to her mischievous best tonight, gets in on the act. It came from a throw-in on the right, with Mead poking a quick, clever pass into the path of Kirby as she ran beyond the defence. Kirby curled a first‑time chip over Lindahl, who got two hands on the ball but could only push it over her head and into the net. <br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/jul/26/england-v-sweden-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-live?filterKeyEvents=false\">Rob Smyth</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"de8f564b094ce23ab55ea6c061e2671239e04f8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de8f564b094ce23ab55ea6c061e2671239e04f8b/0_0_7909_5273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England fans cheer as the England coach goes past ahead of the Women’s Euro 2022 semi-final between England and Sweden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England fans cheer as the England coach goes past ahead of the Women’s Euro 2022 semi-final between England and Sweden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"0aab8eab09454d0cf119361b28c9ca7ac671e105\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0aab8eab09454d0cf119361b28c9ca7ac671e105/578_211_2207_2207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England fans enjoy the pre-match atmosphere at Bramall Lane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England fans enjoy the pre-match atmosphere at Bramall Lane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Howarth/CameraSport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"52ffa99c6f298c75e60feae61849b90fd1af7cb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52ffa99c6f298c75e60feae61849b90fd1af7cb2/896_17_3537_3537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans at the screening of the UEFA Women’s EURO 2022 match between England and Sweden in Trafalgar Square, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans at the screening of the EURO 2022 match between England and Sweden in Trafalgar Square, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"05513f091d65310d05e20b7538d66405ccc5049a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05513f091d65310d05e20b7538d66405ccc5049a/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweden fans sing and march to Bramall Lane stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweden fans sing and march to Bramall Lane stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>England fans cheer as the England coach goes past; fans at Bramall Lane and Trafalgar Square enjoy the pre-match atmosphere; Swedish fans make their way to Bramall Lane.

Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</p></li> </ul> <p>Ecstasy. Records tumbled, emotions raged and hearts burst as England, with a first international goal from Chloe Kelly, defeated the eight-time champions Germany to secure a first major trophy for the Lionesses – and England’s first since 1966.</p> <p>Ella Toone’s stunning second-half chip over Merle Frohms looked to have been enough but Lina Magull’s 79th‑minute strike forced extra time. With penalties looming ominously, Kelly pounced, turning in from close range to steal the headlines after battling back from an anterior cruciate ligament injury that ended her Olympic dream and threatened her European one. Whipping her shirt off in celebration, replicating the historic image of the USA forward Brandi Chastain in the 1999 Women’s World Cup final that helped the game explode in the US, Kelly pointed to the revolution that the Lionesses have kickstarted in England.</p> <p>From there, buoyed by the goal and the raucous crowd, England pushed to put on a show and seal the deal. It was gutsy, exhausting and exhilarating, tears flowed and England brought it home. <br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report\">Suzanne Wrack</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12fb60d3f601988fbcf4700abc816aaa08e30a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12fb60d3f601988fbcf4700abc816aaa08e30a62/0_0_8025_5350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans before the Euro 2022 final between England and Germany at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans before the Euro 2022 final between England and Germany at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1645b56f7c4f304e96417549139ba3f8e023a690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1645b56f7c4f304e96417549139ba3f8e023a690/175_0_2670_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A potential handball from Leah Williamson of England Women was referred to VAR but no penalty was given.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A potential handball from Leah Williamson of England Women was referred to VAR but no penalty was given.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cda284970ca3822df922598144744826e5664625\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cda284970ca3822df922598144744826e5664625/0_0_3500_1783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Ella Toone scores their first goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"509\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Ella Toone scores their first goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Fans raise the temperature before kick-off; a first-half scare for England when a potential handball from Leah Williamson was referred to VAR but no penalty was given; England’s Ella Toone finishes deftly for their first goal … and fans in Berlin react; the German players and fans in Wembley celebrate after Lina Magull scores their equaliser.

As during the global financial crisis that took hold that year, economies face the prospect of deep recessions but oil companies are reaping record profits. BP on Tuesday became the latest in the procession to post bumper results, with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/02/bp-profits-oil-prices-ukraine-war-energy-prices-cost-of-living-crisis\">best quarter since record earnings</a> in 2008, just as the financial system collapsed.</p> <p>This time around, the finances of the oil and gas giants have benefited from the higher prices resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, just as consumers in the UK and elsewhere face sky high energy bills and a broader cost of living crisis.</p> <p>There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/bp-oil-shell-profit-regulation\">calls for windfall taxes</a> back in 2008, as now, but some things have changed. The climate emergency has risen up the agenda, and been signed into law. That has forced oil companies into investments in renewable energy and other net zero-compatible projects that would have been laughed out of a supermajor’s boardroom in previous decades. Even the US giants ExxonMobil and Chevron – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/30/exxonmobil-lobbyists-oil-giant-carbon-tax-pr-ploy\">laggards in an industry of laggards</a> – have been forced to admit begrudgingly that some form low-carbon technologies are going to be necessary.</p> <p>BP chief executive Bernard Looney knows how to talk the talk. Speaking to analysts on Tuesday he repeatedly highlighted BP’s lower-carbon investments. On their own they can make for impressive reading – BP is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/28/bp-buys-uks-biggest-electric-car-charger-network-for-130m\">leader in UK electric car charging</a>, for instance – but a quick look at oil company investments makes for less flattering reading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-02-03:52:26/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Profits chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-02-03:52:26/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Alok Sharma, a member of the UK cabinet (albeit a lame-duck one), on Tuesday highlighted a comparison between BP’s share buybacks, worth $3.5bn (£2.9bn) this quarter alone, and its planned spending on low-carbon energy for the whole year of $2.5bn. We should be able to “see if their actions match their rhetoric”, he wrote.</p> <p>BP, its FTSE 100 rival Shell, the US companies ExxonMobil and Chevron, and France’s Total between them made underlying profits of nearly $100bn in the first half of 2022 – triple their earnings in the same period in 2021. The same companies have so far announced shareholder returns (via dividends and share buybacks) for this year worth $52bn – more than half their profits for the first half.</p> <p>Returning money to shareholders can have upsides for the broader population, as savers and pension funds will be large beneficiaries. But share ownership is dominated by the wealthiest, and a stream of dividends will do very little indeed to help poorer households in the UK or elsewhere cope with soaring energy prices.</p> <p>Energy prices will remain high up the political agenda around the world. The issue is likely to be at the top of the in-tray for the UK’s new prime minister once the Conservative party chooses between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. The average energy bill in Great Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/energy-bills-great-britain-winter-discount\">could reach more than £3,600 a year</a> this winter, according to the latest estimates.</p> <p>Shell’s boss, Ben van Beurden, last week said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/an-insult-soaring-profits-at-shell-and-centrica-cause-outrage\">“cannot perform miracles”</a> to bring on new energy supply and lower bills for households. But the history of renewable energy technology – such as the astonishing increase in wind and solar power as costs fell – suggests that miracles are not necessary: what is required is the will to invest in a speedier transition.</p> <p>Finance bosses are taught that they should return cash to shareholders when they are unable to make more money themselves with new investments. The pace of buybacks and dividends during 2022 suggests that oil companies are content to hand more cash to investors rather than invest more to speed up the net zero transition.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/austria-doctors-demand-more-protection-lisa-maria-kellermayr-death","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T14:55:13Z","webTitle":"Austrian doctors speak out after suicide of GP following Covid threats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/austria-doctors-demand-more-protection-lisa-maria-kellermayr-death","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/austria-doctors-demand-more-protection-lisa-maria-kellermayr-death","fields":{"headline":"Austrian doctors speak out after suicide of GP following Covid threats","trailText":"Lisa-Maria Kellermayr was targeted by conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers before taking her own life","byline":"Kate Connolly in Berlin","body":"<p>Austrian medical representatives have called for greater protection for doctors after a GP who faced months of violent threats from anti-vaccination activists and pandemic conspiracy theorists took her own life.</p> <p>Lisa-Maria Kellermayr was found dead in her practice in the lakeside resort of Seewalchen am Attersee on Friday. Prosecutors told the media they found three suicide notes and were not planning to carry out an autopsy.</p> <p>Her death prompted a wave of vigils and demonstrations. There have also been calls for laws against bullying and psychological warfare to be tightened, including making it easier to prosecute perpetrators in other EU countries, after at least two of the people believed to have targeted Kellermayr with death threats were identified as coming from Germany.</p> <p>Thousands of people gathered outside St Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna on Monday evening and across the country to pay tribute to Kellermayr, 36, in candlelight vigils. Many participants wore pink, her favourite colour.</p> <p>The Austrian president, Alexander Van der Bellen, led the tributes, laying flowers outside Kellermayr’s practice and appealing for an end “to this intimidation and fear-mongering”.</p> <p>Kellermayr was described by her friends, family and patients as a passionate, caring and plain-speaking doctor who lived for her work. At the start of the pandemic, she volunteered to visit coronavirus patients in their homes for weeks of round-the-clock shifts, telling her friends and family that as a single person with no dependants, “I belong on the frontline”.</p> <p>She was one of the earliest people to share her observations that patients who used asthma inhalers were often better able to deal with the symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>Kellermayr was also an enthusiastic supporter of vaccines, sharing her thoughts and ideas on Twitter, and was interviewed regularly, earning praise for her clear communication.</p> <p>However, she drew a wave of hate mail after tweeting her fury when, in November 2021, anti-vaccination demonstrators and supporters of the “Querdenker” coronavirus conspiracy theory movement surrounded a clinic she had worked at in nearby Wels and blocked a main entrance used by emergency vehicles.</p> <p>Kellermayr urged the police to offer her protection, but she claimed they did not take her situation seriously and she employed a security guard to stand outside her practice and check patients before they entered.</p> <p>The guard told German and Austrian media in February that he had frequently turned people away and removed several butterfly knives from others who entered the practice. </p> <p>Kellermayr said in June she had spent €100,000 (£84,000) on security costs, adding: “It would be cheaper to shut the practice and to fly to the South Pacific with my staff.” Last month, she said she had been forced to close her practice for good.</p> <p>In her final interview, with the respected Austrian daily Der Standard, Kellermayr said she felt abandoned by the Austrian state. “What has happened to me can happen to any citizen who is not well known or is not well connected,” she said.</p> <p>Police in Germany, meanwhile, told Kellermayr that they were unable to act against a man who was sending her threats because his messages were sent from the darknet, to which they had no access.</p> <p>But reporters from Der Standard said they had little difficulty in tracing the suspect to the Berlin area, identifying him as a figure from the neo-Nazi scene. Journalists also managed to trace a man from Upper Bavaria who had threatened to put Kellermayr before a “tribune of the people”, accusing her of treason.</p> <p>Austrian police have rejected the claim that they failed to take the threats against Kellermayr seriously. A spokesperson for the Upper Austrian police, who had previously urged Kellermayr to “stay out of the limelight”, told the Austrian agency APA: “We have been in constant contact with the doctor since November and have tried to offer her protection. We did everything that was possible with regards to security as well as investigating [the threats].” Investigations are continuing, he said.</p> <p>The vigils on Monday were supported by the Austrian government, including the health minister, Johannes Rauch, who said he was “deeply shocked” by Kellermayr’s death.</p> <p>He said: “Hatred against people is inexcusable. This hatred must finally stop.”</p> <p>Johannes Steinhart, the president of the Austrian Medical Association, urged doctors to join the vigils “in order to send a forceful message for solidarity and against violence and hatred”. Hundreds of doctors and medical staff attended, as well as scientists involved in fighting the pandemic.</p> <p>Austria’s government last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/23/austria-scraps-compulsory-covid-vaccine-mandate\">abandoned controversial plans</a> to bring in compulsory coronavirus vaccinations for adults, which had led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/austria-suspends-mandatory-covid-vaccination-law\">nationwide protests</a>.</p> <p>Ministers said they came to the conclusion that this would do little to raise one of western Europe’s lowest vaccination rates and that it threatened to exacerbate the social divide over the public health strategy around the virus.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

This is a 20% drop since the first lockdown in March 2020.</p> <p>There were 1,446 nightclubs in Britain in December 2019 and 1,924 in December 2014, according to figures collected by the data and research consultancy firm CGA.</p> <p>The “culmination of pandemic debt, growing energy bills, workforce challenges, supply chain issues, insurance premiums and landlord pressures” have contributed to slowing ticket sales and visitor frequency at these venues, the NTIA said.</p> <p>The trade body also warned that the true impact of cost inflation on businesses was yet to be seen, with more than 53.8% of respondents still to renew energy contracts.</p> <p>Some parts of Britain were worse hit than others, such as the Midlands, where nearly 30% of nightclubs have closed since March 2020.</p> <p>When broken down, the region that experienced the biggest percentage drop (28%) in the number of nightclubs since December 2019 was central England and central Wales, followed by the south-east outside London (27%) and the south-west (27%).

Indeed, it can be hard to get a handle on what we even mean by shopping any more. Is it primarily an activity conducted hunched in front of a laptop screen? Or on a mobile phone? Is it dominated by chain shops in giant shopping malls as local high streets wither and die? Or, on the contrary, is it characterised by a recent renaissance of local independent retailers and original brands – a kind of rewilding of the natural retail ecosystem.</p> <p>While the pandemic caused a huge surge in online shopping, it also prompted a resurgence of local shopping as customers sought a retail experience that was more sustainable, more experiential, more local and simply more human. A <a href=\"https://www.gekko-uk.com/research/the-great-british-retail/\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey</a> by marketing agency Gekko revealed the yearning that people had for the “human” factor that had been absent during lockdowns. What 62% of respondents missed most about physical shopping was the ability to see, hold and try a product, while 52% missed the ability to browse, and 52% were pining for the sheer enjoyment of shopping.</p> <p>These yearnings are unlikely to be short-lived: indeed, the trend for more independent and sustainable retailers predated the pandemic. “Retail over recent years has been an incredibly challenging industry,” says Laura Morroll, director at management consultancy BearingPoint. “We’ve witnessed former big brand retailers disappear from our high streets, and consumer choice diminishing. Independent brands and independent retailers should be well placed to offer the choice and variety that customers are craving.”</p> <p>Independent shops typically have a knack for creating special experiences for customers in search of original and authentic products. Their ability to attract shoppers also reinforces a growing sense of community in their local areas. In many respects, the revival of local and independent commerce is a return to a more natural retail ecosystem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68a31f5118c359697291b909646190f9243a5cf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68a31f5118c359697291b909646190f9243a5cf8/0_0_5903_4083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior shot of shop Jumping Bean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jumping Bean, an independent store selling lifestyle products, has thrived off a community-first approach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ella McManus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I believe that we are at a pivotal moment for the independent retailer,” says Andrew Goodacre, CEO of the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira). “Faceless corporate behemoths are going to lose out to them because they truly understand their demographics, the local culture in which they operate, and the wants and needs of the customer.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, getting the right brands into their stores can be a challenge for independent retailers. For instance, they might increasingly find themselves competing on more intangible factors than price – such as discovery, authenticity, quirkiness, and the ability of well-sourced products to elevate the shopping experience.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/how-retail-got-real/2022/aug/02/brand-building-three-entrepreneurs-on-how-they-perfected-their-wares\">Brand building: three entrepreneurs on how they perfected their wares</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Shoppers are now far more aware of and pleasantly surprised by what is available locally; different, high-quality, diverse products that still offer great value,” says Goodacre. “To meet this demand, we encourage our retailers to look for those unique products from respected brands, and online marketplaces are a good place to start.”</p> <p>B2B marketplaces provide independent brands, makers and designers with an opportunity to stand out, while helping retailers discover and work with new brands that best suit their targeted audience.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ankorstore.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ankorstore</a> is a B2B marketplace that connects independent brands with retailers, florists, coffee shops, and other concept stores, allowing them to sell a more varied range of stock than large retail chains. Founded by four French e-commerce entrepreneurs, Ankorstore aims to reinvent the wholesale model, on the retail side and the brand side, helping both to be more creative and real. It helps retailers manage their portfolio of brands in one place – giving them more time to focus on the business rather than admin – and increase margins by saving on shipping and customs. Brands can accelerate their wholesale business thanks to a wider reach across the EU, which allows them to compete with e-commerce behemoths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d76310fb43aa744df645159a120b1e16d3f2fd5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76310fb43aa744df645159a120b1e16d3f2fd5f/0_0_3750_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eco Friendly Sustainable Products by Jungle Culture\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jungle Culture’s responsibly sourced goods are created by artisans around the world</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: N/A</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some 30,000 brands across Europe, spanning a wide range of business sectors, are registered on the platform, including <a href=\"https://www.ankorstore.com/search?q=jungle%20culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jungle Culture</a>.

Chester-based <a href=\"https://www.bloomandalbion.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloom &amp; Albion</a> offers a range of home and kitchen accessories, skincare products, and arts and crafts, and includes a Makers’ Space for artists and makers within its Grade I-listed premises. <a href=\"https://curiouserandcuriouser.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curiouser and Curiouser</a>, based in Edinburgh, has two gift shops selling a range of products, from illustrative prints to jewellery and homeware.</p> <p>Of course, independent retailers cannot always compete with the speed and low price of the e-commerce giants. If you urgently need something delivered the next day, or sooner, the big e-commerce platforms still remain in a league of their own. But when it comes to the shopping experience, an afternoon spent exploring the high street’s independent offerings, with their vibrant window displays, stylish goods and original gift ideas has an appeal that is hard to beat. And while customers might “transact” and “order” products online, the independent human experience will likely come to define what we mean when we talk about “shopping”.</p> <p><em>To find out more or register with Ankorstore, visit <a href=\"https://www.ankorstore.com/?utm_source=Marketing+UK&amp;utm_medium=Guardiandisplay&amp;utm_campaign=GPartnership\" rel=\"nofollow\">ankorstore.com</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"how-retail-got-real/2022/aug/02/brand-building-three-entrepreneurs-on-how-they-perfected-their-wares","type":"article","sectionId":"how-retail-got-real","sectionName":"How retail got real","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T14:42:05Z","webTitle":"Brand building: three entrepreneurs on how they perfected their wares","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/how-retail-got-real/2022/aug/02/brand-building-three-entrepreneurs-on-how-they-perfected-their-wares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/how-retail-got-real/2022/aug/02/brand-building-three-entrepreneurs-on-how-they-perfected-their-wares","fields":{"headline":"Brand building: three entrepreneurs on how they perfected their wares","trailText":"Sourcing unique products and finding compatible suppliers is increasingly vital for new businesses","byline":"Emma Sheppard","body":"<p>The renaissance of independent retailers and brands has provided rich pickings for shops and producers that want to connect and do business with each other. Here are the stories of some that have teamed up via Ankorstore, an online platform designed as a B2B marketplace.</p> <p><strong>‘It opens up a whole new world’<br></strong>Sophie McEwan started her retail business <a href=\"https://www.quinceandcook.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quince &amp; Cook</a> online in 2014. But she and husband Neil kept the dream of turning it into a physical store alive. Finally, after years of saving and a six-month delay caused by Covid, they opened the doors to their first shop in October 2020 in Perth, Scotland. “We’ve been working our socks off ever since but it’s been going really well. Our local community has been incredibly supportive, coming in and keeping us going,” says Sophie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7312d7f1bd0e5026fbb2c4420dcdfd1b57012b15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7312d7f1bd0e5026fbb2c4420dcdfd1b57012b15/0_0_2654_2671/994.jpg\" alt=\"Quince & Cook store, Perth\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quince &amp; Cook opened its first bricks-and-mortar store in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Segaud Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keeping an ever-changing selection of interesting products is something Sophie prides herself on, but the lack of in-person trade fairs during the Covid-19 pandemic made it much harder to discover new makers. That’s where <a href=\"https://www.ankorstore.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ankorstore</a> came in. “It’s almost like an online trade show. There’s a huge selection and you can buy in small quantities too, which gives me the flexibility to keep trying different brands.” And if you’re not happy with anything, you just send it back, she adds. “You’re not left in the lurch or stuck with stock that isn’t living up to expectations.” She now orders about 50% of her shop’s stock from Ankorstore.</p> <p>As with any new business, cashflow has been difficult to manage, particularly because many of the independent brands Quince &amp; Cook stocks have to be paid in advance. Working with Ankorstore is different, as it offers 60-day payment terms. “There’s a brand called Miniml that we stock in the refill shop. We’ve bought from them for years but they don’t offer credit. Now they’ve signed up on Ankorstore, which is fantastic because it means we don’t have to pay for orders upfront.” The platform has also made it easier to discover smaller brands that wouldn’t have been able to afford to attend trade shows, and independent makers from Europe and North America. “It opens up a whole new world, so you can mix and match to create something truly unique and curated.”</p> <p><strong>‘I didn’t expect them to be so helpful’<br></strong>After a long career as a special needs teacher, Caroline Bee was walking along a Cornish beach when she resolved to do something about the rubbish that was washing up on the shore. Coupled with some volunteering experience at a nearby bee centre and a previous art and design degree, she was inspired to create a range of reusable beeswax food wraps to sell at local markets. <a href=\"https://beeretro.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bee Retro</a> was born. “We officially launched in 2019 and that year was amazing. The wraps were really well received and we booked into as many festivals and fairs as we could,” says Bee. “Then Covid hit.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/how-retail-got-real/2022/aug/02/have-faith-people-will-love-what-you-do-startup-founders-reveal-seven-tips-for-success\">‘Have faith people will love what you do’: startup founders reveal seven tips for success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She pivoted to making cotton face masks to see her through the pandemic, started to stock other people’s products on her stalls (such as bamboo straws and plastic-free lunchboxes), and looked at expanding the business’s trade channels so she wasn’t so reliant on selling direct to the customer. One of the brands she buys stock from recommended Ankorstore. “I’m not on the internet a lot so it’s proved to be a really good way of selling,” says Bee. “I didn’t expect them to be so helpful. I’ve got my own brand manager and we meet every two weeks to see how I can keep my sales up. She’s been amazing.”</p> <p>She’s still doing the occasional trade show but will use Ankorstore to push orders through. One thing that’s surprised her most about becoming an entrepreneur is where the interest comes from. Bee Retro beeswax wraps are now stocked in locations as varied as a zoo and an airport. “You just have to find your fit,” she adds. “And it’s not always the fit you think it’s going to be when you start out.”</p> <p><strong>‘They align with my values’<br></strong>Katy Davies had always wanted to start her own business. But it wasn’t until she was furloughed from her job in international development during the pandemic that she had the time or impetus to do something about it. “Sat in the garden during that glorious summer, I thought it’s now or never, really,” she says. “I treated it a bit like a sabbatical from work. I spent the whole summer researching and finding out what kind of brand it would be. I wanted it to be something meaningful.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8753effc8a1ae997f8b2c0b4511c59b3c439a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8753effc8a1ae997f8b2c0b4511c59b3c439a6e/456_0_2736_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ecojiko’s pot scrubbers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pot scrubbers made from bamboo are just one of a range of plastic-free products sold by Ecojiko</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: N/A</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She founded <a href=\"https://www.ecojiko.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ecojiko</a> in late 2020. The online, plastic-free shop sells products such as a zero-waste kitchen starter kit, and customisable pot scrubbers and dish brushes. “My partner is a bit of a tech whiz and built a laser engraver. That really got us noticed.” When Davies was diagnosed with breast cancer last October, she released a range of pot scrubbers called “<a href=\"https://www.ecojiko.co.uk/collections/brushes/products/boob-scrubbers-donation-on-every-sale\" rel=\"nofollow\">boob scrubbers</a>”, to provide a visual reminder for women to check themselves regularly and raise money for CancerCare. “I kept it hidden for a while,” she says of her diagnosis. “But the pot scrubbers have been really popular and it’s heartwarming to share stories with other brands and stockists.”</p> <p>When making plans to grow the business, she considered linking up with an e-commerce giant, but chose not to because “it didn’t align with my values,” she says. She was then approached by Ankorstore and has been impressed with its support for small independent brands. “They’re really proactive and have given me lots of advice about how to build sales, how to display the brand, run promotions, create bundles, etc. The dashboard is really good too and makes it easy to control orders and arrange shipping.” Her account manager also provided assistance when navigating new export rules after Brexit, and Ecojiko now has stockists in France and Scandinavia. “We have about 180 stockists around the world. And it’s built our network with other brands too. It’s full-steam ahead.”</p> <p><em>To find out more or register with Ankorstore, visit <a href=\"https://www.ankorstore.com/?utm_source=Marketing+UK&amp;utm_medium=Guardiandisplay&amp;utm_campaign=GPartnership\" rel=\"nofollow\">ankorstore.com</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2022/aug/02/whats-my-future-millennials-and-gen-z-grapple-with-cost-of-living-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T14:41:09Z","webTitle":"‘What’s my future?’: millennials and Gen-Z grapple with cost of living crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/02/whats-my-future-millennials-and-gen-z-grapple-with-cost-of-living-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/02/whats-my-future-millennials-and-gen-z-grapple-with-cost-of-living-crisis","fields":{"headline":"‘What’s my future?’: millennials and Gen-Z grapple with cost of living crisis","trailText":"Majority of UK young people in low-income households going without essentials while others use savings to pay bills","byline":"Geneva Abdul","body":"<p>Like many people across the UK, Luke Downham, 26, has found himself living pay day to pay day as the cost of living crisis intensifies.</p> <p>During the pandemic, he was able to save money and pay off student debt.

According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/not-heating-eating-or-meeting-bills-managing-cost-living-crisis-low-income\">more than 70% of low-income households with an 18- to 24-year-old</a> were in arrears with at least one household bill, and more than 80% of with an 18- to 34-year-old are going without essentials.</p> <p>“We may see more young adults having to move home, particularly if you’re falling into things like rent arrears or unable to pay energy bills and so on, which we’re seeing a lot of at the moment – particularly young households not being able to afford the electricity and gas bills,” said Rachelle Earwaker, a senior economist at JRF.</p> <p>Some individuals the Guardian spoke to said they had dipped into savings to make ends meet, or have changed habits such as walking to work instead of driving to save on rising petrol prices. As rents and energy bills increase, many said they could no longer afford to rent on their own, or save for housing deposits, and have moved in with family or roommates.</p> <p>The impact can be detrimental to young people’s credit rating and ability to build new skills, education, careers and financial security, said Earwaker.

Here are some top tips on staying the course from people in the know","byline":"Emma Sheppard","body":"<p><strong>Do your research<br></strong>You can wobble on the precipice of starting a business for some time, says Katy Davies, founder of <a href=\"https://www.ecojiko.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ecojiko</a>, a plastic-free online store. It’s important to use that time to research your market, product range and target audience. “There’s a lot of work that goes on before you launch. It’s mainly about trying to find the right product. I got lots of different samples from all over the world,” she says. <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CBI Insights</a> has found 35% of startups fail because they haven’t found a market need, focusing on a problem that’s interesting to solve instead. Once you think you have the right product, start small, adds Davies. “Just buy 100 of one item to test it. We started with our zero-waste kitchen starter kit and it grew from there.”</p> <p><strong>Put yourself out there<br></strong>Caroline Bee says she was “shaking like a leaf” the first time she approached a stockist about her beeswax food wrap brand, <a href=\"https://beeretro.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bee Retro</a>. “But you’ve got to be proactive and have faith that people will love what you do. And the ones that don’t, don’t matter.” Founders should also be open to evolving their target audience, she adds. Originally she was approaching craft shops but has found high-end food shops make much more sense. And there have been surprises, too. “We’re in the Eden Project, Paignton zoo, Newquay airport. It’s not always [who] you think it’s going to be when you start out.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a13b26752df473a4d12182ee1dd57ed00633c42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a13b26752df473a4d12182ee1dd57ed00633c42/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ecojiko brush\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katy Davies took care to find products that aligned with her Ecojiko brand’s values</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: N/A</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Build a network of support<br></strong>It can feel lonely being an entrepreneur. Building a network of other founders and local business support can help push you forward on the days that feel hopeless, Bee says. She’s applied for lots of local grants and worked with business support managers through various startup programmes. “When you’ve got a question and you think your business is going under, it helps to have somewhere there to help you get your head straight again,” she adds. “So seek out that support. It is there and it’s often free.” <a href=\"https://blog.ankorstore.com/ankorstart/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ankorstart</a>, for example, is a free service run by B2B marketplace Ankorstore to support retailers in the early days of business. Ankorstore’s UK general manager, Tarun Gidoomal, says: “Running a business means navigating many complex and ambiguous decisions on a daily basis ... and the burden of responsibility can often feel overwhelming. Here’s the good news: many others are in a similar boat and are willing and able to share their experiences. Seek them out. It helps us feel less alone and brings clarity on what to do.”</p> <p><strong>Move on when you make mistakes<br></strong><a href=\"https://fundsquire.co.uk/startup-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research</a> by Fundsquire, a global startup funding network, found 20% of small businesses fail within their first year and 60% fail within the first three years. But founders shouldn’t become paralysed by a fear of failure says Jina Kwon, deputy general manager and country launcher for Ankorstore UK. “If you’re going to achieve something big, you need to take big risks. With growth comes a huge amount of learning and often that means having to wear many hats beyond your typical area of expertise. When things go wrong, I’ve seen many founders be quite self-critical but it’s important to simply learn from those mistakes and move on. It’s how you deal with problems that defines the moment and keeps the business evolving.” Gidoomal explains he has a mantra: “no mistakes made, only lessons learned” and adds: “I’ve found what differentiates good founders from great founders is not only their ability to experiment, but also their capacity to learn and iterate as quickly as possible.”</p> <p><strong>Stay true to your values<br></strong>Small business founders have the freedom to create a brand that stands for something more than just profit. As Gidoomal explains: “Increasingly, people align to causes, not companies. So be clear about what you stand for and why.

Kwon has seen a real trend towards this type of shopping: “Consumers are moving towards opposite ends of the buying experience to fulfil different needs.

Digital shopping seemed to be turning the element of human interaction into faceless transactions, making shopping more perfunctory. But a renaissance of independent shops and brands – and consumer support for them – has also sparked a resurgence of other intangible things, such as serendipity and community. Here are some of the ways these shifts have affected our everyday lives:</p> <p><strong>Creating a sense of place</strong> <br>The resurgence of independent retailers is breathing new life into communities, creating spaces and a sense of place where customers can experience brands from a variety of makers and designers, from food and fashion to art and lifestyle. Shopping online may have the advantage in terms of speed and convenience, but buying from a small, local store, where you can see, smell, touch, and even taste some of the products on offer creates a physical shopping experience that no amount of e-commerce technology can compete with.</p> <p><strong>More bespoke and quirky products</strong> <br>In a world that’s been dominated by massive chain stores, all designed to look the same, independent retailers bring much-needed originality and variety into shoppers’ lives. These smaller stores can afford to be more selective, whether choosing their suppliers or stocking products from new brands that their customers are unlikely to have seen anywhere else. Through wholesale B2B platforms such as Ankorstore, these retailers can expand their reach to connect with artisan producers, designers and niche brands to generate even greater choice and variety for their customers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"123f3d111414235db05164b7337a7b15d22b5748\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/123f3d111414235db05164b7337a7b15d22b5748/0_356_5700_3422/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of female and male coworkers outside bicycle shop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Independent businesses put a face and story behind your transactions, giving you the chance to build a connection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maskot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Personal customer service</strong> <br>One of the hallmarks of the independent retailer is the level of personal customer service they provide. They are incredibly passionate about their products, they love what they do, and want to share that passion with others. They are also extremely knowledgeable about the brands they are selling, and will happily share the story behind the goods and the people who have created them with their customers. People also want to buy from businesses that make it easy to get help when they need it and will go above and beyond for them, something that independent retail business owners excel at.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/how-retail-got-real/2022/aug/02/rewilding-retail-the-independents-putting-the-human-factor-back-into-shopping\">Rewilding retail: the independents putting the ‘human’ factor back into shopping</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>A sense of community</strong> <br>Long before the existence of shopping malls and online deliveries, shopping locally from small independent retailers, whose owners you got to know personally, was the norm. How many people are on first-name terms with their supermarket manager? Local shops have a huge role to play in what makes a town or city unique, adding character, and a sense of culture and community. Calling in at the local bakery, toy shop, or florist to browse and have a chat with the owner helps to build and strengthen a sense of community and keeps people connected.</p> <p><strong>Supporting new businesses</strong> <br>The last few years have been tough for high street retail, particularly for some of the largest retail brands. But, as chain stores continue to reduce their presence, a new generation of independent retail businesses is stepping into the gaps they’ve left behind. Buying from these businesses demonstrates support for the designers and independent brands whose goods they are selling, and showing that support for entrepreneurship feeds back into the community, generating further opportunities for creativity and innovation. For many customers, there is also a desire to give something back by helping the small independent retailers who’ve struggled in recent times to keep their businesses open.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d7b46bcf3e845d7e25864b6670139299c163f08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d7b46bcf3e845d7e25864b6670139299c163f08/0_1_1733_1040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Back view of woman in casual clothes hanging zero waste sacks on wall near shelves with organic cosmetic in eco friendly shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">By shopping independently, customers can often find products that are one of a kind and more sustainable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Milles Studio/Stocksy United</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Eco-conscious shopping</strong> <br>Shopping locally from independent retailers can also be better for the environment. At a time when everyone is more aware of climate change, increasing numbers of people are becoming sustainable shoppers, buying products that are eco-friendly and responsibly sourced. Independent retailers that use online B2B marketplaces have access to a much wider range of brands and designers offering these types of products. People are more likely to walk, cycle or use public transport to get to their local high street; a greener alternative to online deliveries made by cars and vans to your door. Similarly, packaging is often more economical and sustainable in local shops than in some of the larger corporates and e-commerce firms.</p> <p><strong>Improving health and wellbeing</strong> <br>During lockdown periods, the sense of isolation and the lack of social interaction were leading causes of anxiety and other mental health issues. A return to normality and a resurgence of shopper activity in the local independent retail marketplace could have a positive impact on people’s health and wellbeing. We are social creatures, after all. Ultimately, shopping is the transactional element; what matters is that real-life interaction, and the emotional and personal connection that results from direct communication with the owners of the small independent retail businesses.</p> <p><em>To find out more or register with Ankorstore, visit <a href=\"https://www.ankorstore.com/?utm_source=Marketing+UK&amp;utm_medium=Guardiandisplay&amp;utm_campaign=GPartnership\" rel=\"nofollow\">ankorstore.com</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/02/trump-endorses-eric-greitens-schmitt-missouri-republican-primary","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T14:33:34Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump endorses ‘Eric’ in Missouri primary – but which one?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/trump-endorses-eric-greitens-schmitt-missouri-republican-primary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/trump-endorses-eric-greitens-schmitt-missouri-republican-primary","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump endorses ‘Eric’ in Missouri primary – but which one?","trailText":"Former president hedges his bets in Republican Senate race, where both Eric Greitens and Eric Schmitt claimed his endorsement","byline":"Martin Pengelly in New York","body":"<p>Announcing his long-awaited endorsement in the Republican primary for US Senate in Missouri, the night before polling opened on Tuesday, Donald Trump chose to hedge his bets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/lucas-kunce-populism-missouri-senate-democrat-primary\">Lucas Kunce: ‘Populism is about everyday people coming together’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There is a BIG election in the Great State of Missouri,” the former president said on Monday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/W7VOA/status/1554234124784869376\">adding</a>: “I trust the Great People of Missouri, on this one, to make up their own minds … I am therefore proud to announce that ERIC has my Complete and Total Endorsement!”</p> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/01/trump-greitens-missouri-senate/\">three Erics</a> in the Missouri race.</p> <p>Among the real contenders, according to <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-far-right-will-republican-primary-voters-go-in-arizona-and-missouri/\">polling</a>, are Eric Greitens, a scandal-plagued former governor, and Eric Schmitt, the state attorney general.

Buying their work was seen as risky as they wouldn’t be as committed to their careers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, this is an unfair comparison. For most of human history, women were not allowed to practise art in the same way as men so there are inevitably fewer old mistresses than old masters. But even among living artists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/04/wow-91m-jeff-koons-blow-up-dogs-record-prices-paris-oxford\">Jeff Koons holds the record, at $91m</a>, while the female record held by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/25/jenny-saville-painter-artist-gagosian-gallery-london-interview-charles-saatchi-yba\">Jenny Saville</a> is just $12.5m.</p> <p>And lower down the chain, a 10:1 disparity still holds. Helen Gorrill, the author of <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/women-cant-paint/helen-gorrill/9781501359033\">Women Can’t Paint</a>, has studied the prices of 5,000 paintings sold all over the world and found that for every £1 a male artist earns for his work, a woman earns a mere 10p. “It’s the most shocking gender value gap that I’ve come across in any industry at all,” she told me for a BBC Radio 4 documentary, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0019z2b\">Recalculating Art</a>.</p> <p>It really is shocking.

While the value of a work by a man rises if he has signed it, the value of a work by a woman falls if she has signed it, as if it has somehow been tainted by her gender. “That’s just absolutely mind-blowing,” she says.</p> <p>Let’s get back to quality. Could it be that men are simply better artists? Oxford professor of finance Renée Adams decided to put the idea to the test. She showed participants five paintings by men and five by women and asked them to identify the gender of the artist. They guessed right 50% of the time – no better than tossing a coin. This is pretty good evidence that art by men is no different from, and thus no better than, art by women.</p> <p>Then she showed a sample of affluent men who visit galleries – the classic profile of an art collector – a painting created by AI, and randomly assigned it either a male or female artist’s name. If the collectors were told it was painted by a man they said they liked it more than if they were told it was painted by a woman. As she puts it: “The same artist, the same painting.”</p> <p>How have we got here? Frances Morris, director of Tate Modern, says: “Women artists have fared very poorly because there’s been an unconscious collusion between the marketplace, art history and the institutions. Everybody lacks confidence, everybody’s looking for confirmation. So there’s been a sort of confirmational history, which you could call the canon. And, of course, convention and history were framed by patriarchy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e23c90db3f100e2a62fa8ec9ae7a3166fbe28ae7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e23c90db3f100e2a62fa8ec9ae7a3166fbe28ae7/24_236_1371_1713/800.jpg\" alt=\"Most expensive ever … Salvator Mundi fetched $450m.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most expensive ever … Salvator Mundi fetched $450m.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © 2021 Elk Film Aps</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You only have to look at <a href=\"https://www.phaidon.com/store/art/the-story-of-art-9780714847030?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=11345528337&amp;utm_adgroup=106511706890&amp;utm_keyword=&amp;utm_matchtype=&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw852XBhC6ARIsAJsFPN3se4h98dril_Oul6MHR7J_P22E2lEEN2oL64jsr3XPgXLu1vUEVTUaAv81EALw_wcB\">EH Gombrich’s The Story of Art</a>, still the bestselling art book in the world, assigned to art students everywhere. It mentions just one female artist in its 688 pages. Where is Artemisia Gentileschi? Or Frida Kahlo? Or O’Keeffe? And you only have to look at museum collections to see how disproportionately male they still are. Once an artist has been bought by a museum, the value of their work soars. The same happens if they are given a temporary show.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some female artists have been dropped by galleries as soon as they announced they were pregnant. They were told that people would no longer take their work seriously; that buying their work was too much of a risk because they wouldn’t be as committed to their careers.</p> <p>So female artists are really up against it. The good news is that the world is slowly starting to change. Museums are trying to rebalance their collections. A few are even selling art by men in order to buy more art by women. Auction houses are now pushing female artists, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/24/59th-venice-biennale-2022-review-the-womens-biennale\">the Venice Biennale was hugely weighted towards women this year</a>.</p> <p>Collectors are noticing too. Even though prices for work by female artists are starting from a far lower base, they are currently rising 29% faster than for art by men. For canny investors who want a bargain and a higher return, it’s a no-brainer.</p> <p>What’s more, a lot of this art is great. As Bellatrix Hubert of the David Zwirner gallery in New York, says: “If I’m looking at the artists we’re most interested in right now, it is predominantly women that are making the best art. Or the art that I think is more interesting.”</p> <p>Women can’t paint? Rubbish.

Well, lucky you, there’s an oversized slice of it coming up – prepared entirely at my own expense. Earlier this year, I wrote about how my family had moved from a cramped one-bedroom flat in Manhattan to a spacious terrace house in (far more affordable) Philadelphia. “I have made a very good life choice,” I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/20/ive-left-new-york-and-im-legally-obliged-to-tell-you-about-it\" title=\"\">crowed in a column</a>. And, for a while, that seemed to be the case. We luxuriated in all the new space and marvelled at how quiet our new home was compared with New York. Despite sharing a wall, we couldn’t hear our neighbours at all.</p> <p>There was good reason for that: we didn’t have any neighbours on one side. I thought they had just gone on holiday; however, it soon became clear that the house next door was empty. What’s more, it looked like the tenants had left in a hurry. There was a knocked-over fire pit in the garden, with a piece of half-burnt wood in it. There was a deflated paddling pool hung up to dry on the fence. And, strangest of all, it looked like someone had been digging an odd-shaped hole by the deck. I’ve consumed a lot of true crime in my life; my imagination went wild. Were the neighbours laundering money for the mob? Had they scarpered under cover of darkness because their bosses realised they were embezzling funds? Had they been murdered? Were they lying dead in the basement?</p> <p>It turns out the truth was far worse. A little sleuthing revealed that the house was owned by a property developer (he describes himself online as a “maverick”) who had a permit to turn it into apartments. That meant demolishing the interior of the original house and adding a three-storey addition in the back garden. Nice for him, I suppose. Not so nice for my toddler’s nap schedule or, since I work from home, my sanity. I mentioned these concerns when the developer showed up at our door a few weeks ago to tell us that demolition was about to start. “Ah, it won’t be so bad,” he said. “This project is bringing up the neighbourhood!” He then hopped in his car and fled the neighbourhood.</p> <p>My (annoyingly well-adjusted) wife and I deal with stress in different ways. She blocks out stressors. I open the door as wide as it will go for them, and say: “Hi, so glad to see you! Let’s get to know each other better.” While she went on with her business, ignoring the fact that we were going to have nonstop noise next door for the foreseeable future, I immersed myself in Philadelphia construction laws. In England, you need to jump through quite a few hoops to do such extensive work when you share a party wall with someone, and take steps to ensure the safety of your neighbour’s property. In Philadelphia, however, homeowners have very few rights when it comes to adjacent construction. Your only real option is hiring a lawyer and suing the developer if your house sustains damage during the process.</p> <p>That, by the way, is <a href=\"https://hiddencityphila.org/2019/06/homeowners-pay-the-price-when-new-construction-damages-neighboring-rows/\" title=\"\">horribly common</a>. Philadelphia is full of old terrace homes and there have been a frightening number of cases of houses falling down because of cavalier developers. We live around the corner from a house that made the news because residents had to vacate in a hurry a few months ago, after developers compromised the building when doing demolition work next door.</p> <p>The spate of collapses means that the city of Philadelphia is <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/real-estate/construction-accident-demolition-excavation-philadelphia-city-council-20210616.html\" title=\"\">finally putting laws into effect</a> next year that provide some protection to homeowners from adjacent development. Alas, that doesn’t really help me now: my living room is shaking and the noise is driving me up the wall; my only recourse is noise-cancelling headphones and wine. Still, I have to keep reminding myself, I am the mum of a toddler, I’m used to noise. When you have lived through Baby Shark on repeat for the 90th time, you can live through anything.</p> <p>• Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/02/un-american-girl-how-beyonce-uses-the-power-of-pleasure-to-transcend-a-country-on-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T14:30:35Z","webTitle":"‘Un-American girl’: how Beyoncé uses the power of pleasure to transcend a country on fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/02/un-american-girl-how-beyonce-uses-the-power-of-pleasure-to-transcend-a-country-on-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/02/un-american-girl-how-beyonce-uses-the-power-of-pleasure-to-transcend-a-country-on-fire","fields":{"headline":"‘Un-American girl’: how Beyoncé uses the power of pleasure to transcend a country on fire","trailText":"The star’s new album Renaissance weaves Black dance music history, feminism and queer thought into an ecstatic masterpiece that defies marginalisation","byline":"Daphne A Brooks","body":"<p>Oh, to be an “un-American girl” in the year of our Lord 2022. One of the greatest pop stars of all time knows only she has the juice, the genius and the audacity to seize this middle-fingers-in-the-air moniker on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/b2xLsCo8zmQ\">I’m That Girl</a>, the “still pimpin’”, mystical prologue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyoncé</a>’s latest masterpiece, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/29/beyonce-renaissance-review-joyous-soundtrack-to-a-hot-girl-summer\">Renaissance</a>. The track immediately reacquaints us with versions of Beyoncé we met on her 2016 watershed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/26/beyonce-lemonade-jay-z-becky-pop-culture\">Lemonade</a>: Beyoncé the outlaw, the bandit, the baller; a sister who is “indecent”, “such a heathen”, “thuggin’” for her “un-American life”. But whereas Lemonade boldly and allusively traced the fuel for her errantry (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/08/beyonce-formation-black-american-narrative-the-margins\">armed with a baseball bat</a>, no less) all the way back to the historical nightmare of slavery and its lasting systemic problems – broken Black intimacies, alienated lovers, fractured families and generations of Black women left behind to clean up the mess – her seventh studio album paints a portrait of a dancefloor rebel-with-a-cause whose joyous uncoupling with what it means to be “American” <em>right now</em><strong> </strong>demands that we redefine that word altogether.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dbb164927be82026b68722d4aae40cd64c5e05df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbb164927be82026b68722d4aae40cd64c5e05df/0_0_2250_4000/563.jpg\" alt=\"‘A cosmos of Black ecstatic wonder and eroticism, drama and exploration, libidinal role play and fierce, funky play.’\" width=\"563\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A cosmos of Black ecstatic wonder and eroticism, drama and exploration, libidinal role play and fierce, funky play.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mason Poole</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To be “un-American” in Beyoncé’s Renaissance age is to be “comfortable in my skin”, as she sings on the slinky Chicago house banger Cozy. The song features trans icon Ts Madison’s soundbite <a href=\"https://youtu.be/l6gJ6Uxi6es\">“Black as I want to be”</a> and a verse that not only sets out to “paint the world pussy pink”, but drench it in the colours of <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-progress-pride-flag\">Daniel Quasar’s expansive Progress Pride rainbow flag</a>. If, in other words, to be “American” in 2022 means living in everyday physical, social, political and existential peril as Black and Brown peoples, as women, trans and queer peoples – and especially as Black and Brown queer folk – then count her out. Beyoncé knows, like the rest of us in the margins, that curating a radical life is a “litany for survival”, as the late Black feminist poet and essayist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/18/my-hero-audre-lorde-jackie-kay\">Audre Lorde</a> put it. Conceptually, Renaissance leans into this tradition of queer-of-colour thought forged by scholars influenced by Lorde and her generation of thinkers (Rod Ferguson, Kara Keeling, Tavia Nyong’o, Marlon Ross, Jafari Allen, Madison Moore, to name but a few): folks who have excavated and championed alternative sites of plenitude and pleasure in the face of intersectional violence and exclusion. As Keeling notes of pop empress Donna Summer (who Beyoncé references on Renaissance’s closing track) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/02/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-4-donna-summer-i-feel-love\">I Feel Love</a>, this queer freedom music is rooted in ecstasy, “whose root comes from the Greek ekstasis, meaning ‘standing outside oneself’. It transduces one into more than one, <em>someone</em> who is <em>many</em>. They.”</p> <p>Beyoncé’s summer soundtrack is the welcome antidote to our current epoch: a season in which six unelected jurists of the US supreme court told women and people with uteruses that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court\">our bodies are not our own</a>. It is the third year of a pandemic in which we continue to struggle to keep our bodies well and gradually learn how to make contact again with other bodies. There’s no end in sight to the forever fresh and brutal anti-Black, anti-Brown, anti-queer, anti-trans and anti-woman pandemic. Into this midst, Beyoncé has unleashed a reclamation of the pleasure to be found in our own flesh. “She knew how much we needed to dance” is how my colleague Kathryn Lofton, a Yale religious studies scholar, put it when she texted me the night that Renaissance’s intoxicating lead single <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yjki-9Pthh0\">Break My Soul</a> arrived like a spiritual meteor from the sky – one week before the supreme court’s decision to overturn constitutional abortion rights. The Yoncé on this record is still well aware that the world is on fire: despite “votin’ out 45”, you best keep your <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O9rk6ldyFkA\">“energy”</a> up by any means necessary “‘cause them Karens just turned into terrorists”. We are in the mix with her as each track reverberates with layers of lyrical, musical and thematic call-and-response across the expanse of the album. Leaning again and again into the baptismal magic of the beat and the insistence on “looking for something that lives inside me”, she offers up one escape strategy after another to resist and reject America’s habit of attempting to break minoritised peoples.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Each sound is a building block in a seamless, exuberant sonic history of how to live a free life in our Black bodies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nearly a decade since Beyoncé <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/13/beyonce-album-flawless-feminism\">pulled Black feminism explicitly to the centre of her repertoire</a> (on her masterful, self-titled 2013 “surprise” album), Renaissance continues to deepen this resolve as it weds cutting-edge pop experimentation with Black feminist liberation principles that speak to our ever-present precarity. As the devastating body camera footage of Black life devalued, mishandled and brutalised by the state just keeps rolling in the US – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/brianna-grier-georgia-death-patrol-car\">in Georgia just this past week</a> and God knows where next – Beyoncé’s latest album builds a pathway to another plane out of American carnage and into a cosmos of Black ecstatic wonder and eroticism, drama and exploration, libidinal role play and fierce, funky play. The physical body of our heroine is a serious force to be reckoned with here – as a vision of adornment draped in a bedazzled, skin-baring number on the Lady Godiva-meets-Josephine Baker album cover; as a “hypersonic, sex erotic” as she sings on the rapturous <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yrtWLyp5gLI\">Cuff It</a>, a seductive Get Lucky reboot with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nile-rodgers\">Nile Rodgers</a> back in the house alongside the likes of Raphael Saadiq and Sheila E; as a heat conductor capable of “leav[ing] you in a trance”; an effulgent goddess of light so potent that “everything next to me gets lit up, too”.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrtWLyp5gLI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yrtWLyp5gLI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Beyoncé: Cuff It – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Such radiance is the required calling card for any great dance diva who aims to rule the night. Certainly the canonical ones know that glitter and hope are key ingredients of the last half century of contemporary dance music. And Renaissance is awash in everything from Chicago house and Rodgers’ hugely influential 70s sound to Jamaican dancehall (ushered in by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grace-jones\">Grace Jones</a> on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UlbVbKSiTuM\">Move</a>, a captivating cameo steeped in her trademark bravado), Detroit techno, the lush 80s R&amp;B dance pop of Quincy Jones, the 90s pop-house of Robin S; to the 21st-century EDM of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skrillex\">Skrillex</a>, the Nola bounce of Big Freedia and nods to dubstep, electronica and Miami bass. The astonishing versatility and fearless invention of Beyoncé’s vocals threads this all together as her voice moves all over the register map: flirting with the angelic soprano trills and runs of soul angels such as Minnie Riperton and Deniece Williams, revelling in Jones’s bump-and-growl androgyny, gliding coolly through the new-wave android pop of Gary Numan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae\">Janelle Monáe</a> and dominating with her fiercely commanding flow as an MC. It is a voice that contains multitudes, evoking the scale, depths and diversity of Blackness itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d5286895ea874c36efb4e339cef9fd5cccd64de3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5286895ea874c36efb4e339cef9fd5cccd64de3/0_0_2250_2811/800.jpg\" alt=\"‘A critical sermon to her Black girl and women fans.’\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A critical sermon to her Black girl and women fans.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mason Poole</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each sound constitutes a dense building block in a seamless, exuberant sonic history of how to live a free life in our Black bodies in spite of enduring attempts to annihilate them. Black music (and Black art more broadly) has encapsulated this mighty and prodigious pursuit across the centuries in America, dating back to the exquisitely complex sacred music we composed in bonds to the equally sophisticated and rebelliously “profane” music of the blues, innovated by post-emancipated African Americans seizing the will to articulate a full array of human desires, fears, heartaches and dreams.</p> <p>On the extraordinary <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_sZirWKsOBg\">Church Girl</a>, the heart of Renaissance, Beyoncé sings us through that always closer-than-it-seems divide between holy and sexual salvation, letting a sample from gospel greats the Clark Sisters ease us into a thick, filthy groove, an unapologetically raunchy twerk anthem for the ages steeped in catharsis and hard-won self love. “I’m gon’ let go of this body / I’m gonna love on me / Nobody can judge me / But me,” she sings. “I was born free.” Armed with clapbacks at hip-hop misogyny and heaps of virtuosic rap swagger, she delivers a critical sermon to her Black girl and women fans: let go of your inhibitions and jettison the respectability politics first devised by turn-of-the-century Black church women as a coat of armour to withstand the racism and sexism suffered on the regular. Such politics, as many a Black feminist has since noted, swiftly turned into a straitjacket. “Swimmin’ through the oceans of tears we cried,” Beyoncé, the healer, sings as she steps out of the water and assures us: “I ain’t tryna hurt nobody / Tryna bring the life up in your body …”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6FJxoadUE4JNVwWHghBwnb?si=tjWccNyzS9eYgfF2E4DrSQ\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6FJxoadUE4JNVwWHghBwnb?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Renaissance is an irresistible invitation to head out into the thrilling, glorious and sensuous unknown, to fantasise and “levitate” and move passionately alongside one another. “We flying over bullshit,” Beyoncé declares on Honey Dijon’s staccato-driven, futurist track <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e_aT9pAGQo8\">Alien Superstar</a> – all the more reason this gift of an album insists on taking us “higher”, pushing us to imagine going “where nobody’s been”, to an America of our “wild girl” dreams.

In total, about 140 soldiers were held,” added Grebenyuk, who represented the soldiers.</p> <p>In one written testimony sent to Russian prosecutors on 1 August and reviewed by the Guardian, a soldier described how, after refusing to return to the battlefield, he was jailed for more than a week in different cells in the Russian-controlled territory of Luhansk.</p> <p>“As a result of what I believe were tactical and strategic mistakes made by my commanders … and their total disregard for human life … I made the decision not to continue in the military operation,” said Vladimir, a soldier whose name has been changed at his request.</p> <p>Vladimir said he was detained on 19 July and placed in a room with window bars where he was held without food with 25 other soldiers from his unit who also refused to fight.</p> <p>Shortly after, Vladimir said he was transferred to the town of Bryansk in Luhansk, where he was held in a former school, which had been turned into a military base with about 80 other soldiers from different units who had similarly refused to continue participating in the invasion.</p> <p>He said they were guarded there by members of the private military firm Wagner, a notorious organisation that has been accused of committing human rights abuses while fighting alongside the Russian military in Ukraine.</p> <p>“They [Wagner soldiers] told us that mines had been placed outside the military base and that whoever tried to flee would be considered an enemy and shot on the spot,” the soldier wrote.</p> <p>“We were fed once a day at lunchtime. There was no basic hygiene.</p> <p>“The whole time, not a single document was provided that would explain our arrest. We were illegally jailed,” Vladimir wrote, asking the prosecutors to start a criminal investigation into two Russian colonels and a major who he said were responsible for his jailing.</p> <p>Russia’s defence ministry did not respond to the Guardian’s questions for this article.</p> <p>Vladimir said he eventually managed to leave the premises after a military doctor recommended he should be hospitalised for injuries he sustained earlier in the war.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear if other Russian soldiers were still being held in Luhansk.</p> <p>The jailing of the soldiers, which was first reported last week by the independent investigative outlet the <a href=\"https://theins.ru/news/253550\">Insider</a>, adds to the growing evidence that some Russian units in Ukraine continue to

prosecuted or jailed, said Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer who has in the past represented soldiers who refused orders to go to Ukraine.</p> <p>Pointing to that fact, Vladimir wrote: “Military personnel can be deprived of their liberty only in cases strictly specified in Russian law, namely when they are believed to have committed a crime.”</p> <p>The soldier’s jailing also points to Russia’s growing problems with troop availability as the war nears its sixth month.</p> <p>Vladimir said that during his imprisonment, commanders would repeatedly put pressure on soldiers, urging them to change their minds and return to the battlefield.</p> <p>“Some soldiers, under the threat of violence, were simply driven out to unknown destinations, they have not been seen since,” he wrote.</p> <p>Western

The lady is for turning,” a campaign source said, in another pointed reference to Thatcher.</p> <p>Sunak’s spokesperson said the policy showed Truss’s flaws as a candidate. “It demonstrates a lack of serious judgment by setting out plans that would see pay dramatically cut for police, nurses and our armed forces in Cardiff and Canterbury, Teesside and Taunton during a cost of living crisis. It also shows a worrying lack of grip on detail in what is already a woolly economic plan.”</p> <p>After the policy was announced overnight, Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley mayor and a backer of Sunak, said there was no way the figure could be achieved without pay cuts outside London that would hit levelling up.</p> <p>“Actually speechless,” he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenHouchen/status/1554392347693252614?s=20&amp;t=sTK84xulfienHJ1jIOryMA\">tweeted</a>. “There is simply no way you can do this without a massive pay cut for 5.5 million people including nurses, police officers and our armed forces outside London. So much that we’ve worked for in places like Teesside would be undone.”</p> <p>Holden, the MP for North West Durham, said Truss must “dump the policy”, saying the only way savings could be achieved would be pay cuts for doctors and nurses and police officers. Chris Clarkson, the MP for Heywood and Middleton, said: “I’m not sure a promise to cut people’s pay based on where they live will survive first contact with focus groups, let alone reality.”</p> <p>Young, the MP for Redcar, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobYoungMP/status/1554394877101854723?s=20&amp;t=BOOv2atKm9oQsWi7OTjP8w\">tweeted</a>: “Doubt this is the vision of ‘hope’ Penny Mordaunt spoke about yesterday … Hope for Northerners pay being cut?

The policy is believed to have been based on a Taxpayers’ Alliance report that looked across the whole public sector workforce with no exceptions.</p> <p>Signs the policy was in difficulty began on Tuesday morning when Rees-Mogg, a backer of Truss and the minister in charge of civil service efficiencies, said it was “not the plan at the moment” to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/liz-truss-plan-to-cut-11bn-in-whitehall-waste-ludicrous\">cut pay for the wider public sector</a> to make savings of £8.8bn promised by Truss. “The discussion at the moment is around civil servants,” he said.</p> <p>In the original release, which proposed regional pay boards, Truss said she would “tailor pay to the cost of living where civil servants actually work” and this would save up to £8.8bn.</p> <p>Experts have said that figure is not feasible for civil servants alone. Alex Thomas, a programme director at the Institute for Government thinktank, said the whole annual civil service pay bill was about £9bn.</p> <p>Labour said the original plan would have meant a £7.1bn hit to local economies across Yorkshire, the north and the Midlands.

The far right’s Marine Le Pen, who was beaten by Macron in the final vote, wanted to go further, not just scrapping the licence fee but privatising public television and radio in mainland France.</p> <p>The French licence fee is €138 (£115) a year in mainland France and applies to about 27m homes who declare a television set. By comparison, the UK TV licence is £159.</p> <p>The culture minister, Rima Abdul Malak, said the government would in the short term protect public television and radio budgets while drawing up a “roadmap” for the future of public broadcasting. The current bill would, in the short term, allocate a “fraction of VAT” to public broadcasting, at about €3.7bn, which is roughly the amount that the licence fee currently brings in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But senators from several different parties, from right to left, attacked what they called a lack of concrete strategy on how funding would be secured in the long term. Some said they agreed that the licence fee, based on owning a television set, was outdated and “obsolete” and that “French people won’t miss it”. But they warned the bill was rushed and poorly prepared.</p> <p>Jean-Raymond Hugonet of the rightwing party Les Républicains said there was a “problem of timing”; the bill amounted to demagoguery and was pushed through too fast without a public broadcasting strategy. He said: “We had a president who wanted to get re-elected and who proposed something very popular: scrapping a worn-down and unjust tax which no one wanted any more.” Hugonet argued that more work needed to be done on future funding mechanisms.</p> <p>The Socialist senator David Assouline said: “The stakes are high in our society, where there is a large concentration of private channels and foreign platforms, meaning we must strengthen public broadcasting.” He said the culture minister had “hailed the glory” of French public broadcasting yet was “creating the conditions for weakening it”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/spain-puts-limits-on-air-conditioning-and-heating-to-save-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T13:04:47Z","webTitle":"Spain puts limits on air conditioning and heating to save energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/spain-puts-limits-on-air-conditioning-and-heating-to-save-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/spain-puts-limits-on-air-conditioning-and-heating-to-save-energy","fields":{"headline":"Spain puts limits on air conditioning and heating to save energy","trailText":"Rules apply to public and large commercial buildings – but Madrid president says she will not comply","byline":"Sam Jones in Madrid","body":"<p>Spain has announced new energy-saving measures, including limits on air conditioning and heating temperatures in public and large commercial buildings, as it becomes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/russian-gas-crisis-how-are-european-countries-trying-to-save-energy\">latest European country</a> to seek to reduce its energy consumption and its dependence on Russian oil and gas.</p> <p>Under a decree that comes into effect in seven days’ time and applies to public buildings, shopping centres, cinemas, theatres, rail stations and airports, heating should not be set above 19C and air conditioning should not be set below 27C.

For as special and historic as this moment is, it will be a failure if women’s football does not capitalise.</p> <p>Victory on the international stage has the power to change the sport. Much like when the USA 99ers’ World Cup success led to women’s football exploding in the States or the legacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/06/womens-euro-2017-holland-denmark-match-report\">the Netherlands’ 2017 win</a> that has helped participation and attendances increase, alongside the introduction of the first professional Vrouwen Eredivisie, England will need to find its own way to make sure this achievement has a long-lasting effect.</p> <p>How do we make sure of that? Here are six areas that need to be focused on.</p> <h2>Equal early years access</h2> <p>As Ian Wright said so passionately after the Lionesses’ semi-final win over Sweden: “If girls are not allowed to play football in their PE, just like the boys can, what are we doing?”</p> <p>He is not wrong. According to the Football Association’s figures, 63% of schools offer equal access through girls’ football in PE, including only 44% of secondary schools. These barriers are established at key stages in children’s development that will colour their view for years.</p> <p>There is work being done, with one of the headline goals for the <a href=\"https://www.thefa.com/news/2020/oct/19/new-fa-womens-strategy-launched-191020\">FA’s Women’s and Girls’ Football in England strategy</a> being “every primary school-aged girl to have equal access in school and clubs” by 2024.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/mens-game-boom-roadmap-womens-euro-2022\">Men’s football boom offers roadmap and warning for women’s game | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Pathway for participation and diversification</h2> <p>A rise in interest always follows tournament success and the infrastructure must be ready to meet demand. More resources need to be committed at grassroots level and at the lower end of the football pyramid to ensure the focus is not just on elite competitive sport.</p> <p>A strong club pathway is integral, as are increased efforts to reach a more diverse range of communities. This is where the stars of the future will be discovered, while also giving girls and women an outlet to play and enjoy a sport they have been traditionally excluded from.</p> <h2>Building on WSL’s success</h2> <p>Strong domestic leagues are key to international success. A watershed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/mar/22/a-huge-step-forward-wsl-announces-record-breaking-deal-with-bbc-and-sky\">broadcast deal </a>between Sky Sports and the BBC in 2021 has been crucial to getting eyes on the game. However, there is a cost to attendance. The regular Sunday night big-match kick-off time does not suit the average match-going fan.</p> <p>Equally, several stadiums across the league are inadequate. I have a slightly more radical view on this. I believe every team should be playing at their club’s home. Seats may not fill instantly, but if you build it properly, they will come.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a65a488e0e4c35005e3fa94a616bdd900fcd50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a65a488e0e4c35005e3fa94a616bdd900fcd50/0_122_2998_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Mead takes a shot during Arsenal’s WSL game against Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Mead takes a shot during Arsenal’s WSL game against Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Clubs’ marketing + community outreach</h2> <p>I have said in a previous piece that we must use this moment to “market the hell” out of the game. This requires the input of everyone involved and maybe a glance towards other models to see what can be learned.</p> <p>Clubs must up their marketing budgets and community outreach. There is a tendency for complacency in thinking that being a big brand on the men’s side, spectators will automatically come. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/15/casey-stoney-san-diego-pride-month-family-moving-the-goalposts-football-email\">Casey Stoney</a> emphasised how effective NWSL clubs are at getting into their communities and building the foundations. More of this must be done in England.</p> <h2>Media attention</h2> <p>It has so often been the case that after media attention booms for a tournament, it drops off within a few months. Surely the demand that Euro 2022 has created – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/england-victory-in-womens-euro-2022-final-draws-record-tv-audience-of-17m\">17.4 million tuned into the BBC</a> for the final – shows this cannot happen again. Coverage has to be on the game 365 days a year, bringing all of its wonders and troubles to life, so that it can continue to be at the forefront of people’s minds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ead55b9b5e14b4e381286682a3a87985f98c3017\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ead55b9b5e14b4e381286682a3a87985f98c3017/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"How English papers covered the Euro 2022 final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How English papers covered the Euro 2022 final.

However, success must also be achieved at youth level and the continuation of a strong talent pathway.

Every day there seems to be a news story. The Lizzo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/14/lizzo-removes-harmful-ableist-slur-from-new-song-grrrls-after-criticism\">ableist slur</a>, followed by the Beyoncé ableist slur – the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/when-beyonce-dropped-the-same-ableist-slur-as-lizzo-on-her-new-album-my-heart-sank\">exact same one</a> – mere weeks later. The model whose prosthetic leg was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/spain-beach-bodies-ad-edited-out-my-prosthetic-leg-says-british-model\">edited out</a> of a celebratory “beach bodies” advert. The <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2022/08/01/love-island-2022-tasha-ghouris-dad-spoke-to-itv-welfare-team-a-lot-17107256/\">virulent bullying</a> of the deaf Love Island contestant Tasha Ghouri, both on social media and in the villa.</p> <p>Some of the slights have been more subtle, woven into the fabric of the work surrounding them so seamlessly that they could, and probably will, be explained to me by able-bodied people as being perfectly fine, actually. But it was disappointing to see the final episode of Derry Girls – lauded as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/18/derry-girls-finale-review-absolutely-cracker\">a triumph</a>” by reviewers<strong> </strong>– using a disabled cast member as shorthand for a party not being as cool as it first appeared. The Oscar-winning film Coda, although well-meaning, centres on the struggles of an able-bodied person overcoming the great impediment of having a disabled family. In her medieval fable Lapvona, Ottessa Moshfegh, usually an incredible and fearless writer, uses her characters’ disabilities – their “clawed hand”, “unseemly disproportion”, being “misshapen” – as a way of evoking eeriness and discomfort. Able-bodied writers lazily turning to disability for horror is a time-honoured literary tradition, but perhaps we ought to move on.</p> <p>None of the people involved in these unfortunate contretemps would ever admit to the faintest trace of ableism, of course. All of them, almost certainly, would argue they do not have an ableist bone in their body; too often, apologies take the form of “sorry if you were offended”. Lizzo and Beyoncé listened to the criticism and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/01/beyonce-to-change-renaissance-lyric-containing-ableist-slur\">changed their lyrics</a>, and will hopefully learn from their experiences. But whether the hurt is intentional or not, it is still painful when you’re on the receiving end. What is particularly difficult to comprehend is the lack of scrutiny at all levels of the entertainment industry: commissioning editors, producers, publishers and reviewers breezily waved it all through while garlanding the artists with praise.</p> <p>It should not take disability activists to point this out every time. As Audre Lorde <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/951723-whenever-the-need-for-some-pretense-of-communication-arises-those\">wrote in 1984</a>, it is still “the responsibility of the oppressed to teach the oppressors their mistakes … there is a constant drain of energy which might be better used”. For too long, we have let these things slide. As a form of self-preservation we’ve trained ourselves to laugh off inappropriate or thoughtless comments, to see them as “just a joke”. Even if inside it feels as though a dreadful weight is pushing down on you, pointing out that something is causing you pain can feel like spoiling everyone else’s fun, like you’re being overly sensitive and finding offence where there was none.</p> <p>But enough is enough. We need allies to truly care, to shift their thinking and try to see things the way we might. We need them to change the way things are from the inside – to stop intolerance creeping into their work in the first place, not amend things retroactively, too late. What we need, in short, is empathy – not pity, or being put on a pedestal, but to be seen as fully rounded human beings with feelings that can be hurt.</p> <p>In the past year, there have been positive movements in depictions of disability: Rose Ayling-Ellis’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/11/rose-ayling-ellis-year-in-tv-strictly-deaf-child-eastenders\">Strictly Come Dancing win</a>, a genuinely heartwarming moment; the BBC Two drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/21/then-barbara-met-alan-review-a-rollicking-fact-based-drama-with-a-rock-biographys-swagger\">Then Barbara Met Alan</a>, which told the moving story of a group of disability activists; Arthur Hughes, who has radial dysplasia, becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/08/theres-a-truth-to-it-rsc-casts-disabled-actor-as-richard-iii\">first disabled actor</a> to portray Richard III for the RSC (although the privilege of playing an embittered child murderer is perhaps not top of most disabled people’s to-do lists). What we need more of are incidentally disabled casting choices, where the actor’s disability is not the character’s defining feature, or even mentioned at all – as with Daniel Monks in Jamie Lloyd’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/07/the-seagull-review-woodchip-walled-chekhov-is-hypnotic\">recent production</a> of The Seagull. Rather than another disabled-only dance or theatre group, what we need is integration: after all, we live in the same world, not two separate ones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/when-beyonce-dropped-the-same-ableist-slur-as-lizzo-on-her-new-album-my-heart-sank\">When Beyoncé dropped the same ableist slur as Lizzo on her new album, my heart sank | Hannah Diviney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the past years it has felt as though a seismic shift has finally begun on matters of race, gender, sexuality and body size. But too often, it feels like disability is left behind. Time and time again, diversity is seen only through the lens of race or gender; body positivity is associated primarily with weight. Unlike with Black Lives Matter or women’s marches, mass protest for the disabled community poses numerous logistical difficulties, especially with Covid rates still so high and many vulnerable people shielding, so our suffering often feels invisible. With more and more people affected by chronic illness and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/27/long-covid-costing-uk-workers-up-to-15bn-yearly-in-lost-income-says-ifs\">taking extended sick leave</a> after Covid, it’s surprising the discourse has not caught up more. But if your progressive worldview does not include disability, it isn’t intersectional. Now that people have belatedly started to “do the work” on racism, they might want to add disability to their list, too.</p> <p>Ableism is pervasive, inextricably woven into our society and language: deformed, disfigured, crippled, handicapped, lame – these are objectively negative terms conjuring up something<strong> </strong>grotesque, to be avoided at all costs. Ableism in popular culture is just the tip of the iceberg: day to day, disabled people have to contend with the cost of living crisis, carer shortages, discrimination at work, inadequate medical care, disability benefits delays, feeling left behind by those who think the pandemic is over, and more. We need momentous change to start the fightback against thousands of years of prejudice. It’s not going to happen overnight. But if change doesn’t begin with the small things, the more important things will never follow.</p> <ul> <li><p>Kathryn Bromwich is a commissioning editor and writer on the Observer New Review</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/02/ollie-robinson-recalled-england-south-africa-cricket-tests","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T13:00:10Z","webTitle":"Jonny Bairstow will sit out Hundred in fresh blow to ECB’s showpiece event","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/ollie-robinson-recalled-england-south-africa-cricket-tests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/02/ollie-robinson-recalled-england-south-africa-cricket-tests","fields":{"headline":"Jonny Bairstow will sit out Hundred in fresh blow to ECB’s showpiece event","trailText":"The Hundred has been hit by the withdrawal of a second major English star after Jonny Bairstow decided to follow Ben Stokes’s example","byline":"Simon Burnton","body":"<p>The Hundred has been hit by the withdrawal of a second English star after Jonny Bairstow decided to follow the example of his Test captain, Ben Stokes, in choosing to rest rather than play in the England and Wales Cricket Board’s showpiece tournament.</p> \n<p>In a hectic international summer Bairstow has played in all four England Tests as well as nine of their 12 white-ball games, missing only the three Twenty20 matches against India.

It takes the pressure off, too: “I want to be enjoying time with my guests, not standing over the cooker.”</p> <p>While lamb and potatoes roasted with garlic, onions and bay is always a winner round Berg’s (especially when eaten with salsa verde), chicken thighs are the more economical choice. To this she would add aleppo chilli flakes, paprika, dried oregano, tomatoes, stock and that all important bay leaf (“it reminds me of being on holiday”), then serves it in the roasting tray sprinkled with parsley for freshness. You’ll most likely want a little something on the side, and Berg recommends a “lovely fresh salad” plus a couple of meze dishes, which can handily be prepped the day before. “You can’t go wrong with a thick, luscious <em>cacik</em> [yoghurt, cucumber, garlic, olive oil, dried mint, lemon, salt], hummus, and beetroot salad with lots of garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, fresh coriander and mint, red-wine vinegar and salt.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/29/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-toklas-london-serves-the-most-fabulous-chips\">Yohei Furuhashi</a>, meanwhile, suggests you replicate a veggie dish from the menu at <a href=\"https://www.toklaslondon.com/\">Toklas</a> in London, where he is head chef. Take some aubergine (ideally round ones) and slice horizontally into 2cm-thick pieces (“like burgers”). Dress with “olive oil, some seasoning, spices (dried chilli, dried oregano, coriander seeds) and garlic, and roast in a hot oven until brown on the outside but moist and soft inside”. Meanwhile, cut some big, juicy tomatoes into large pieces and roast with garlic and lots of olive oil. Then, build your dish: “A little tomato, aubergine, then add whatever vegetables you like, maybe green beans (we use yellow ones in the restaurant) or peas, and some basil”. Repeat this process then add a “texture element”, such as crushed almonds, raisins/sultanas, or pesto – “that combination is lovely”. As is so often the case, some bread on the side would be a very good thing.</p> <p>“Nothing says summer like whole grilled tilapia,” adds Akwasi Brenya-Mensa, chef-owner of the recently opened pan-African restaurant <a href=\"https://www.tataleandco.com/\">Tatale</a> in south London. “It’s a reasonably priced white fish; pick up a whole one from your local fishmonger, where they’ll descale and gut it for you.” Fish secured, Brenya-Mensa marinates it in green <em>shito</em> (a Ghanaian hot sauce of green peppers, scotch bonnet, ginger, garlic, onion and herbs) like his aunt Maud taught him: “Pat the fish dry with kitchen roll, then take a pastry brush, and salt and [brush] green shito all over the fish, including inside the cavities.” Stuff some lemon slices inside the fish, then “place on your barbecue and grill for 10 to fifteen minutes on each side, depending on its size”.</p> <p>Aunty also knows best when it comes to dessert. Berg recalls hers pouring melted white chocolate over frozen mixed berries – “I still love it.” For extra pizzazz, add a pistachio crumb; either way, you can’t get much simpler than that.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 4 August 2022, to correct the byline.

She said: “To suggest our fight against antisemitism on the left means that we are all part of a conspiracy to smear Corbyn is frankly absurd and of itself antisemitic. This consistent failure to understand and distinguish between our Jewish identity and the complex Middle East political issues is at the heart of why Jeremy continues to be outside the Labour party.”</p> \n<p>A Labour source said of Corbyn’s comments: “There cannot be any ambiguity about the choice he’s making, and that is to put himself outside the Labour mainstream.”</p> \n<p>Starmer has offered staunch support for the government’s stance on Ukraine, including the provision of weapons and military training to the country’s troops.</p> \n<p>He has stressed Labour’s longstanding backing for Nato, which is preparing to expand significantly in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Finland and Sweden poised to join.</p> \n<p>Starmer has also criticised the Stop the War Coalition, of which Corbyn is the co-vice chair with his close ally Andrew Murray, and hinted Corbyn’s readmission to the party would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/jeremy-corbyn-will-not-have-labour-whip-restored-starmer-suggests\">require him to distance himself </a>from the organisation.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/10/keir-starmer-says-stop-the-war-coalition-gives-help-to-authoritarians-like-putin\">Guardian article</a> earlier this year, Starmer said of Stop the War: “At best they are naive, at worst they actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies.

The US president, Joe Biden, announced the death on Monday evening in an address to the nation.</p> <h2>Who was Zawahiri?</h2> <p>The 71-year-old Egyptian-born veteran had been an underground militant since he was a teenager in Cairo. He first travelled to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Zawahiri orchestrated suicide bombings over several decades and had become one of the world’s most wanted men. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/05/osama-bin-laden-not-armed\">Osama bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals</a> during a 2011 raid in Pakistan, Zawahiri became the head of al-Qaida and the public face of the global militant group.</p> <h2>How did the US find him?</h2> <p>Until al-Qaida <a href=\"https://www.wionews.com/world/in-new-video-al-qaeda-leader-zawahiri-praises-indian-student-over-hijab-row-468815\">released a video</a> of Zawahiri in April, many had speculated the ageing leader was already dead.

Biden made the decision to assassinate Zawahiri last week.</p> <h2>When was the strike carried out?</h2> <p>The strike happened at 9.48pm Eastern Time on Saturday (Sunday morning in Kabul) by an unmanned aerial vehicle – a drone – while Zawahiri was on the terrace.</p> <h2>What is the relationship between al-Qaida and the Taliban?</h2> <p>Al-Qaida and the Taliban have a deeply entangled relationship that stretches back decades – sometimes cooperating and sometimes clashing.</p> <p>The 2001 US invasion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> demolished al-Qaida’s safe haven, and Zawahiri rebuilt the group in the Afghan-Pakistan border region.

Nuclear energy would need a carbon price in order to be viable, so that technology was a pathway to lead a conservative like Howard to accept emissions trading – a position the Liberals then held until Tony Abbott thought it was politically convenient to weaponise emissions trading as a “carbon tax” and use that to blast the Coalition back into government.</p> <p>Now nuclear is being invoked to leash the Nationals and give the After Dark roster on Sky News something to have #BigFeelings™ about while Liberals work out how on earth to regroup on climate policy over the next three years.</p> <p>Dutton said on Tuesday his new nuclear review would be led by Ted O’Brien.</p> <p><em>Who</em>, you ask? O’Brien is the new shadow minister for climate change and energy.</p> <p>Dutton then declared it was “high time that Australia had an honest and informed debate on the benefits and costs of nuclear energy”.</p> <p><em>High time</em> is possibly a little insulting to O’Brien.</p> <p>Back in 2019, when O’Brien was chair of federal parliament’s standing committee on environment and energy, he authored a <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Environment_and_Energy/Nuclearenergy/Report\">report</a> intended – as O’Brien put it at the time – to provide “a way forward for nuclear technology in Australia”.</p> <p>Sadly, O’Brien’s path forward proved to be very short.</p> <p>Emerging nuclear technologies only rated a cursory mention in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/21/new-nuclear-technologies-to-be-examined-in-planning-australias-energy-mix\">the Morrison government’s subsequent technology roadmap</a>. These technologies had “potential but require R&amp;D and identified deployment pathways”.

It didn’t. Now, in opposition, we’ll have O’Brien (2022) agreeing with O’Brien (ignored in 2019), or possibly we’ll have duelling O’Briens. Who says politics is too cruel a profession for closure?</p> <p>I mean no disrespect to O’Brien, who has a couple of masters degrees and proficiency in Chinese.

That was two weeks ago.</p> <p>Back in 2006, the Switkowski review commissioned by Howard found that nuclear power was likely to be between 20% and 50% more costly to produce than power from a new coal-fired plant at current fossil fuel prices in Australia.</p> <p>It said nuclear would only become competitive in Australia in a system where the costs of greenhouse gas emissions were explicitly recognised, and even then, reactors would require government subsidies.</p> <p>Ziggy Switkowski appeared before O’Brien’s inquiry in 2019 and said there was no coherent business case to finance an Australian nuclear industry before adding: “I have emphasised that one of the things that has changed over the last decade or so is that nuclear power has got more expensive rather than less expensive”.</p> <p>The South Australian government, through a royal commission, also examined the viability of nuclear in 2016 and found it wasn’t a goer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/labors-climate-bill-is-mostly-symbolic-the-big-questions-are-about-what-comes-next\">Labor’s climate bill is mostly symbolic - the big questions are about what comes next | Adam Morton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I’m technology agnostic.

That’s not the case now – not only because games have gotten longer and more involving, as I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jul/26/pushing-buttons-my-search-for-finite-jest-neverending-games\">wrote about last week</a>, but also because so many of them are released. The publisher model, where a few big companies controlled the release calendar, has given way to a mix of legacy megaliths (Sony, EA, Nintendo, Microsoft), indie publishers (Devolver, Annapurna, Team17), self-releasing developers and everything in between. How is a player supposed to keep up?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Pushing Buttons, our weekly guide to what’s going on in video games.\">  <iframe id=\"pushing-buttons\" name=\"pushing-buttons\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/pushing-buttons\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--pushing-buttons\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for Pushing Buttons, our weekly guide to what’s going on in video games.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Good curation is one of the most useful things a games critic can offer in 2022. But even though it’s my job to know what’s going on in video games, stuff flies under my radar all the time. There used to be a few days of game announcements a year at big conferences such as E3 and the Tokyo Game Show (and Nintendo Space World, for fans of a certain vintage). Now there is a year-round stream of announcements, updates and teases. Sometimes I’ll have kept an eye on an interesting game for a year, only to discover that it was surprise-released two weeks ago. It drives me nuts.</p> <p>To help make sense of the relentless morass of information, I asked Guardian contributors to pick out a game or two that stood out to them from the onslaught of summer announcements. Then I asked them to interview the creators. The resulting stories will be published throughout August. First up: Edwin Evans-Thirlwell on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/01/im-doing-puzzles-that-may-take-10-years-to-solve-animal-well-a-mysterious-video-game-time-capsule\">Animal Well</a>, a fascinating pixel-art puzzle/adventure game that he describes as “a deliberate time capsule, a refuge for its creator’s daydreams and nightmares”. It’s vaguely creepy, a technical marvel – I’ve never seen pixel animation quite like it – and hard to pin down genre-wise (a bit like Fez, say, or Hollow Knight).</p> <p>Later this week, Malindy Hetfeld will shine some light on Venba, the cooking game about a Canadian immigrant family that I wrote about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jun/21/pushing-buttons-five-new-games-that-look-like-nothing-youve-seen-before\">few weeks ago</a>; and Nic Reuben takes a look at Scorn, a Cronenbergian horror game from Serbia. Next week, Lewis Gordon profiles Skate Story, a skateboarding game where you are “a demon made out of glass and pain”. Visit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/series/summer-games-previews\">this page</a> if you want to see all our summer games previews as they go up – you can find them in the links section of the newsletter all month, too.</p> <p>Exhausting though a flood of fresh releases and info can be, it is one of the reasons why I love covering games: you don’t always know what’s coming. There are predictably exciting titles around which hype always gathers, of course – who wouldn’t be keen to see what Rockstar has been doing with Grand Theft Auto 6? – but then games like Untitled Goose Game or Neon White can come along and take me by surprise. Summer is usually quiet for games news, but this year there have been at least 10 noteworthy titles released so far (Stray, Live a Live, Neon White, Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course, As Dusk Falls, The Quarry and Xenoblade Chronicles 3, to name some off the top of my head). And we’re only just into August. The unpredictability can throw you – but it’s also exciting.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cac5cee8fbe97187b42a0ec8515d4eb02bb949c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cac5cee8fbe97187b42a0ec8515d4eb02bb949c6/204_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South of the Circle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South of the Circle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: State of Play/Steam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811040/South_of_the_Circle/\">South of the Circle</a></strong> has been out on Apple Arcade since 2020, but it’s released this week on all other platforms.

We took every possible precaution to avoid civilian harm.”</p> \n<p>The official said they were able to watch members of the Taliban try after the strike to conceal Zawahiri’s former presence at the location, swiftly removing his wife, daughter and her children to another location.</p> \n<p>“We have identified a concerted effort to restrict access to the safe house in the surrounding area for hours after the strike. The safe house used by al-Zawahiri is now empty.”</p> \n<p>Unverified pictures on social media of what was described as the target of the attack showed shattered windows of a pink building, its fences topped with rolls of barbed wire.

We will never forget. We continue to mourn every innocent life that was stolen on 9/11 and honour their memories.”</p> \n<h2>Concerns about al-Qaida in Afghanistan</h2> \n<p>Zawahiri’s death marks the biggest blow to the fundamentalist Islamist organisation since the death of Bin Laden.</p> \n<p>In a statement, a Taliban spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, confirmed that a strike took place and strongly condemned it, calling it a violation of “international principles”.</p> \n<p>Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon, helped coordinate the 9/11 attacks in which four civilian aircraft were hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center’s twin towers in New York, the Pentagon near Washington and a Pennsylvania field, killing nearly 3,000 people.

Under Ole Gunnar Solskjær winning a 21st crown was the ambition. Now, after the poorest of campaigns which ended with the team in sixth, 35 points behind Manchester City and a third manager in less than a year in place in Erik ten Hag, should the Dutchman’s team place fourth this would be a minor miracle.</p> \n<p>Why it might happen: the 52-year-old has signed Tyrell Malacia, a 22-year-old dynamic left-back, Christian Eriksen on a free (the silky playmaker is possibly the best value of the window) as well as Lisandro Martínez, a feisty defender, from Ajax. If – a big one – Frenkie de Jong follows from Barcelona Ten Hag will have a complete quartet of his targets: fair reason for optimism.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a9178a3-09da-4eb7-b01a-ce6c411dc3dd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hh_CtvYZUug?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Why it might not: Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal (who all finished above United) have strengthened their ranks. Also, Ten Hag has three Eredivisie titles and a Champions League semi-final with Ajax on the CV but is unknown in the Premier League.</p> \n<p>He is also hampered by the season’s early start due to the winter World Cup, meaning less time – five weeks – to implement his fast-pressing, constant pass-and-move style. To hear Ten Hag instruct a group during training at Bangkok’s Rajamangala Stadium earlier this month that football “is triangles, always the same principles” was a touch alarming: elite footballers should already be versed in this fundamental.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/manchester-united/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>All of Ten Hag’s predecessors since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club possessed flaws that cost them their job. David Moyes was callow, Louis van Gaal stubborn, José Mourinho volatile and Solskjaer tactically limited. The hope is the 52-year-old Dutchman has diametric qualities and will be a quick learner when it comes to English football. His ruthlessness with players and relentless demand for excellence was evident during the pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia and augurs well. An unknown factor is how Ten Hag can improve a squad which – Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes and David de Gea apart – had a collective nightmare last season: this may be the X-factor that elevates his tenure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09321cb3b7c3e3ae298b1e5343c627a0bdbdc627\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09321cb3b7c3e3ae298b1e5343c627a0bdbdc627/0_0_5015_3493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag (centre) leads his team’s training session for the pre-season tour match against Liverpool in Bangkok.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag (centre) leads his team’s training session for the pre-season tour match against Liverpool in Bangkok.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Considering the scale of the rebuild facing Ten Hag to be able to recruit a player of Christian Eriksen’s calibre for no fee could be the actual definition of “transfer coup”. This is a playmaker with a claim to be on the same plane of gamechanging ability as Bruno Fernandes, who is United’s most consistent performer (alongside Ronaldo). So the new manager has certainly enhanced the squad’s quality and the hope will be that Eriksen can ease the load on Fernandes while offering a differing dimension.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>Nearly all the squad will be in Doha. Close to the whole defence – De Gea, Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Varane, Martínez, Luke Shaw, Malacia, Alex Telles (if he is not sold) – though Victor Lindelöf’s Sweden and Eric Bailly’s Ivory Coast failed to qualify. In midfield only Scott McTominay’s Scotland missed out. And from the attack, Fernandes, Donny van de Beek, Ronaldo, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho could all be called up but Anthony Elanga is Swedish so will have a breather.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:41:59/embed.html\" data-alt=\"d\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:41:59/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>Maybe take in some of the hipper-than-hip bars in the city.

Or find your bucolic self, walking the miles of Manchester canal and the area’s copious rivers – Mersey, Tame, Irwell, Irk, Medlock, Boggart Hole Brook, Chorlton Brook, Tib, Moston Brook.</p> \n<h2>Leading the shirt sales</h2> \n<p>Ronaldo, of course, though his thus-far summer-long will-he-stay, will-he-go status has surely dented maximum return on units sold as disgruntled fans are turned off by it. The Glazers want him to remain – Ronaldo is a global<em> </em>commercial phenomenon: why would they not? – and though Ten Hag is adamant he is not for sale (and may even stay beyond next season) the manager cannot be blamed if secretly praying for an exit. Ronaldo’s 37-year-old legs can no longer execute a performance of 90 minutes running. Beyond Ronaldo, Eriksen can be expected to accumulate serious sales numbers.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>Could Lisandro Martínez’s tough-tacking, I’ll-die-for-the-shirt persona make him a shoo-in to become an Instagram, TikTok, and other social media happening?

Now it faces a further, deeply ironic, obstacle – a lawmaker who was once a member of the Green party.</p> <p>Last week, Joe Manchin, the centrist West Virginia senator who has been lavished by donations from the fossil fuel industry and made millions of dollars from his ownership of a coal-trading firm, stunned Washington by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/manchin-deal-democrats-schumer-reconciliation-bill-climate-health\">announcing his support</a> for $369bn in spending to boost renewable energy and slash planet-heating emissions.</p> <p>Manchin’s backing of the bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, is critical given Democrats’ slender control of an evenly divided senate. But the fate of Joe Biden’s agenda, along with broader hopes of maintaining a livable climate, now appears to have shifted to another swing vote in the US Senate: Kyrsten Sinema.</p> <p>It’s unclear whether Sinema, an enigmatic and elusive figure, will support the bill, which requires all 50 Democratic votes to pass in the face of unified Republican opposition to acting on the climate crisis. Sinema’s office has said the Arizona lawmaker will “need to review the text and what comes out of the parliamentarian process” before deciding whether to back it.</p> <p>The uncertainty adds to a tortuous process that has stretched back for more than 18 months, with both Manchin and Sinema stymying Biden’s original plan for a $3.5tn bill that included sweeping measures to force down emissions.</p> <p>A pared-down bill, which includes vast tax credits for clean energy and incentives to purchase electric cars has now, eventually, been agreed with Manchin, who on Sunday called Sinema a “friend” and that he “would like to think she’d be favorable to it”.</p> <p>But there is no guarantee of Sinema’s support, given her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/22/kyrsten-sinema-climate-advocates-exasperated-biden-bill\">mercurial career</a>, which began as a Green party member who was anti-war and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-road-to-the-senate-runs-straight-through-trump-country-1520266957\">criticized capitalism</a>, before becoming one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress. Since being elected to the US Senate in 2018, the first Democrat to do so from Arizona since 1976, Sinema has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/10/kyrsten-sinema-arizona-senate-senator-infrastructure-spending-biden-democrats\">become best known</a> for her colorful wigs, unconventional outfits and calls for bipartisan agreement with Republicans.</p> <p>Her previous action to block Biden’s initial attempt at climate legislation has alarmed advocates and some scientists who warn the US is running out of time to act on global heating. “It seems distinctly possible that she will sink the bill, or make enough concessions to Republican opponents to climate action that the bill is rendered toothless,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University.</p> <p>“She seems much more interested in working toward the interests of her corporate donors than the people she is supposed to represent. I hope that my suspicions are proven wrong.”</p> <p>Mann said that if Sinema does sink the bill, legislation that analysts said would slash US emissions <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/inflation-reduction-act/\">by about 40% this decade</a>, he would endorse a primary opponent to Sinema. </p> <p>Although she rarely gives interviews or engages with many of her constituents, Sinema has previously expressed reticence to raise taxes on corporations and may look unfavorably at measures in the new bill, called “closing loopholes” by Manchin, that would require large companies to pay a certain level of tax.</p> <p>However, backers of the bill say they are hopeful that Arizona’s vulnerability to rising temperatures will help convince Sinema of the need for significant action to reduce emissions. Arizona is one of the <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/cxgxgstp8r5d/2NWdFjGbnTa1rKLqwf9Gn6/4912a79f7789bf763fc096e2419c27a5/HeatIsOn-PressRelease.pdf\">fastest-heating states in the US</a>, with Phoenix enduring <a href=\"https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/heat-deaths-in-maricopa-county-hit-half-year-record/75-fae089d0-656c-4920-bfe9-f225f9915464\">a record year so far</a> for heat-related deaths. In May, Sinema toured the aftermath of a huge wildfire near Flagstaff that she called “sobering”.</p> <p>“By supporting this bill Senator Sinema can help grow Arizona’s energy economy while protecting her constituents from the extreme heat, droughts and wildfires that runaway climate change would inflict on them,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former US Senate staff member, who is now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. “Those strong incentives make her support seem overwhelmingly likely.”</p> <p>Mann said people in Arizona are “suffering the devastating consequences of climate change already, in the form of extreme heat, deadly floods and wildfires. If she votes down this bill, it is a slap in the face of her constituents.”</p> <p>Republicans have not given up hope of obstructing the bill’s progress, with Pat Toomey, a GOP senator from Pennsylvania, expressing optimism that Sinema could be convinced to vote against it.</p> <p>“I’m not speculating about what she is going to do, but I do know there are some provisions in this field that she has had reservations in the past,” Toomey told Bloomberg on Monday. “I’m looking forward to chatting with her this week.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/02/all-work-and-no-play-why-the-cartoon-world-needs-to-stop-copying-the-corporate","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"All work and no play: why the cartoon world needs to stop copying the corporate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/02/all-work-and-no-play-why-the-cartoon-world-needs-to-stop-copying-the-corporate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/02/all-work-and-no-play-why-the-cartoon-world-needs-to-stop-copying-the-corporate","fields":{"headline":"All work and no play: why the cartoon world needs to stop copying the corporate","trailText":"According to animated movies, all human life is controlled by monsters or rabbits or leprechauns diligently working a 9 to 5 in a metaphysical office complex – where’s the fun in that?","byline":"Nicholas Barber","body":"<p>Do you feel lucky?

When they press one button, you find a £10 note. When they press another, you fall down a manhole.</p> <p>That, at least, is the premise of Luck, an Apple+ cartoon premiering in August. The film reveals that human affairs are influenced from the Land of Luck – although, judging by the trailer, “The Office Complex of Luck” would be more accurate. Hundreds of leprechauns and rabbits (and a black cat voiced by Simon Pegg) bustle along the corridors of a shiny business campus, delivering parcels, reading memos, and reporting to their smartly suited boss, a dragon voiced by Jane Fonda.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSG5UX0EQVg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xSG5UX0EQVg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The idea that something as intangible as luck might be governed by otherworldly workers is a fun one – and, 20 years ago, it might have seemed like an original one, too. But in 2022, the contrast between the ethereal and the boringly bureaucratic is as much of a cartoon cliche as zany talking animals. Take a mysterious, metaphysical concept, add a crowd of bean-counters and pen-pushers, and you’ve got yourself a film.</p> <p>To be fair, this sort of comedy has an illustrious history, ranging from Powell and Pressburger’s A Matter of Life and Death (in which Peter learns that heaven has filing clerks) to Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice (in which the newly deceased Maitlands visit an afterlife information desk). In animation, the gamechanger was Monsters, Inc. in 2001 – and it’s still one of Pixar’s most delightful cartoons. You can’t beat the sight of furry and/or slimy creatures cheerfully clocking in at a factory where they bottle children’s screams in yellow canisters. Ten years later, a similar combination of the industrial and the magical did the trick in Aardman’s Arthur Christmas. There was a pleasing logic to the suggestion that Santa’s elves would need desk-top computers and digital displays, and yet the film retained a sprinkling of traditional festive wonder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"345fd052d569a49338ad51e6acef6b9e479d2905\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/345fd052d569a49338ad51e6acef6b9e479d2905/41_0_1865_1119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corporate scaremongers … Monsters, Inc.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corporate scaremongers … Monsters, Inc.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the decade since, though, the same big-business bric-a-brac has been used in cartoon after cartoon: the conveyor belts and gangways; the announcements on tannoys, and the consoles studded with levers and dials; the monitors showing individual houses, and the wall-sized screens showing a map of the Earth. There’s often a cityscape stretching beyond the centre of operations, and there’s often an unwitting human who bumbles in and messes up an otherwise foolproof system. And there are filing cabinets. So many filing cabinets.</p> <p>These incorporeal-corporate set-ups have become every American cartoon’s answer to life’s trickiest questions. Where do babies come from? According to Storks, the storks involved have collars and ties and productivity graphs. On the other hand, The Boss Baby contends that the babies run the show from their cubicles, where they study pie charts and dream of corner offices.</p> <p>But where do children’s personalities come from? Soul gives the standard corporate headquarters a new-age makeover, but it still has seminars, name tags, a grumpy accountant, and yes, filing cabinets. In Inside Out, moods and memories are overseen by a team of colleagues with a dashboard, a clipboard, and a complicated data storage process. And in Coco – much like A Matter of Life and Death and Beetlejuice – the Land of the Dead has managers, regulations, and filing cabinets, too. Crucially, all of this mystical mucking about is suspiciously godlike, but specific deities and religions are never mentioned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d26c8a38f49fc2561126ab47ede0690525829b96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26c8a38f49fc2561126ab47ede0690525829b96/0_0_4096_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emotional industrial complex … Inside Out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emotional industrial complex … Inside Out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AA Film Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there are the less highfalutin examples. Ever wanted to know what goes on inside a beehive, an arcade game or the internet? Bee Movie, Wreck-It Ralph and The Emoji Movie agree that they’re full of wage slaves doing their nine-to-five jobs.</p> <p>If any one person is behind this trend, it’s Pete Docter, who directed Monsters, Inc., Inside Out, and Soul, and who helped define what a Pixar cartoon could be. (It can’t be a coincidence that Luck is the first film from Skydance Animation – and that the studio’s head of animation is Pixar’s former supremo, John Lasseter.) Docter’s own cartoons come across as sincere attempts to be truthful about abstruse philosophical conundrums. But in most of the films directed by his imitators, all the talk of quotas and promotions and performance reviews seems like a lazy gimmick, and a pretty depressing one at that. As charming as these cartoons can be, their underlying message is that the best way to facilitate anything – birth, death, joy, Christmas presents – is to have hordes of diligent employees devoting themselves to one monolithic company.</p> <p>You can see why that message might appeal to executives at Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks and Skydance, but I hope the trend is coming to an end. I’m not feeling lucky, though. Pixar’s 2023 release, Elemental, is set “in a city where fire, water, land, and air residents live together”. Don’t be surprised if there are filing cabinets in there somewhere.</p> <p>• Luck is released on 5 August in cinemas and Apple TV+.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/02/hot-seat-review-mel-gibson-call-centre-guy-schlocky-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"Hot Seat review – call centre guy is pinned down in office chair in schlocky thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/02/hot-seat-review-mel-gibson-call-centre-guy-schlocky-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/02/hot-seat-review-mel-gibson-call-centre-guy-schlocky-thriller","fields":{"headline":"Hot Seat review – call centre guy is pinned down in office chair in schlocky thriller","trailText":"Office equipment turns deadly after a bomb-maker targets a reformed hacker at work.

One sunny day in southern California, Orlando makes excuses as to why he can’t stay at home and attend the birthday party of his teenage daughter Zoey (Anna Harr), citing work demands. His wife Kim (Lydia Hull) is so fed up with his perpetual absence, she hands him divorce papers. But off to work he goes nevertheless, where he is soon punished for his lack of paternal commitment when he discovers that an unseen bomb-maker, at first just a voice on the phone, has set a trap for him at work. Unless Orlando helps the bomber with some hacking tasks, a bomb planted under Orlando’s chair will explode if he gets up or even wheels beyond a new rug by his desk.</p> <p>The office equipment theme extends in budget-friendly ways throughout the film which is mostly set in just one location, and eventually encompasses deadly traps in an elevator and a server room a few floors down. I was expecting the stationary cupboard or breakroom microwave to yield a deadly surprise, but alas no. Still, the script and direction by prolific low-budget film-maker James Cullen Bressack do spring a few mild surprises and minor twists to spice things up. That doesn’t quite make up for the tackiness elsewhere – such as the cheesy animation near the climax that illustrates bits and bytes going down internet wires to trigger explosive outcomes – or the simpering, thinly written roles for poor Zoey and Kim who spend much of the film cowering and looking worried.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y59imeaYCo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9Y59imeaYCo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Fans of 1990s film and TV will enjoy the presence of Shannen Doherty as the police chief and, to a lesser extent, Mel Gibson as a grizzled bomb squad cop whose partner Jackson (Eddie Steeples) is all too prone to making predictions about what happens next based on knowledge of cop-movie conventions.

I had previously sailed with two of the crew who are now on the Rainbow Warrior, and there they still were, fighting for climate justice around the world.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, as Britain beat not only its own all-time temperature record, but Cuba’s, Singapore’s and Panama’s, there were still people shouting that it was all perfectly normal and just an ordinary sunny day. What sort of fantasy world do these people live in, and who built it for them? My trip to Venice helped me answer this question.</p> <p>I didn’t know it when I arrived, but Greenpeace activists were about to <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/53946/greenpeace-boat-protest-fossil-fuel-advertising-will-put-venice-under-water/\" title=\"\">stage a protest </a>that involved moving through the canals of the lagoon city on traditional boats, while carrying the logos of major European oil and gas firms that use greenwashing – marketing techniques that try to convince us they are environmentally friendly when the opposite is true : they want to keep us hooked on fossil fuels. This is killing the planet. The activists ironically announced it as the Last Tour of Venice, as the city is at risk of submersion due to climate impacts in the Mediterranean region, like the ones we’ve been recently witnessing with record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires raging across the region.</p> <p>Last October, Greenpeace and another 30 organisations launched a European citizens’ initiative calling for <a href=\"http://greenpeace.org/fossilfreerevolution\" title=\"\">a new law</a> banning fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in the EU, similar to what happened with tobacco at the beginning of this century.

Fossil fuel companies are pumping millions into greenwashing while making meaningless net zero promises and introducing false “solutions”, in order to gloss over their decades of destruction.

Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-born industrialist who became one of the US’s richest philanthropists, is berated by his own dinosaur “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2018/sep/24/deeply-dippy-how-britons-flock-to-see-the-dinosaur-on-tour\">Dippy</a>”, the famous diplodocus whose skeleton he put on display in Pittsburgh while sending casts to museums around the world, including Britain’s Natural History Museum, as an ambassador of world peace.</p> <p>Ewan’s film has Dippy chastise a kilt-clad Carnegie for concealing his ruthless capitalism behind a generosity that included founding 2,509 libraries worldwide.

This exhibition celebrates wealthy Scottish art collectors, notably Alexander and Rosalind Maitland, who bought masterpieces of modern French art and bequeathed them to the public. This may not sound like a recipe for excitement, even with its much-reported revelation of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jul/14/hidden-van-gogh-self-portrait-discovered-behind-earlier-painting\">hidden Van Gogh</a> self-portrait on the back of a study for The Potato Eaters. But it’s an irresistible box of bonbons for the eyes with a few shots of absinthe thrown in.</p> <p>Monet’s Haystacks: Snow Effect is a dazzling dream painting from 1891 in which silver and blue light reflected off snow turns two loaf-like haystacks into ethereal abstractions against a pink sky. Gauguin’s Martinique Landscape equals it in the abstract intensity of its reds and greens, cooking up a tropical heat that dissolves reality. This cavalcade of perceptual revolutions also stars Courbet, Millet, Pissarro and Cézanne, and a Degas bronze of a woman baring all in the bath whose explicitness has no peers today except Tracey Emin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/30/tracey-emin-review-fiercely-honest-artist-bares-body-and-soul\">whose nudes are at Edinburgh’s Jupiter Artland for comparison</a>. It climaxes with Matisse’s Jazz. You see with new clarity how Matisse, in these 1940s prints that identify with African American music, expressed his hatred of nazism and belief in liberty: his ever-transforming cut-up colours shape and reshape impressions as spontaneously as a bebop solo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b41e4083ceef98b5494e65c12dd1f7190768a16a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b41e4083ceef98b5494e65c12dd1f7190768a16a/0_0_1920_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irresistible … Olive Trees, 1889, by Vincent Van Gogh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"770\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irresistible … Olive Trees, 1889, by Vincent Van Gogh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Galleries of Scotland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How do you follow that? <a href=\"http://www.ifecosse.org.uk/\">Platform at the French Institute</a> is billed as a stage for “emerging” Scottish artists but this leaves you wondering how they are to be judged – as students or fully fledged practitioners? There’s a sense here of artists being too cosily indulged, getting away with stuff that is slight. Perhaps Scotland needs nastier art critics. I like Lynsey MacKenzie’s room of pink, orange and yellow abstract paintings, windswept and cleansing – yet she needs another dimension, some harder thinking to make them great.</p> <p>Then again perhaps this loss of purpose and energy in art is a worldwide phenomenon. At <a href=\"https://www.trg.ed.ac.uk/\">the Talbot Rice</a>, the kind of weirdly arbitrary space that makes you wonder why anyone thought it would make a good art gallery, a survey of London-based Céline Condorelli raises a worry if anyone is imposing quality control anywhere now. Condorelli’s installations include plants and celebrate playgrounds as well as Brazil’s modernist architecture. I seem to have seen that a hundred times before. Vague semi-comprehensible utopian rhetoric is mixed with collections of found objects and cocktails of colour that don’t have any emotional resonance. This is art that exists only for someone to write a thesis about it.</p> <p>You can see art that lives and breathes at <a href=\"https://stills.org/\">Stills</a>, a photography centre surrounded by tourist cafes on a street curling down from the Royal Mile, where Japan’s Ishiuchi Miyako has a small but shattering retrospective of her shockingly intimate photographs. Going through the gallery’s shopfront entrance you find yourself surrounded by frayed and torn yet exquisitely colourful clothes: a blue and white suit that’s been savagely ripped up, lacy dresses that look charred as well as gnawed by giant moths. What makes these photographs so uncanny is Ishiuchi’s perfect lighting and colour, which you feel she must have spent months getting just so. And then you realise what they are.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2dada557257376da19f5587bf9d669fff68a821d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dada557257376da19f5587bf9d669fff68a821d/0_0_3965_5787/685.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh perspective on tragedy … Ishiuchi Miyako’s ひろしま hiroshima #106 donor Hashimoto, H.\" width=\"685\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh perspective on tragedy … Ishiuchi Miyako’s ひろしま hiroshima #106 donor Hashimoto, H.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ishiuchi Miyako/Courtesy of The Third Gallery/Stills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These are the clothes of victims of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/18/story-of-cities-hiroshima-japan-nuclear-destruction\">the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima</a> in 1945. It takes a serious artist to expose a genuinely fresh perspective on such a tragedy, but these eerily beautiful pictures make you see the horror as if for the first time – the clothes blasted apart in wardrobes or torn and burnt off bodies, their frail delicate, fashions still bearing witness to all the variety of lives that were stilled in a moment. Ishiuchi brings the same unsettling intimacy to pictures of her late mother’s possessions and Frida Kahlo’s medical corset, seemingly able to get her camera inside the objects, to touch ghosts.</p> <p>Down the hill at the <a href=\"https://www.fruitmarket.co.uk/\">Fruitmarket Gallery</a> there’s further proof that art can escape the corset of ideological curating to express something about being alive. Daniel Silver has created a bonkers world of ceramic people, thrown together with wild, hilarious sloppiness then painted in head-spinning colours. Small figures are spread out on tables with huge clay human legs and an “audience” of grimacing faces stare back at you, while random giant legs occupy a third space of their own. Silver’s people should be absurd, like Carnegie and his dinosaur. But the difference is empathy. His clay faces and bodies may be ridiculous – but have you looked in the mirror lately? We are they. Each of these vulnerable, isolated beings is an expressionist portrayal of human existence. Silver echoes Auerbach and Baselitz, and they are among the best artists to echo.</p> <p>There’s real depth at this art festival, and even the sillier stuff is, after all, an excuse to explore one of Europe’s most remarkable cities. Don’t miss <a href=\"https://dovecotstudios.com/exhibitions/alan-davie-beginning-of-a-far-off-world\">Dovecot Studios</a>, near the South Bridge, where you can watch weavers at work as well as seeing a retrospective of the late Scottish modernist Alan Davie. At the time of his death in 2014 the nonagenarian Davie couldn’t have seemed less relevant. Yet this exhibition confirms him as an artist of biting power, Scotland’s Jackson Pollock, who kept the flame of abstract art ablaze in a Britain that had little time for it. Art either has guts and vision or it doesn’t, and the rough spattery paintings of Davie have it in peat-cutting spades.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.edinburghartfestival.com/\">The Edinburgh Art festival takes place at various venues until 28 August</a>.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/02/oil-industry-record-profits-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T10:25:12Z","webTitle":"The world is ablaze and the oil industry just posted record profits.

We must break it or it will break us","byline":"Hamilton Nolan","body":"<p>It is useful to think of capitalism as a robotic savant, spectacularly gifted at doing one thing and cripplingly blind to everything else. Global capitalism is an incredible machine for extracting fossil fuels from our planet, refining them, shipping them to every corner of the Earth and making staggering amounts of money doing so. The humming of this machine, the fuel and the money that it spits out, has powered a century of unprecedented production and consumption by the Earth’s first-world nations. Unfortunately the machine is also poisoning us all. But one of its exquisitely evolved functions is to make it almost impossible to turn it off.</p> <p>Oil and gas profits in the most recent quarter were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/business/exxon-chevron-profit.html\">astounding</a>. Exxon Mobil made $18bn in profits in the past three months. Shell and Chevron each made nearly $12bn. Those are all record numbers. More major companies will announce their figures this week, and they are all expected to be bountiful. The war in Ukraine, which has devastated a region of the world and displaced millions, has helped energy companies by driving oil and gas prices higher. In this, we see another key characteristic of the machine: the fortunes of nations may rise and fall, but the oil companies will always survive and thrive, floating above the chaos of the world like passengers on a private jet, shaking their heads performatively at all the problems below.</p> <p>The price of oil fluctuates, but that short-term volatility masks the industry’s long-term certainty of success. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/revealed-oil-sectors-staggering-profits-last-50-years\">study</a> showed that for the past 50 years, the oil industry has made profits of more than $1tn a year, close to $3bn a day. These profits are driven not by some fantasy of free enterprise and perfect competition, but by the exact opposite – cartels, mega-corporations and the regulatory capture of governments, conspiring to create a market free of both competition and of a price that reflects the actual cost to the world of the product that is being sold.</p> <p>Fossil fuels make enough money to corrupt politicians, cause wars and bend public opinion through the brute force of a firehose of propaganda. The machine does not just extract and sell fossil fuels; it also concerns itself with ensuring that the entire world is arranged in a way conducive to maintaining the demand for those fossil fuels. The growth of oil profits even as the reality of climate change is burning before our eyes is proof that no single crisis, no matter how existential, will be enough to shut this machine down naturally. The machine must either be broken by us, or it will break us all.</p> <p>Capitalism is not designed to look several generations down the road. It is not designed to sacrifice for the greater good. It is designed to maximize profits. To pump every last barrel of oil on Earth, sell it, take the money and build a luxurious space ship to leave the planet that has been destroyed by burning all of that gas is a perfectly rational course of action according to the logic of capitalism. As long as there is a trillion dollars a year to be made, the fossil fuel industry will take the money. It is enough money to build a nice villa far, far away from the wars and droughts and floods and wildfires that fossil fuels are causing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Capitalism is not designed to look several generations down the road</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These profits are illusory. They are plagued by an externality large enough to outweigh a trillion dollars a year – the costs that the climate crisis will impose on billions of people who are alive now and many generations to come. The fact that capitalism is unable to properly price a barrel of oil to account for all the pain it will cause to your grandchildren whose home is wiped out by rising seas is proof that the whole idea of an impartial system of costs and rewards for labor and risks is a big sham.</p> <p>The fossil fuel industry as a whole is not just another business, providing a service to meet a demand; it is a predatory drug dealer that works every day to keep the world addicted to its poisonous product, knowing full well that it will eventually prove fatal. It fights to keep the population fooled about its costs, to keep the political power structure incapable of keeping the public safe from its damages, and to keep the flow of supply coming at full blast despite any human or environmental toll. It is not something to be applauded. It is a problem to be solved.</p> <p>It’s no big mystery how to change this toxic dynamic. Merely putting a price on fossil fuel that accurately reflects its costs – for example, through a carbon tax – would do the trick, with time, as it rapidly became economically unfeasible to mortgage the health of the planet’s future on a carbon credit card. Better, and faster, would be straightforward regulations paired with enormous public investments to transition to cleaner energy sources, a la the Green New Deal. The barrier here is not ideas, but rather politics, backstopped with a wall of money. So long as America fails to regulate the influence of money in politics, we will by extension fail to adequately regulate fossil fuels.</p> <p>It is folly to assume that a system that has been constructed in part by the corporate power of the energy industry will find a way to rein in that same industry against its wishes. It’s willfully stupid to imagine that electoral politics will be up to this task. This is an issue that is, more than most, begging for radicalism. It will take more than installing a solar panel on your roof. For older people with means, it will take agitating within each and every institution you are a part of to divest from the fossil fuel industry; for younger people with passion, it will take agitating in the streets. For all of us, it will take treating the tremendous but slow-moving threat of climate change with the deadly seriousness it deserves.</p> <p>So next time you see young people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/25/chuck-schumer-sit-in-staffers-arrested\">sitting in</a> at a senator’s office or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/23/extinction-rebellion-blocks-busy-junction-in-london\">blocking</a> the streets or <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/29/joe-manchin-houseboat-activists-517482\">hollering</a> at Joe Manchin’s yacht, don’t mock them.

While </strong><strong>we were waiting for the results we were kissing</strong><strong> in</strong><strong> bed. </strong><strong>He said, “</strong><strong>I wish I could be inside you,” and I said, “</strong><strong>I’m literally naked and begging for it.” This was the incident that he found pressurising.</strong></p> <p><strong>Later, I found out that he identifies as </strong><strong>demisexual</strong><strong>.

Some people – especially those who are in the early stages of their sexual journey – are so complex and unresolved about their erotic style or orientation that they cannot comfortably communicate verbally or sexually with others. Others know what they do or don’t want, and who they are sexually, but find it hard to communicate that. It is always important for each partner to be clear and unambiguous about their own feelings and preferences and to treat the other with respect and compassion, without coercion. Unfortunately, it takes time to learn all this, and the trial and error can be painful. Since this situation has already ended badly, it may be best that you do not engage with him again, except to say (if you haven’t already) something along the lines of: “I am mortified that you felt I was pressuring you. I am so sorry if I did anything to make you feel that way.” Moving on, any time in the future that you feel an uncomfortable or ambiguous vibe –especially from someone who seems unable to communicate verbally with you – even if you desire them greatly, withdraw respectfully.</p> <ul> <li><p>Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don’t send attachments).

The Reaganites who used to dominate the party mostly saw government as the problem: if only it could be cut back or eliminated entirely, free markets would deliver everything America needed. But a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/07/22/trump-2025-radical-plan-second-term\">new report</a> on plans being developed for Donald Trump’s possible return to the White House shows just how much this has changed. Rather than sidelining or eliminating federal agencies, Republicans now want to do something much more disturbing: seize effective control of them in order to persecute their enemies and implement a radical agenda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/us-democracy-summer-most-consequential\">This summer may be one of the most consequential in US democracy | Thomas Zimmer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the core of the new plan, as reported by Axios, is the intention to strip away employment protections from thousands of senior civil servants, eliminating at a stroke a large chunk of the civil service’s expertise and institutional memory. This would allow them to be replaced with a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/america-first-trumpism-beyond-trump\">cadre</a>” loyal to Trump’s America First agenda, most of them likely to be 20- and 30-somethings with no experience in government who would owe their newfound prominence to Trump alone. Ideologically zealous and loyal to a fault, they would set about trying to reshape the government in Trump’s image.</p> <p>Whoever developed this plan certainly had a keen eye for Trump’s greatest weakness as president. He hollowed out some agencies, particularly the state department, by driving staff to leave. But ignorant of how government worked and too impulsive to stay focused on a long-term program of change, he had little success at actually forcing most agencies to implement his America First agenda. Often, it seemed like Trump considered his own government to be more useful to him as a political foil than as a tool in his hands. Trump appeared to have decided there was little point to trying to actually control the “deep state” when he could instead portray himself as its victim.</p> <p>What seems to have changed in the interim is Trump’s desire for revenge. According to the Axios report, Trump’s top priority in a new administration will be to “clean house” in the intelligence community, DoJ and FBI. Loyalists will be installed in the place of current leadership. Why these places? The standard conservative critique of the civil service is that everyone in it is a liberal, but that certainly isn’t true of these agencies. Rather, they’re the places you need to corrupt if you’re bent on breaking the law and persecuting your opponents. Trump – notoriously thin-skinned, impulsive, and vengeful – wants to do just that.</p> <p>But this isn’t just a problem limited to Trump. The conservative movement as a whole increasingly dreams of turning the state against its enemies. The people at the heart of the movement today are more likely to idolize <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/20/conservatives-republicans-cpac-hungary-orban\">the Hungarian autocrat</a> Viktor Orbán than they are Ronald Reagan. They aren’t animated by the belief that the job of government is simply to get out of the way – instead, they want to use it to impose a radical agenda on American society. And the recent overturning of Roe v Wade provides a blueprint for how a compliant conservative judiciary can enable government officials to take away even the most fundamental of human rights.</p> <p>What will be done with this power? Some of it is grimly predictable. With the Department of Justice finally under control, the next Republican president would be free to launch criminal inquiries into political opponents. The brutality of immigration enforcement would be sharply increased while environmental regulations would languish unenforced. Rightwing extremists would go unmolested while American Muslims had their rights abused. Corruption and venality would become rampant across the government as checks and balances were removed and inexperienced hacks had their first taste of power.</p> <p>Given the scale of the federal government and the sheer weirdness of conservative politics, other consequences are hard to fathom. Be it vaccines, Disney movies, or whatever else is agitating the Fox News faithful, the government would be much more responsive to their views. At the same time, the things that actually matter – from nuclear safety to protecting the country from terrorist attacks – would go neglected. A civil service bent to the will of the modern conservative movement would not be a place that respected science, rationality, or legality. Precisely what might give under the weight of an attack on these principles is difficult to predict. But something definitely would.</p> <p>Although Trump would bring his own particular set of grievances to the venture, any future Republican president is likely to follow a similar blueprint. Given the sheer scale of changes they want to impose on America, today’s conservatives act more like revolutionaries. And like all revolutionaries, they want to seize control of the state and launch an offensive on as many fronts as possible. If Trump’s first term isn’t to appear to future historians as a grim prelude to something far worse, they must never be allowed to do it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States and host of the podcast America Explained</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T10:16:58Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 160 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-160-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 160 of the invasion","trailText":"US announces more weapons for Ukraine as UN chief warns that nuclear annihilation just ‘one miscalculation’ away","byline":"Nicola Slawson, Martin Belam and Samantha Lock","body":"<ul> <li><p><strong>The US announced on Monday a new tranche of weapons for Ukraine’s forces fighting Russia, including ammunition for increasingly important rocket launchers and artillery guns.</strong> The $550m package will “include more ammunition for the high mobility advanced rocket systems otherwise known as Himars, as well as ammunition” for artillery, national security council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p></li> <li><p>Russian defence minister <strong>Sergei Shoigu</strong> has said that Russia had destroyed six US-made Himars missile systems since the beginning of the latest Russian invasion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Three people have reportedly been killed by Russian shelling while evacuating in a minibus near Kherson, Ukraine’s military is reporting. </strong>Ukraine’s Operational Command ‘South’ reported that three people died from the attack on the bus near Dovhove.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Turkey’s representative at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul has said that the first ship carrying Ukrainian grain to world markets was expected to anchor at Istanbul on Tuesday night. </strong>At a briefing held at the JCC, general <strong>Özcan Altunbulak</strong> said the course of the ship was going as planned.

At least we know there’s more of them to come …","byline":"Stuart Heritage","body":"<p><em>Warning: this article contains spoilers to season six, episode 11 of Better Call Saul. Do not read on if you haven’t watched</em></p> <p>One of Better Call Saul’s signature moves is to give us things we want in ways that make us instantly regret wanting them. Take two weeks ago, for instance. Since its inception, Better Call Saul viewers had been itching to see the moment where lovable but flawed Jimmy McGill burst into flames and emerged as Breaking Bad’s amoral Saul Goodman.</p> <p>But when that moment finally came – in a smash-cut flash-forward at the climax of one of the most devastatingly emotional sequences of the entire series – it felt like a bereavement. Saul had arrived, but long before we could process the grief of losing Jimmy. Say what you like about Peter Gould and Vince Gilligan, but they really know how to punish people.</p> <p>This week, they’ve done it again. The reappearance of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul has been a fundamental piece of Better Call Saul legend. And Gould and Gilligan had primed us for their arrival long in advance. They even had the brass balls to name this episode Breaking Bad (as a nod to the Breaking Bad season two episode Better Call Saul), for crying out loud. This whole thing has been a breadcrumb trail designed to destroy the internet. How could such an agonisingly awaited cameo be anything other than a glorious lap of honour?</p> <p>But when it came, once again, it felt slightly empty. The Walt and Jesse scene was basically an addendum to an old Breaking Bad scene; where Saul is taken out to the desert and pleads for his life. True, it’s an important moment – it’s the Rosetta Stone for the entire arc of Better Call Saul, referencing Lalo and Nacho Salamanca for the first time – but the epilogue we were treated to amounted to little more than small talk. Yes, it was a thrill to see Cranston and Paul back as their most indelible characters (especially Paul, revelling in Jesse’s snotty snarkiness after the bleakness of El Camino), but other than that it felt like flat fan service.</p> <p>It’s hard, too, to know what long-absent Breaking Bad fans would have made of everything that surrounded it. The Walt and Jesse scene was folded into another black-and-white flash-forward episode, with Gene Takavic slowly duping a sequence of drunks for no immediate cause. Last week’s instalment, another full-length black-and-white Takavic scam, was (wrongly) called the worst Better Call Saul episode ever by others. The people who said this have had years to tune themselves into Better Call Saul’s deliberate pace. Anyone who came into this week’s episode blind, just to get a hit of the old propulsive Breaking Bad energy, may well have been entirely mystified by its slow adherence to process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25e4ba3bf9eda981d08a648b5ba9cd327eb9e009\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25e4ba3bf9eda981d08a648b5ba9cd327eb9e009/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) inspects Walt and Jesse’s equipment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) inspects Walt and Jesse’s equipment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, it’s important to state that this was a terrific episode. To love Better Call Saul is to keep an eye on the bigger picture. For instance, Howard Hamlin’s death, as shocking as it was, came at the end of seven episodes of meticulous, translucent plotting. It feels as if something similar is at play here. One of the drunks has cancer, which is absolutely not a coincidence. Carol Burnett’s character, Marion, (especially now she has access to the internet), appears to be teetering on the brink of figuring out Gene’s true identity. And let’s not forget the call in the phone booth. The audio was muted, but Jimmy was visibly agitated. Was he learning something new about Kim? Was he talking to Kim? Surely this will all be resolved in the next couple of hours of television.</p> <p>Plus, I can’t help but feel like the Breaking Bad scenes were designed as a curveball. Cranston has let it slip that he and Paul filmed three scenes for Better Call Saul; one together then one each separately. Of these three, we have only seen the first. The episode ended with Saul Goodman ready to confront Walter White in his school (a scene which also took place in the same Breaking Bad episode as the desert encounter), so we almost certainly haven’t seen the last of the pair.</p> <p>But who knows? The joy of these last few Better Call Saul episodes is that the show is already done. Fun and Games, the episode from a fortnight ago, pretty much wrapped things up for everyone. It explained exactly what happened to Jimmy, Kim, Gus and Mike. So this final clutch of episodes is working from a completely blank slate. Next week’s penultimate episode might be all about Gene, or all about Walter White, or maybe even Marion. We are in uncharted territory here. As fun as it was to see Cranston and Paul back bickering in their Bounder, nothing will be as exciting as whatever lies ahead. God, I’m going to miss this show.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/japan-may-rethink-reporting-of-covid-cases-as-subvariant-hits-hard","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T10:05:43Z","webTitle":"Japan may rethink reporting of Covid cases as subvariant hits hard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/japan-may-rethink-reporting-of-covid-cases-as-subvariant-hits-hard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/japan-may-rethink-reporting-of-covid-cases-as-subvariant-hits-hard","fields":{"headline":"Japan may rethink reporting of Covid cases as subvariant hits hard","trailText":"Tokyo considers measures to ease pressure on hospitals as country struggles to contain outbreak","byline":"Justin McCurry in Tokyo","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> could soon overhaul its battle against coronavirus to relieve pressure on hospitals as it struggles to cope with its biggest outbreak since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>Japan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/from-near-disaster-to-success-story-how-japan-has-tackled-coronavirus\">fared comparatively well</a> during the pandemic, with about 32,000 deaths among a population of 126 million, but has recently reported more than 200,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> cases a day – more than any other country – as the BA.5 subvariant hits.</p> <p>Experts say the recent surge is being driven by children and people under 20, who comprised almost a third of new infections in July, with those under 30 accounting for about half of all new cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government is reportedly considering changing the protocol for reporting new cases to lower the burden on health services, which collect case data. Some officials have questioned the need to report every case – an approach that raises pressure on hospitals and keeps people off work if they are required to isolate as close contacts of infected people.</p> <p>Some businesses and local government officials are also calling for authorities to reclassify the virus – which belongs to the same category as tuberculosis – so that it is regarded in the same way as flu, amid evidence that the BA.5 subvariant of Covid-19 produces milder cases than previous strains, said the Kyodo news agency.</p> <p>Japan reported a record 233,100 cases last Thursday; during the week up to Monday it confirmed more than 1.4m new infections – a 1.3-fold increase from the previous week – to bring its total caseload to almost 13m.</p> <p>Most people under 60 are not yet eligible for a fourth jab, while younger people have been slow to receive their third. In addition, only 17% of children between five and 11 have received two doses since vaccinations for that age group began in February, according to the prime minister’s office website.</p> <p>More than 60% of Japanese have received three jabs, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/why-are-masks-still-worn-in-japan-and-south-korea-covid\">mask-wearing is still widespread</a>, but health experts believe cases are rising because it has been several months since many people had their last vaccination.</p> <p>Pandemic fatigue has also helped drive the latest wave, according to Akimasa Hirata, a professor at the Nagoya Institute of Technology. “Unlike last year, we are not seeing a decrease in the number of people out and about despite an increase in infections,” Hirata told the Kyodo news agency. “Cases may remain high as the vaccine’s efficacy among the working-age population is declining.”</p> <p>Japan has never ordered lockdowns but has periodically called on people to avoid travel and non-essential outings, and imposed fines on businesses in the night-time economy that ignore requests to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/19/tokyo-alcohol-ban-covid-lockdown-izakayas-shimbashi\">close early and restrict alcohol sales</a>.</p> <p>The government is reluctant to call on people to restrict their movements or to reintroduce curbs on bar and restaurant opening hours. Instead, it will leave it to regional authorities to decide their own measures, with a focus on protecting older and medically vulnerable people.</p> <p>“Rather than a national response, we want to support regional authorities’ responses that are based on local situations,” said the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Seiji Kihara. “It’s important is to help each prefecture’s social and economic activities.”</p> <p>While there have been fewer deaths than during previous Covid waves, the number of critically ill people is rising in some parts of the country, Kyodo said.</p> <p>The occupancy rate of beds set aside for Covid patients in Tokyo has risen to more than 50%, it said, as the capital on Monday reported more than 20,000 new cases for the 13th day running.</p> <p>The city of Osaka recently urged older residents to avoid non-essential outings until the latest wave subsides, while people in the southern prefecture of Okinawa have been asked to do the same until the middle of the month.</p> <p>The rise in infections has also caused disruption to sectors of the economy.

The global climate crisis and decades of sprawling urban growth has turned this desert city into a hazardous heat island with dwindling water supplies and inadequate shade.</p> <p>An assortment of programs to cool down Phoenix and help people survive the heat have not been working: in Maricopa county, which includes Phoenix, record high temperatures contributed to at least 662 deaths between 2020 and 2021, while thousands more people needed emergency medical treatment.</p> <p>That’s where the city’s new Office of Heat Response and Mitigation comes in. The pioneering heat team was created last September amid pressure from activists, researchers, faith groups and health experts for a dedicated team responsible – and accountable – for making Phoenix more livable.</p> <p>David Hondula, a climate and health researcher at Arizona State University, was hired to lead the four-person team and coordinate the city’s immediate efforts to cut heat deaths and illness, and come up with ways to cool the city and make it more comfortable in the long term. It’s the first local government funded heat team in North America, possibly the world. “It’s a long game – we’re fighting for small wins that we hope will accumulate into larger wins,” said Hondula. “We need to prepare for and recover from every summer, not occasional heatwaves.”</p> <p>The Guardian spent a day with the Phoenix heat team during one of the hottest spells of the year so far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ca1892d35ece4682f5e7a2b49b08d695d7ecb1b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca1892d35ece4682f5e7a2b49b08d695d7ecb1b2/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr David Hondula walks with volunteer Ray Miller during a shift of outreach.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"83e213e7a707a27e13a2475ff95c7c96c01c21a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83e213e7a707a27e13a2475ff95c7c96c01c21a9/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers pack carts with ice, towels and water to give to people struggling in the extreme heat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top: Dr David Hondula walks with volunteer Ray Miller during a shift of outreach.

Reaching unsheltered people when it’s very hot is critical to reducing the city’s death toll.</p> <p>Four times a week, every Tuesday and Thursday morning and afternoon, a city outreach team hands out essential supplies – cold water, cooling towels, hats and sunscreen – to anyone struggling outside. (They also provide supplies to faith groups and concerned citizens who have been doing this work for years.)</p> <p>The outreach is coordinated by the heat office and the city’s volunteers programme, with 120 sessions scheduled for this summer, compared with just eight or 10 in previous years. A case worker from the city’s homeless team is on every shift, to help connect people with information on services like emergency shelters, free medical care, shower facilities and food – if they are ready. “Don’t assume what people want, keep it open ended,” Victor Rojas, a case manager, told the volunteers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b966f260ea45aa28be3e98bd4e3f0c0483098de6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b966f260ea45aa28be3e98bd4e3f0c0483098de6/0_0_5308_3626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of tents and makeshift shelters in the afternoon heat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of tents and makeshift shelters in the afternoon heat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team can help organise transport to a nearby cooling centre: there’s a network of city and non-profit spaces (libraries, churches, day centres etc) that mostly operate during business hours (rather than the hottest times of the day/night), and aren’t all that easy to find. Yet even though cooling centres have operated in the city for years, many people who need them – including first responders and convenience store workers who have regular contact with the most vulnerable people – have no idea where they are. Changing this through better messaging is something Hondula describes as “low-hanging fruit” – small interventions that could render big wins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"88f796415c3fe20b05972bfd7f828f663eb294a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88f796415c3fe20b05972bfd7f828f663eb294a9/0_0_3264_1303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Left: City of Phoenix caseworker Mia Stanford gives out a cooling towel.

Hondula was in high demand with journalists that day, and took time out for three interviews. “If the lack of attention to heat as a hazard is one reason why it’s under-resourced nationally, then getting the word out is a good use of my time for our community and others.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07ea4980e5f4d05863d9eacb998165e703c4cef9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07ea4980e5f4d05863d9eacb998165e703c4cef9/0_0_8040_5360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Hondula, director of the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, takes a call from a reporter about rumors that Joe Biden will soon declare a nationwide climate emergency.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Hondula, director of the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, takes a call from a reporter about rumors that Joe Biden will soon declare a nationwide climate emergency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>The climate crisis requires a coordinated global effort to slash greenhouse gas emissions, in order to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. As political leaders fight but fail to take urgent action, cities like Phoenix must find ways to adapt to and mitigate the impact of extreme weather. That means lots of meetings to share data, ideas and solutions on how best to cool the city.</p> <p>Top of the list is increasing canopy cover to cool the city, especially in the poorest mostly Black and brown neighbourhoods, which have the fewest trees and most people without cars and air conditioning. Lora Martens, a landscape architect and expert in desert plants, is the team’s urban tree programme manager, whose job is to work out the most effective and sustainable way to reduce the heat island effect and make people more comfortable. “We need so many trees for so many reasons, there is such a deficit here, but not all trees are the same. The hardest part is planting the right trees in the places that need them most. It’s not easy or cheap.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a71ae373391136e63a0e156e915ca7d491738f4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a71ae373391136e63a0e156e915ca7d491738f4d/0_0_7985_5323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signs advertising a tree planting program lean against Lora Martens’ desk at the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signs advertising a tree planting program lean against Lora Martens’ desk at the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Martens led the team’s first meeting on updating the city’s 2010 tree and shade master plan, which pledged 25% cover by 2030: no one is sure where that figure came from and what’s been achieved so far. More work needs to be done to ensure mass tree planting helps rather than worsens the region’s water shortages; also crucial is community outreach to understand – rather than assume – what people in tree-deprived neighbourhoods want and need.</p> <p>But it’s not all about trees: shade can also be engineered, so structures like awnings could be the more costly but best short-term solution to protect people quickly.</p> <p>“In places that people need shade now, we can’t plant trees and hope they get to adulthood in 20 years,” said Mary Wright, the team’s built environment specialist.</p> <p>In the long term, building codes will have to change. “In Phoenix we’ve definitely lost touch designing for the climate over choosing cheaper solutions because we have air conditioning.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e773753eaf4ec7603dc9c5fa1c45cc3e1d19695\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e773753eaf4ec7603dc9c5fa1c45cc3e1d19695/2169_0_4403_5504/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Wright, a climate scientist and data specialist with the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, at city hall.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Wright, a climate scientist and data specialist with the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, at city hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9230040b0078773c189f2c9f1abb75eebe748887\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9230040b0078773c189f2c9f1abb75eebe748887/0_0_5454_8181/667.jpg\" alt=\"A map of Phoenix’s city council districts.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A map of Phoenix’s city council districts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin O’Hara/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As part of the city’s first heat response plan, the team will evaluate the 31 heat-related programmes and services the city is involved in, from cooling centres and outreach work to cooling pavements and tree planting.</p> <p>A big part of that is understanding what works and what doesn’t on the ground, but as academics the team lack first-hand street experience.

Arguably every preventable death is a failure so this is shocking, but not all that surprising given the sharp rise in drug use, evictions, energy bills and homelessness.</p> <p>“Protecting people is not just about providing people with better weather information. If we want to focus on the big pieces of the pie in Phoenix, then drugs and housing are a lot of it,” he said.</p> <p>In some ways, the buck now stops with him. “It’s motivation … the public health community says that heat related deaths are preventable, there’s no asterisk or exceptions for high inflation or homelessness.

It’s no disturbance to Bragg – on the contrary, he’s been receiving constant updates on the match throughout his set. Whooping and yelling, he immediately leads the audience in a rousing rendition of Jerusalem. Having already ranted passionately about trans rights, global warming and male violence, he expounds on why we should all rejoice in England’s win.</p> <p>It’s an apt microcosm of a thoroughly good-natured event. Cambridge Folk festival is essentially celebrating its very survival after the pandemic, and the audience flocks to tai chi and willow-weaving workshops to discover, with no small sense of relief, that the easy charm that has sustained this compact festival for 57 years has been unharmed by a two-year hiatus.</p> <p>That’s partly because this year’s is a relatively safe bill, one heavily reliant on the tried-and-trusted names with none of the edgy Nick Caves or Julian Copes of recent years. Instead, there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/13/clannad-theme-from-harrys-game\">Clannad</a>, now into the third year of their farewell tour; the feverish Spanish rhythms of Gipsy Kings; Show of Hands leading the crowd in rousing choruses; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/seasick-steve\">Seasick Steve</a> thrashing out his inimitable blues with characteristic eccentricity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbe48b518fa819a37534de12231cfc174009ed17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbe48b518fa819a37534de12231cfc174009ed17/0_515_7769_4664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seasick Steve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thrashing out his inimitable blues … Seasick Steve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Parsons Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Warmly applauded for her top hat before she has even sung a note, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/suzanne-vega\">Suzanne Vega</a> delivers a consummately intimate set that even includes a fetching cover of Lou Reed’s Walk on the Wild Side. It would have been the festival’s best cover version were it not for the Spooky Men’s Chorale’s wondrous reinvention of Bohemian Rhapsody as a saucy cowboy song. The reliably entertaining Australian choir also provide the weekend’s most emotional contributions with two traditional Ukrainian songs.</p> <p>Where Cambridge Folk gets adventurous is in its more global-leaning bookings. Afro Celt Sound System have been through a myriad of changes since Simon Emmerson dreamed up their groundbreaking mix of Irish and African music in the mid-90s, but the spectacular sight of Johnny Kalsi attacking his dhol drums still stirs the blood. N’famady Kouyaté from Guinea is a highlight, attacking his balafon – a resilient form of wooden xylophone – with impressive frenzy while a large band blazes away behind him. There’s sheer joy, too, in the exhilarating Chilean band Chico Trujillo, and the ebullient American roots rockers Dustbowl Revival, full of big, chunky brass and an exceptional singer in Lashon Halley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5141ff8adb63f88b721595837135329a2f2f020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5141ff8adb63f88b721595837135329a2f2f020/0_263_8256_5241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dustbowl Revival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ebullient … Dustbowl Revival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Parsons Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That said, looking back often proves fruitful. The Mary Wallopers invokes the raucous ghosts of the Dubliners and the Pogues to startling effect and Scotland’s Elephant Sessions lift the roof with relentless Celtic rock of an older vintage. New band the Magpie Arc show that old dogs can learn new tricks with venerable acoustic guitar master Martin Simpson going electric. Meanwhile, the unaccompanied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/06/great-dynasties-copper-family-folk\">Copper Family</a> – the most venerable name in English traditional song – showcase their newest generation of family singers.

So much that we’ve worked for in places like Teesside would be undone.” </p> <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/02/rees-mogg-denies-truss-plans-cut-public-sector-pay-outside-london\">has denied Truss plans</a> to slash the pay of public sector workers outside the capital by introducing regional pay boards, as senior figures questioned how billions of promised savings could be made. The original policy release from Truss said it could be “adopted for all public sector workers in the long term”.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg, a backer of Truss and the minister in charge of civil service efficiencies, said it was “not the plan at the moment” to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/liz-truss-plan-to-cut-11bn-in-whitehall-waste-ludicrous\">cut pay for the wider public sector</a> to make savings of £8.8bn promised by Truss. “The discussion at the moment is around civil servants,” he said.</p> <p>The most significant element of the plan is the introduction of regional pay boards, which Truss said would “tailor pay to the cost of living where civil servants actually work”. She claimed this would save up to £8.8bn.</p> <p>Experts questioned whether the savings were feasible. Alex Thomas, a programme director at the Institute for Government thinktank, said the whole annual civil service pay bill was about £9bn.</p> <p>Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said it would make civil service recruitment more difficult. “The civil service is already struggling to recruit and retain employees in the face of crippling pay cuts, threats of redundancy and continuous attacks from ministers,” he said.</p> <p>“Making working for the civil service even less attractive by reducing leave, cutting pay for people outside of London, and removing roles dedicated to reducing inequality will only make recruitment harder and leave us unable to provide vital services.”</p> <p>In a revised statement, Truss’s campaign said it was “the potential savings if the system were to be adopted for all public sector workers in the long term” – which would include public sector employees such as teachers and nurses.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg said it was right to save money by moving civil servants out of London. “You don’t have the London weighting or the London allowance. And property costs are lower outside London. These are really important benefits.</p> <p>“And it ties in with levelling up because you’re moving the jobs out of London. But at the same time we need a smaller civil service. We have 91,000 more people working for the civil service than we did in 2016. You need to get back to the 2016 level. That on its own will save about £3.5bn, potentially more.”</p> <p>Thomas said the figures did not add up if applied only to civil servants. “It’s going to come from the wider public sector, it’s going to come from nurses and teachers and local authorities,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the “complicated and controversial” move would mean nurses and teachers being paid less or receiving slower pay rises than others, adding: “This is not war on Whitehall, it’s more like war on Workington.”</p> <p>Rees-Mogg also said Truss would be right to rid the civil service of all diversity and inclusion programmes. “We had a training programme called <a href=\"https://checkyoself.info/checkyoprivilege/\">Check Yo’Privilege</a> – what on earth is that? Why are we wasting people’s time with a course that doesn’t help people do their jobs better?</p> <p>“What do we want from the civil service? We want people to get their passports on time.

It is, or at least should be, criminal where it is done by corporations or governments intentionally or recklessly,” he said.<br></p> \n  <p>“So instead of a short-lived Twitter backlash and a revolving door taking you from politics into a six-figure consultancy, if you gladhand a fossil fuel project that screws our collective future you get 20 years in jail. That sounds more fair to me. That’s accountability I’d vote for. Why don’t we backdate it to today?”<br></p> \n  <p>The former NSW state politician noted that the Labor government held 26 of the 76 seats in the Senate, and hinted at proposals to use that political calculus – and the Green’s position in the balance of power – to “provide far greater scrutiny, transparency and accountability of the executive”.<br></p> \n  <p>Shoebridge mentioned the NSW parliament’s public accountability committee, which is investigating the appointment of former deputy premier John Barilaro to a New York trade commissioner post. The senator said it was an example of parliamentary structures working “to force accountability on an unwilling government”.<br></p> \n  <p>“Whatever else it is, NSW politics sure is a masterclass in scandal, corruption and abuse of power, lessons that will certainly come in useful here,” Shoebridge said.<br><br>He ended his speech with the words: “We have a planet to save, so let’s get started.”<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T08:09:12.171Z\">at 9.09am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e8d6cf8f08af33ff4a58ec\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T07:51:32.733Z\">8.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tony Burke calls a vote on bill to scrap cashless debit card</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/1554372520899678209\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/breaking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#breaking</a> Tony Burke has used his new \"urgent bills\" procedure to call a vote on Labor's bill to scrap the cashless debit card.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a></p>— Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/1554372520899678209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Paul_Karp/status/1554374698330628096\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sorry, still getting head around new rules.

We live in unprecedented times. Generations before us faced their own unprecedented times – world wars, famines, pandemics, natural disasters. </em></p> \n   <p><em>Many of our forebears put their lives on the line to build what they saw as a brighter future.

Extreme weather: drought, bushfires, hailstorms and floods are having a devastating effect on the people and places we love. <strong>We are also seeing the impacts on the state of the environment. The 6th mass extinction event is underway. The last one, 66 million years ago, was due to a massive asteroid. This time we’re causing it.</strong></em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Earlier, Pocock spoke about the diversity of Canberra:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Despite what you may see on the news, Canberra is so much more than the sum of the decisions made in this building. Yes, we are a city of roundabouts and politicians.

We’re appropriately called the bush capital ... We have a vibrant and growing multicultural community.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also called for territories to regain the right to legislate, carefully tiptoeing to avoid the phrase “voluntary assisted dying”:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Here in the ACT we have been denied rights held by the states. It is time for us to restore the right of the territories to make decisions for themselves. To ensure that our legislative assembly here in the ACT gets to make decisions about the future of Canberrans, not MPs from around the country whose own constituents already enjoy these same rights. </em></p> \n   <p><em>Yesterday, legislation to restore our rights as a Territory was introduced into the House of Representatives. This is not the first time the parliament has tried to repeal the Andrews bill. But I hope it will be the last. </em></p> \n   <p><em>I will work with everyone in this Senate chamber to support a vote giving us equality with the states. I would like to acknowledge the many brave, courageous people who have supported this campaign over many years.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Other issues canvassed include the housing crisis, workforce shortages, increasing transparency and integrity in government, the protection of whistleblowers, and enshrining a First Nations Voice in the constitution.</p> \n  <p>There was a controversy last week about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/29/act-senator-pocock-denied-auslan-interpreter-for-maiden-speech-in-senate\">whether Pocock would be allowed an Auslan sign language interpreter</a>.

I make a number of comments about the target. </p> \n   <p>The prime minister has made clear repeatedly we went to the election with that target and sought a mandate and received a mandate for that target. It is important to the prime minister and this side of the House to maintain the commitments that we made during the election. </p> \n   <p>Professor <strong>Mark Howden</strong> of the AMU Centre for Climate and Energy and Disaster Recovery and a vice-chair of the IPCC has said a 43% reductions target is entirely consistent with the obligations set out at the Glasgow conference last year and consistent with Australia’s obligations under the Glasgow conference. </p> \n   <p>Another point I would make ... is that targets are very important. But even more important than targets are the policies underpinning it. When we released the 43% reduction target, it was the modelled result of the range of policies we committed to at the time. </p> \n   <p>They are easier said than met. It is important to accompany targets with the policy. </p> \n   <p>Whether it is safeguards reforms, Rewiring the Nation policies, reforming [the] electric vehicle tax cut and electric vehicle strategies which will give the Australians the [chance] to buy electric vehicles and enjoy the weekend at the same time, community batteries, solar banks policy ... the range of policies is important and we are getting on and implementing them all. </p> \n   <p>The other thing important to get the investment in renewable energy is certainty and policy frameworks being legislated. </p> \n   <p>I thank the member for Wentworth for her public announcement that she will be supporting our legislation in the House. It sends the message that not only does Australia now have a government that gets it, we have a parliament that gets it too. </p> \n   <p>It will provide policy certainty and framework for investors around the world who see Australia as an opportunity ... because we want Australia to be a renewable energy powerhouse, we want Australia to take advantage of those economic opportunities because we see the world’s climate emergency, and there is one, as Australia’s jobs opportunity.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08f41d9aaa196def1a0d667f11dec522877f4a99\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08f41d9aaa196def1a0d667f11dec522877f4a99/237_131_7026_4711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minister for climate change Chris Bowen during question time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minister for climate change Chris Bowen during question time.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T05:25:55.107Z\">at 6.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e8ac808f08af33ff4a57da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T04:50:11.588Z\">5.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Albanese: jobs and skills summit will address skills shortage impact on business</strong></p> \n  <p>Back to question time,<strong> Paul Fletcher </strong>has a question for <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Will the government support the Coalition’s policy to help veterans and pensioners who may choose to work more hours to help fill vacancies in sectors like aged care, agriculture, hospitality and home care?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Albanese:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the things that the jobs and skills subsidy is going to address is bringing unions, employers, and civil society together to discuss how we address the acute skills shortages impacting on business. </p> \n   <p>One way that we can do it ...

NSW captain <strong>Pat Conroy</strong> assembled a formidable squad including Albanese, <strong>Michael McCormack, Alex Hawke, “Big Dan” Repacholi</strong> and Channel Nine commentator/NRLW star <strong>Ruan Sims</strong>; Queensland captain, sports minister <strong>Anika Wells</strong>, led a team including <strong>Murray Watt</strong>, Nationals leader <strong>David Littleproud, Graham Perrett</strong>, NRL CEO <strong>Andrew Abdo</strong>, and, controversially, ACT senator <strong>David Pocock</strong>.<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The greatest scandal since [<strong>Greg Inglis</strong>] playing for Queensland,” Albanese joked in a Channel Nine interview from the sidelines.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(To be fair, Pocock lived in Queensland first, after moving from South Africa as a child, before moving to the ACT. <strong>Barnaby Joyce,</strong> now representing the NSW seat of New England, also ran out for Queensland.)<br></p> \n  <p>With 6 foot 8 Repacholi, Wallabies international Pocock, and a handful of Canberra Raiders stars on the field, the game was arguably the most fearsome sight seen on the Senate fields since Senator <strong>Glenn “Brick with Eyes” Lazarus</strong> terrorised the press v pollies games during the 44th parliament.<br></p> \n  <p>Queensland scored the first try, and looked dangerous, with Perrett a livewire from the back of the ruck, Pocock giving good service from dummy half and Joyce trying to throw a few dummy passes. But NSW steamed back to score three in a row, with Albanese scoring the third on the stroke of halftime.<br></p> \n  <p>Queensland players including Nationals MP <strong>Keith Pitt</strong> jeered from the sidelines, accusing Wells of letting Albanese slip through to plant the ball down. Wells swore she got a touch on the PM before he scored, with Watt – a close Albanese ally – accusing his boss of claiming a “dodgy try”.<br></p> \n  <p>Watt joked about he handing in his resignation.

In one corner of the ground a mound of grass cuttings is allowed to slowly rot, the perfect habitat for grass snakes, although club chairperson Mike Hill confesses he has been reluctant to check whether any have moved in.</p> <p>Last year, the club won the <a href=\"https://www.thecricketer.com/Topics/club-cricket-guide/boundary_view_whalley_range_are_green_pioneers.html\">Cricketer magazine’s inaugural UK Greenest Ground award</a> for its work encouraging biodiversity.

Vegetables grow in large wooden planters and there are plans to go completely plastic free.</p> <p>“The neighbours love it,” says Hill. “You want to spend time here with the colour and the calm.” As a sport, he says, cricket is more vulnerable than most to the weather, and last year the club had to water the square in April, yet saw fixtures regularly washed out in June. “Climate change is very clear when you play cricket,” he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae516cf2cdba1c6702fc588f372e33c9e1931261\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae516cf2cdba1c6702fc588f372e33c9e1931261/51_197_5105_3803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers at Whalley Range Cricket Club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flowers flourish at Whalley Range cricket club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hillsdon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the UK, sports clubs are starting to do their bit for biodiversity, forgoing the urge to cut back and tidy, and allowing nature to take over. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/18/environmentally-friendly-golf-courses-lucy-siegle\">golf courses</a>, for years dubbed “green deserts” by conservationists, are changing.</p> <p>James Hutchinson, membership services manager for ecology and sustainability at the <a href=\"https://www.bigga.org.uk/\">British and International Golf Greenkeepers Association</a>, recalls widespread spraying of pesticides in the 1980s. “I remember thinking then, you’re killing everything off just to have a playing field for golf,” he says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ngf.org/golf-around-the-world/\">The UK has about 3,000 registered golf courses,</a> many of which border important biodiversity hotspots such as sand dunes, heaths and chalk downlands. Hutchinson’s job is to help these clubs manage their courses more naturally.</p> <p>Many pesticides are now banned, so clubs are having to find alternatives, Hutchinson says. For instance, leatherjackets – cranefly larvae – are a real problem on fairways as they eat the roots of grass. Badgers and crows forage for the leatherjackets, causing more problems. So several clubs have installed starling nest boxes to encourage the birds on to the courses because their slender beaks can grab the insects without damaging the turf.</p> <p>Golf even has <a href=\"https://golfenvironmentawards.com/\">its own environmental awards</a> and this year’s winners included Newquay golf club, where an ecological rough management plan has seen wildflowers such as cranesbill, scabious and knapweed flourish and provide food for pollinators like such as the dark green fritillary and six-spot burnet moth. Weybrook Park golf club, near Basingstoke, has introduced skylark protection areas, roped-off zones that members have been happy to give over to the ground-nesting bird.</p> <p>Water is the next big issue for clubs. “A number of courses may be still using mains irrigation but they’re a dying breed,” says Hutchinson, who is working with clubs to drill boreholes and create rainwater reservoirs to meet their irrigation needs, as well as growing more drought-tolerant types of grass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a5bc4676c92e80438333db94e836f5dabb92169\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a5bc4676c92e80438333db94e836f5dabb92169/0_0_1548_1161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tractors on a green area by the side of a road in Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Scotland, the Irvine to Girvan Nectar Network hopes to link golf courses with local nature reserves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Bates/Scottish Wildlife Trust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Scottish Wildlife Trust has been working with clubs and the golfing charity the FairWays Foundation, which is co-funding the <a href=\"https://scottishwildlifetrust.org.uk/our-work/our-projects/irvine-to-girvan-nectar-network/\">Irvine to Girvan Nectar Network</a>, a project to bring wildflower meadows back to the Ayrshire coast.</p> <p>Network co-ordinator Lynne Bates is visiting clubs along the coast and supplying flower seeds that can help to create one continuous corridor, linking the courses with local nature reserves. The project is already making an impact, she says, with the return of the small blue to Ayrshire for the first time since the 1980s. Britain’s most diminutive butterfly needs kidney vetch for its caterpillars, and the plant is now abundant across many courses in Scotland and other coastal courses in the UK.</p> <p>“Just tweaking the management of an area can make a huge difference,” says Bates. “Let it get a bit untidy because it’s those long, slightly overgrown, slightly wild-looking areas that wildlife like.”</p> <p>Flat sandy bunkers, with at least one edge left uncut are “invertebrate sun traps”, she says, recalling how one greenkeeper recently tweeted that solitary mining bees had taken up residence in one of his bunkers. Not long ago, they would have been seen as a pest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f24750dfab328d4204ba0d59410595baed876fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f24750dfab328d4204ba0d59410595baed876fc/0_0_1548_1161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irvine beach Park Pond Meadow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Scottish Wildlife Trust is working with clubs and the FairWays Foundation to bring wildflower meadows back to the Ayrshire coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Bates/Scottish Wildlife Trust</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everyone is convinced that the changes some golf courses are making is enough. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/greens-new-peer-natalie-bennett-vows-to-carry-on-protesting\">Green party peer Natalie Bennett</a> says: “The kind of [biodiverse-friendly] things they are doing are very small scale and you’ve still got fairways and greens that are a hugely destructive use of land.”</p> <p>Pesticides, energy use, and constant mowing all have a huge environmental impact, she says. “I’m not saying close down every golf course in the country but I think we need to look at land use … and that would mean, very clearly, fewer golf courses, and that land being put to better social and environmental use.”</p> <p>Other sporting clubs are also reassessing their relationship with nature. The Northfield bowling club in Ayr is part of the nectar network and groundsman Kieron Gallagher has created a wildflower meadow on a shady area of grass behind the main stand. As well as stripping back the old turf, he has planted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2012/sep/27/yellow-rattle-meadow-grassland\">yellow rattle</a>, dubbed the meadow maker, a semi-parasitic plant that taps into the roots of grass, weakening it and allowing other wildflowers to take hold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/14/on-the-verge-a-quiet-roadside-revolution-is-boosting-wildflowers-aoe\">On the verge: a quiet roadside revolution is boosting wildflowers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Plants such as eyebright and bartsia perform a similar role and are increasingly used by greenkeepers to thin out rank grassland, where thuggish species such as yorkshire fog and meadow grass have taken over.</p> <p>In addition, traditional roses were grubbed up to make way for another swathe of wildflowers, and the new beds will provide pollen, nectar and a habitat for other insects, says Bates. “It’s a knock-on effect, so those insects coming in will be food for the birds. You need the small stuff at the bottom to feed everything else.”</p> <p>Girvan football club has also joined in, transforming the entrance to its ground with a sensory garden, complete with fruit trees that are attracting pollinators. “It’s trying to showcase how sport and nature can live alongside each other,” says Bates.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Gloucester rugby club has teamed up with the local wildlife trust to install three rainwater gardens at its Kingsholm stadium.

Ten years later the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup was born – a sponsorship deal between a tobacco company and cricket that lasted 30 years.</p> <p>The Sunday League knockabout was sponsored by John Player between 1969 and 1986, ciggies given out willy-nilly in dressing rooms from Headingley to Hove, 1980s all-rounders battled it out for the Silk Cut Challenge, while the 1992 and 1996 Cricket World Cups were sponsored by B&amp;H and Wills cigarettes. So it went on, in as many sports as you could mention, until a ban on tobacco sponsorship and sport kicked in UK-wide in 2002.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/24/cricket-must-act-to-combat-heat-and-sooner-than-had-been-expected\">Cricket must act to combat heat – and sooner than had been expected | Tanya Aldred</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, in 1958, Dr Charles David Keeling, a young geochemist, found evidence that CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the Earth’s atmosphere were rising and attributed it to the burning of fossil fuels. By 1967 scientists had produced the first computer model of Earth’s changing climate, which predicted that a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere would raise global temperatures by two degrees centigrade, and in 1968 a glaciologist was predicting the melting of the polar ice caps.</p> <p>Yet in 2022, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warning the world has to act “now or never” to hold off disaster and keep the rise in temperatures close to 1.5C, the UN secretary general António Guterres warning that fossil fuels companies and their financers “have humanity by the throat”, and the world on the edge of a sixth mass extinction event, fossil fuel companies are embracing sport like never before, hoping for the same glossy sportswashing effect tobacco companies so enjoyed in the 20th century. The 2021 Sweat Not Oil report found 258 sports sponsorship deals with companies promoting high-carbon products services and lifestyles. </p> <p>Cricket is no exception. Emirates Airlines sponsors Old Trafford; the Reliance Group, owner of the world’s largest petrol refining hub, owns the Mumbai Indians, successfully bid for one of the new South African T20 franchise teams and also popped up at the Riverside at the end of July to play a select Durham XI. But perhaps it is Lord’s, the highest-profile ground of all, that has the most throbbing sponsorship headache.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e4645a1e6ce941a5f790fd550b8c2bd4728f2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e4645a1e6ce941a5f790fd550b8c2bd4728f2e4/2342_1405_2364_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lancashire take on Kent at the Emirates Old Trafford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters watch a county game at the Emirates Old Trafford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Wood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The principal partner at Lord’s, and sponsor of the media centre, is JP Morgan Chase. According to a recent report by climate thinktank <a href=\"https://www.edie.net/report-worlds-biggest-finance-firms-gave-fossil-fuel-industry-740bn-of-support-since-2020/\">InfluenceMap</a> assessing the world’s 30 largest financial institutions, JP Morgan was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/25/sir-chris-hohn-urges-shareholders-to-vote-against-greenwashing-bank-directors\">biggest enabler of fossil fuel financing</a> with $81bn in 2020-21. They are also, <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/campaign/stop-banks-funding-climate-chaos/\">according to a separate study</a>, the biggest investor in new fossil fuel exploration: something the International Energy Agency warned in 2021 had to stop immediately if the world’s temperature increase was to stay within safe limits.</p> <p>The partnership between JP Morgan and Lord’s, which began in 2011, is the largest sponsorship deal in the ground’s history. However, it is in direct conflict with the MCC’s own stance. The MCC chief executive, Guy Lavender, has talked about the club’s responsibility to “nurture the game for the next generation” as well as cricket being “at an existential risk from climate change”. The MCC’s environmental, social and governance report – Building a Sustainable Future<em> – </em>promises, among other laudable goals, to<em> “</em>work with commercial partners who have aligned sustainability goals and ambitions”.</p> <p>Lord’s is not alone in being the beneficiary of JP Morgan Chase. The group’s consumer and commercial banking arm, Chase Bank, is conspicuous at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. It was the “presenting partner” for women’s cricket, as well as cycling, the Games’ official banking partner and the official partner for Team England, Team Scotland and Team Wales. It also sponsors the British Library, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Literacy Trust and, perhaps most famously of all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/19/jp-morgan-european-super-league\">hitched its britches to football’s failed European Super League</a> in the spring of 2021, a proposal that lasted all of 48 hours <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/20/european-super-league-unravelling-as-manchester-city-and-chelsea-withdraw\">before collapsing</a> in such ignominy that the company was forced into an apology.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/31/the-crowd-goes-wild-as-sports-clubs-bring-nature-off-the-bench-aoe\">The crowd goes wild as sports clubs bring nature off the bench</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Environmental protesters have increasingly targeted sports events, sometimes particular sponsorships, sometimes to try to engage the mass audience watching on television. This year we’ve seen Just Stop Oil at the British Grand Prix, Bundesliga and in the Premier League, and Dernière Rénovation at the French Open, where a protester tied herself to a net, and at the Tour de France where organisers were forced to spray 10,000 litres of water on to the road to stop it melting in the European heatwave.</p> <p>Though no one has yet superglued themselves to the Grace Gates, the MCC are finding themselves under pressure from within. An MCC member has been handing out leaflets about JP Morgan’s sponsorship to those lining up in their egg and bacon boaters and reports useful and interesting conversations in the members queue and in the pavilion. Separately, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman of Lloyds of London and the MCC, has been approached by the environmental campaign group Mothers Rise Up in an attempt to put pressure on Lloyd’s over underwriting fossil fuel projects.</p> <p>There could soon be soft pressure from another influential quarter, as Stephen Fry takes over the MCC presidency for a year in October. Fry, who joined forces with Richard Curtis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/04/stephen-fry-joins-celebrities-urging-people-to-switch-to-green-pensions\">to encourage people to invest in green pension funds</a>, released a video in June <a href=\"https://extinctionrebellion.uk/2022/06/29/something-has-to-be-done-stephen-fry-calls-on-public-to-support-extinction-rebellion/\">calling on the public to support Extinction Rebellion</a>. “Disruption can be an awful thing.

Picking a side in industrial disputes is a distraction, says John McTernan, director of political operations under Tony Blair","byline":"John McTernan","body":"<p>There are few more ridiculous political ideas than the proposition that the Labour party should break its link with the trade unions. The union bond grounds the party and has saved Labour governments from the failed delusion of socialist economics. However, there is one idea that is far worse, and it is now gripping a small but noisy Labour faction: the idea that Labour should support every strike held in the UK.</p> <p>Whatever the cause, whatever the case, some on the left of the party believe that “your struggle is my struggle” – hence the picket-line posturing and attention-seeking social media posts of some Labour MPs this summer. This is damaging for the party. At its heart, this returning to the 1970s sends one message loud and clear: that those MPs want Labour to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/starmer-labour-must-move-from-being-party-of-protest-to-election-winner\">party of protest</a> rather than a party that is ever in power. That’s why Keir Starmer was right to ban frontbenchers from joining picket lines and absolutely correct to sack the junior shadow transport minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/sam-tarry-sacked-shadow-minister-calls-for-labour-show-solidarity-strikes\">Sam Tarry</a> after he freelanced on pay policy from an RMT picket line last week.</p> <p>Since its foundation, Labour has been a party that aspires to govern – and when it governs it does so for all of the country, not just part of it. Labour governs for young and for old, for cities and villages, for north and south, for businesses and for workers – see Lisa Nandy, who, in contrast to Tarry, carefully made her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/bt-and-openreach-strike-lisa-nandy-visits-picket-line-in-wigan\">encounter with CWU strikers</a> on Monday a chance to meet her Wigan constituents, rather than a media round.</p> <p>Strikes are disputes between workers and management, and they are resolved between them. Labour in government doesn’t pick sides in industrial disputes. Indeed, where a Labour government is the employer it has pay review machinery to make decisions independently of ministers. And where necessary – as with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/25/firefighters.society\">firefighters’ strike</a> during the Blair government – a Labour government has to face down the unions until a deal is struck.</p> <p>This should not be a controversial position – after all, the name is the Labour party not the Strike party. But it is one of the few remaining hangovers of the Corbyn era that supporting strikes is seen by a faction in the party as a shibboleth. The problem with this emotional Trotskyism is not merely that it is behaviour suited to an avowedly far-left party. More importantly, it is simply so out of touch with the modern world of work, where <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1077904/Trade_Union_Membership_UK_1995-2021_statistical_bulletin.pdf\">fewer than one in four</a> workers are in a union, far fewer have been on strike and virtually none have ever been on a picket line.</p> <p>There is a huge confusion about the historical relationship between Labour and the trade unions. When the party was founded, it was as an avowedly parliamentary party to deliver the movement’s broader aims – it was created to legislate, not to cheerlead from the sidelines of industrial dispute. Equal pay and the national minimum wage were both legislative achievements of Labour governments, not Labour oppositions. And this is the heart of the matter: there is always the moment in the life of a Labour administration where the business of governing seems too difficult – so many hard choices, so many competing demands – that being out of office again begins to appeal.</p> <p>But the truth, as great unions and their leaders have always known, is that a deal always has to be done, and that will always involve compromise. Take the rail dispute. Technological changes on the railways mean that driver-only-operation (DOO) trains safely increase capacity, and the role of booking office staff continues to change. How should these questions be resolved? That is for rail companies and workers to agree. Getting it right means the best future for the industry, its workers and its passengers. What value does an MP or minister add to this judgment? None at all. The best people to make decisions about businesses are the people who work in them – managers and workers – not politicians.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/starmer-labour-must-move-from-being-party-of-protest-to-election-winner\">Starmer: Labour must move from being ‘party of protest’ to election winner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tragedy is that this ongoing posturing is obscuring the massive and important debates around work and life that progressives should be shaping. Working from home. The “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/nov/01/the-great-resignation-almost-one-in-four-workers-planning-job-change\">great resignation</a>”. The cost of childcare. Productivity. So many critical policy debates about work: none of which have anything to do with strikes and picket lines, all of which should be shaped and guided by the Labour party and the labour movement.</p> <p>But it is in these policy discussions that the distance between politicians and the real world is most vividly seen. Almost all political thinking about employment is conducted by MPs, Labour and Tory alike, as if the public sector is the norm. Yet <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/publicsectoremployment/september2021\">five times more of us</a> work in the private sector. If businesses don’t prosper, then workers lose out.</p> <p>Of course, there is a huge prize for all workers, whether in a union or not, if there is a Labour government. The vast extension of workers’ rights under Tony Blair shows that: from guaranteed paid bank holidays and the minimum wage to maternity, paternity and adoption rights, New Labour re-regulated the labour market. But that requires Labour recovering from the worst election defeat since the 1930s in a single electoral cycle.</p> <p>Starmer has done in two years what took Neil Kinnock eight: he has made the Labour party electorally competitive again. Now Starmer needs to stick to his guns on strikes. To be an alternative government in waiting you must show you will govern for the nation, not the faction.</p> <p>• John McTernan is a political strategist and former director of political operations under Tony Blair</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/02/mens-game-boom-roadmap-womens-euro-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Men’s football boom offers roadmap and warning for women’s game | Jonathan Liew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/mens-game-boom-roadmap-womens-euro-2022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/02/mens-game-boom-roadmap-womens-euro-2022","fields":{"headline":"Men’s football boom offers roadmap and warning for women’s game","trailText":"In the glow of Euro 2022 victory, should women’s football aspire to be something similar yet very different to the men’s game?","byline":"Jonathan Liew","body":"<p>Jill Scott didn’t sleep a wink. She sauntered off the Wembley pitch, went straight into what was – by all accounts – a long and messy night of celebrations, and then simply bowled out of the team hotel on Monday morning to join the victory parade in London. Perhaps, for a stalwart midfielder who had just tasted victory in her 10th and very possibly last international tournament, she was fearful that if she slept she might eventually have to wake up.</p> <p>And for a glowing but hungover nation, there remains a certain surreal dreamlike quality to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report\" title=\"\">events at Wembley Stadium</a> on Sunday evening. The very fact of victory was startling enough: a first major international trophy for 56 years in either the men’s or the women’s game, clinched on the sweet green grass of home. The manner of victory was more startling still: a winning goal in the 110th minute against the eight-time champions Germany, a lead skilfully and cynically sequestered in the final minutes with a display of time-wasting and gamesmanship that proved beyond doubt that the English can shithouse with the very best.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/01/the-lionesses-were-astounding-in-a-tournament-that-had-the-wow-factor\">The Lionesses were astounding in a tournament that had the wow factor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For fans reared on generations of English heartache, the sight of a bold and confident national side striding to six consecutive wins (not even the men’s sides of 1966 or 2021 could boast that) was its own devastating statement.</p> <p>From Manchester to Brighton, Southampton to Sheffield, England played like the best team in the tournament because they believed they were from the very start. Unlike their predecessors under Phil Neville and Mark Sampson, they took the field with a clear plan and a united purpose.</p> <p>More satisfying still was the way they dealt with the rich variety of tests put in front of them: the technical possession football of Spain, the organised counter-press of Sweden, the physicality and speed of Germany.</p> <p>For the past two decades these have been the defining styles of European football, standards against which the English game has always been unfavourably measured. You might describe it as an inferiority complex being shed, were it not for the fact that there was no evidence such a complex existed in the first place.</p> <p>But it is the wider context that feels the least credible of all: the way this team and this tournament have gripped the nation in a manner that only Olympic Games and men’s football have managed in recent years. World Cup triumphs in rugby union and cricket have fleetingly captured the attention.</p> <p>But the rise of the Lionesses is irrefutable proof of the primacy of our national sport, a reminder that football can still touch the parts that no other sport can reach.</p> <p>It wasn’t always this way, of course. Scott knows that better than anyone.</p> <p>The journey that brought her to a sold-out Wembley on Sunday afternoon began with a substitute appearance against the Netherlands on a Thursday evening in 2006. This was the decadent heyday of the Sven-Göran Eriksson years, when the most famous women in English football were wives and girlfriends. By contrast, just under 8,000 people turned up at the Valley, which was open on only two of its four sides. The game was not televised.</p> <p>It would be another eight years until Scott got to play at Wembley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82855f7628f3c720087bbebb88dbbaa6faff9a27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82855f7628f3c720087bbebb88dbbaa6faff9a27/0_0_5104_3393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The creation of the Premier League and revenue from broadcasters such as Sky Sports transformed men’s top-flight football in the UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The creation of the Premier League and revenue from broadcasters such as Sky Sports transformed men’s top-flight football in the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Hulton Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is why it is impossible to conceive a ceiling for this England team, or indeed English women’s football in general.

You may remember what happened next.</p> <p>Those who play and watch women’s football have long since tired of unwise or fatuous comparisons with the men’s game. And yet its shadow remains inescapable, not simply as the frame of reference with which most of us grew up watching football but also as one of the primary sources of funding and potential new audiences for the women’s game. Similarly, the phenomenal boom in men’s football from the 1990s onwards offers both a road map and a warning. With growth comes attention, with attention comes revenue, and with revenue comes billionaire-ball, greed and immorality, inequality and exploitation, vultures and super-agents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>These are questions that the game is already beginning forced to grapple with, as the gulf between the biggest clubs and those further down the pyramid appears to widen and online tribalism increases with every passing season.

How far should a sport want to grow, and for what reasons? One of the main reasons the Lionesses have inspired such simple devotion this summer is that it has somehow managed to carve out its own vision of what football can be, not unconnected to the men’s game but still somehow separate and autonomous. The crowds have been young and largely gender-balanced. Fan culture has been imagined along the lines of inclusion and kindness, a safe space for young and old, people of colour, queer and non-binary people. Many of the England team are openly in same-sex relationships and nobody really cares.</p> <p>This can be – must be – the way forward. When Williamson spoke so openly of the “change in society” that could be catalysed by this triumph, she was talking about more than symbolism and WSL attendances. She was talking about the power of sport to articulate a vision of the world as we hope it one day might be: fairer, more inclusive, more tolerant, more honest, more engaged with each other as people. Perhaps this strikes you as something of a fanciful task. But nobody ever became champions of Europe by dreaming small.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/02/maisie-review-affectionate-portrait-of-britains-oldest-drag-act","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T09:00:48Z","webTitle":"Maisie review – affectionate portrait of Britain’s oldest drag act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/02/maisie-review-affectionate-portrait-of-britains-oldest-drag-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/02/maisie-review-affectionate-portrait-of-britains-oldest-drag-act","fields":{"headline":"Maisie review – affectionate portrait of Britain’s oldest drag act","trailText":"Documentary is a loving tribute to David Raven, a cabaret legend, as he continues to perform in his 80s","byline":"Cath Clarke","body":"<p>‘I should have written a bloody book. I’d have been rich.” So says David Raven, Britain’s oldest drag artiste (he hates the term “drag queen”). At 88, Raven is still performing – perched on a stool – as his alter ego Maisie Trollette. In this affectionate if slight documentary, he tells a story or two, though perhaps not enough to fill a book. Raven’s memory is fading. Nothing is said outright, but the camera lingers a few times on his medication, Donepezil, which is prescribed to help with dementia.</p> <p>So the film becomes a rather lovely portrait of Raven’s support network in Brighton – an inter-generational group of friends from the drag circuit all keeping an eye on David (“Maisie” is just for the stage). Raven is a legend on the scene. His persona is Marlene Dietrich crossed with a bouncer: bird’s nest peroxide wig and saucy Carry On humour. “He wasn’t glam, he made me laugh,” remembers a friend from the early days. No surprise he became a panto fixture.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2CfdhwEFX4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T2CfdhwEFX4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Raven reminisces about the time he was performing at the gay pub, the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, in the 80s when it got raided by police. An officer took one look at him in full drag, turned to the landlord and said: “Get your mother upstairs, she doesn’t need to see this.” Raven pulls a face of mock outrage. “Bleedin’ cheek.” More seriously he talks about nursing his partner Don, who died of Aids. Raven came of age when sex between men was illegal; you sense the secrecy and shame are still there. He won’t get dressed up at home and walk down the street in drag.</p> <p>There are some slightly stiff scenes of him meeting the world’s oldest drag queen, who flies in from America to perform with him. I preferred moments where he’s pottering about, lovingly watched over by drag scene friends Miss Jason and Dave Lynn. And his birthday party is treat. All together now: “Hip, hip, he’s gay!”</p> <p>• Maisie is released on 5 August in cinemas and on digital platforms.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"games/2022/aug/02/pressing-paws-stray-the-video-game-thats-a-hit-with-cats-and-their-humans","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T09:00:47Z","webTitle":"Pressing paws: Stray, the video game that’s a hit with cats (and their humans)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/02/pressing-paws-stray-the-video-game-thats-a-hit-with-cats-and-their-humans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2022/aug/02/pressing-paws-stray-the-video-game-thats-a-hit-with-cats-and-their-humans","fields":{"headline":"Pressing paws: Stray, the video game that’s a hit with cats (and their humans)","trailText":"Stray, a new indie title starring the internet’s favourite animal, is delighting players and pets alike, and its creators at BlueTwelve have been charmed by the reaction","byline":"Keza MacDonald","body":"<p>When a video game has us playing as an animal, it’s usually some psychedelic anthropomorphic cartoon creature such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/oct/19/crash-bandicoot-4-another-90s-video-game-icon-returns\">Crash Bandicoot</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>.

BlueTwelve Studios’ cofounders, Colas Koola and Vivien Mermet-Guyenet, who go by Koola and Viv, were fascinated by Kowloon Walled City, the mysterious, reputedly lawless and sun-staved enclave of Hong Kong that was demolished by 1994. They felt that the verticality, mystery and hidden paths of such a setting would lend themselves well to exploration as a curious feline, and so the concept for the game was born. Stray was finally announced in 2020, after arthouse publisher Annapurna Interactive picked it up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df1010dd577cf515dd6412cbb837e7cd95c7f203\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df1010dd577cf515dd6412cbb837e7cd95c7f203/0_0_4360_3113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The main inspiration … Murtaugh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The main inspiration … Murtaugh the cat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annapurna Interactive</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is obvious from all the charming details – such as the way the cat scratches on any available fabric surface – that this game was developed by cat people. Indeed, the team were inspired and comforted throughout Stray’s long development by their own cats. “One of the cofounders’ cats, Murtaugh, was the main inspiration for the hero’s visuals,” says Martin-Rage. “He was found on the streets of Montpellier and has been here since the beginning of the project. He was right under our eyes the whole time and has been a constant source of inspiration and support in his own particular way. While the protagonist is not a carbon copy, Murtaugh seems happy with the result.”</p> \n<p>There were even cats in the office with them – which occasionally meant a rather chaotic working environment. “We have two cats that work with us almost every day in the studio: Jun, who belongs to Clara the level artist, and the hairless sphynx cat Oscar, owned by Miko, the main cat animator,” Swann explains. “They are very lively additions to the team and we love them very much, even when they step on the computer power button just when we are about to save our work.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"797e70dccc0dfc9ab2f3c4309a67185ab23e557a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/797e70dccc0dfc9ab2f3c4309a67185ab23e557a/0_609_5160_3097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stray’s in-game cat says hello to a robot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charming details … Stray’s in-game cat says hello to a robot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annapurna Interactive</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>My own cat – Kim, a nine-year-old bengal cross who enjoys making mysterious noises in the middle of the night until I am compelled to come and investigate – was entirely unbothered when I was playing Stray, because she is a contrarian and would never do anything social media-worthy to please me. Watching clips of other people’s cats twitch their ears and examine the screen with a curious paw, though, has been a delight. “It was a really nice moment when we started to see the office cats react to the cat on screen,” says Martin-Rage. “It gave us a great feeling that we were going in the right direction. And when we saw that so many other players’ pets were having these strong reactions – trying to play, catch and interact with the cat on screen – we were super happy.</p> \n<p>“We hope cats enjoy Stray as much as their owners do. I have seen some messages where people said that after finishing the game, they just wanted to hug their cats, and really that’s the best reaction that we could have hoped for.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/02/jacob-rees-mogg-admits-i-was-wrong-to-say-brexit-would-not-cause-dover-delays","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T08:48:27Z","webTitle":"Jacob Rees-Mogg: I was wrong to say Brexit would not cause Dover delays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/jacob-rees-mogg-admits-i-was-wrong-to-say-brexit-would-not-cause-dover-delays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/02/jacob-rees-mogg-admits-i-was-wrong-to-say-brexit-would-not-cause-dover-delays","fields":{"headline":"Jacob Rees-Mogg: I was wrong to say Brexit would not cause Dover delays","trailText":"Minister blames France for recent problems and suggests Britons might go to Portugal instead","byline":"Lisa O'Carroll Brexit correspondent","body":"<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg has admitted he was wrong to say there would be no delays at the port of Dover caused by the UK leaving the EU.</p> \n<p>But the Brexit opportunities minister maintained the government line that the French, not Brexit, had caused the recent delays, in a radio interview on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>LBC radio replayed a claim from 2018 when he insisted “there will be no need for checks at Dover” and he was clear that “the delays will not be at Dover, they will be at Calais”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/25/kent-travel-chaos-fix-brexit-blame-dover-folkestone\">Kent travel chaos: is there a fix and should Brexit take the blame? | Explainer</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rees-Mogg blamed Paris for the “French-created delays” witnessed recently before he was asked if he would apologise for getting it wrong.</p> \n<p>“Yes, of course I got it wrong, but I got it wrong for the right reason, if I may put it that way,” he said.</p> \n<p>“The point I was making was that the only delays would be caused by the French if they decided not to allow British people to pass through freely.

Now, though the nature of his death demonstrates the US’s continuing ability to strike individual enemies even in hostile environments and raises questions about the Taliban’s relationship with extremist groups, it is unlikely to weaken al-Qaida significantly.</p> <p>Zawahiri, 71, was seriously ill and many key tasks are likely to have been handled by others for several years. One of these younger men will now take on the leadership role. Despite significant attrition in recent years of potential successors, there are several capable candidates.</p> <p>The favourite to take over is Mohammed Salah al-Din Zaidan, <a href=\"https://ctc.usma.edu/al-qaidas-soon-to-be-third-emir-a-profile-of-saif-al-adl/\">better known as Saif al Adel</a>, a 60-year-old Egyptian-born veteran of Islamic extremism who has long been considered a capable organiser by western security services. He is in Iran, however, with <a href=\"https://ctc.usma.edu/al-qaidas-soon-to-be-third-emir-a-profile-of-saif-al-adl/\">no ability to travel and his communications monitored.</a></p> <p>Others touted as possible successors include Abd al-Rahman al-Maghrebi, the director of al-Qaida’s media campaigns, Abu al-Walid al-Falastini, a senior Syria-based ideologue, and several leaders of local affiliated organisations, such as Yazid Mebrak of Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Ahmed Diriye of Al-Qaida in East Africa.</p> <p>Whoever takes over, his strategic decisions will be important. Though al-Qaida was known for its innovative empowerment of local cells, the man at the top of the hierarchy has real authority. An oath of loyalty is sworn not to the group, but to the individual.</p> <p>This is one reason Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida’s founder and leader, was able to overrule senior aides who objected to his chosen strategy of striking the “Far Enemy”, the west. If he had not, the 9/11 attacks of September 2001 in which nearly 3,000 people died could not have taken place.</p> <p>When Zawahiri became leader after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jun/19/ayman-zawahiri-observer-profile\">Bin Laden’s death in a US special forces raid in Pakistan in 2011</a>, he turned al-Qaida away from spectacular long -range attacks, believing they were counter-productive. In his last days, Bin Laden had directed meticulously planned <a href=\"https://newbooksnetwork.com/category/academic-partners/the-future-of-with-owen-bennett-jones\">ambitious strikes against oil tankers,</a> believing these would cripple the US economy. Zawahiri cancelled the plot. Instead, links with groups around the world were reinforced and efforts made to expand through gradually winning support from communities on the ground.</p> <p>This did not always bring success, and al-Qaida suffered significant setbacks in Iraq and Syria during the 11 years Zawahiri was in charge. The rise of a rival in Islamic State, which swept through these two countries and set up a new “caliphate”, led to a loss of profile and influence in a key region as well as competition elsewhere. The limited achievements of its affiliate in Yemen, once seen as a major potential threat to the region and the west, must have been a disappointment.</p> <p>But in the long run, Zawahiri’s tortoise looks set to beat the IS hare, and al-Qaida has managed to maintain or increase its presence through sub-Saharan Africa, in parts of south Asia and in other parts of the Middle East. Zawahiri’s personal decision to strengthen ties with al-Shabaab, the extremist movement in Somalia, has paid dividends with the group so secure that it now contributes millions of dollars to al-Qaida’s central treasury, according to recent intelligence reports. Zawahiri also appears to have managed relations with the various factions of the Taliban well. He died standing on the balcony of a house in the Afghan capital belonging to an aide of a hardline Taliban leader.</p> <p>But what will be the strategy of the new leader? Whoever takes over has multiple options – but no easy ones. He has to stay alive, communicate despite considerable logistic challenges, deal with regimes like the Taliban and formulate a clear idea of what his subordinates should be doing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Attempts to launch long-range attacks on the west should be practically possible, even if they might be thwarted by much improved defences.

Sampdoria are reported to have accepted an offer of around £13m for the Danish midfielder, who will move to west London if he can agree personal terms with the Bees.

Pajak is a Liverpudlian poet and his defining quality is the composure with which he encourages his readers into a false sense of security. He is a safe pair of hands writing about unsafe things. Take the opening poem, Reset. A 13-year-old girl is fiddling with a cigarette lighter – and, yes, OK, maybe it would be better if she were not smoking at her age but you, unsuspectingly, can’t help but enjoy the description of action and flame:</p> <p>She chafes a flame from the lighter,<br>listens to its gush of butane.</p> <p>The flame has a “raw egg white heat” which she sees “quiver round its yolk. Then she unthumbs / and the flame slims out.” You are halfway through the poem and it is now too late:</p> <p>She holds her breath and plugs in<br>the hot lighter. Her lips clench white,<br>eyes into walnuts, the metal cap<br>fizzing into skin and fat and this<br>is how she deletes herself.</p> <p>Pajak applies the same exactitude to this development as to the lighter’s flame – why is it that the walnuts are so good and surprising? Is it that they turn the girl into an older sufferer, eyes wrinkled in pain? Whatever the answer, the violence is mitigated by the compassion with which Pajak concludes, writing his way into a self-harmer’s saving grace:</p> <p>Then, all her muscles go slack.<br>She opens her eyes for what feels<br>like the first time. Lets out the breath<br>taken in by someone else.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A beautiful poem, Mountain Path, set out in a wavy serpentine, invites readers to think about the way a path is collectively formed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The collection includes other poems of keen imaginative empathy extended towards a tramp, a doomed cat, an almost expired collie dog, a hapless photographer who walks from Ipswich and drowns in the Orwell River, doomed cattle and battery hens (in the brilliant Brood). His elegant, unflinchingly controlled imagination is detained by victims from whom others might look away (having said that, the word “victim” would never disgrace his pen). Imagination, in Pajak’s case, involves access and his “what ifs” are in fighting form. In The Tilt, compassion is also extended lightly to himself (I assume the poem to be autobiographical) and what makes it beguiling is not only its crisp imagery but the timing of the line he casually drops two-thirds of the way through: “I was only four and couldn’t read.” And here, as elsewhere, he uses his lyric gift to deliver endings that make unifying sense, in the same way that a comic might land a great punchline.</p> <p>Not all the poems are emotionally testing or violent. A beautiful poem, Mountain Path, set out in a wavy serpentine, invites readers to think about the way a path is collectively formed – it is a meditation on sharing: “This cannot / be followed, only / learned, path. This / path that we all / pass on.” There is a fine sequence of poems about his grandmother’s death, too, beginning with the idea of a still life applied to disintegrating fruit piling up on the hospital table beside her. This conceit, gently underworked, comes off perfectly. Throughout, Pajak’s clarity is a treat – mystery exists without mystification. And I greatly enjoyed the snapshot poems such as Embers, written in March 2020 (the date’s significance needs no labouring):</p> <p>The log in the fire<br>is like a grey bellied fish,<br>its gills breathing red.</p> <p>Another flame in a collection that deserves to be a blazing success.</p> <h2><strong>The Tilt</strong></h2> <p>Those days when Mum’s hangover<br>was a dark kitchen, sat at the table,<br>head in her hands like a full bowl,</p> <p>I’d slip out of the house and come here:<br>this bookshop on Luke Street.<br>In here I could shut the world</p> <p>with a door and be walled in by hardbacks,<br>their spines full of broken capillaries.<br>Paperbacks neat as piano keys.</p> <p>In here it was quiet. Floorboards<br>tense as a frozen lake. The book<br>in my chest that opened and closed.</p> <p>And I’d kneel to a low shelf,<br>choose at random and break open<br>a loaf of paper. It didn’t matter</p> <p>that I couldn’t afford it, or that soon<br>the owner would make me leave,<br>or that I was only four and couldn’t read.</p> <p>The smell of an old book is a memory of trees.<br>A boy can tilt into it, the way a drunk<br>tilts her glass, and lean back emptied.</p> <p><em>• Slide</em> by Mark Pajak is published by Jonathan Cape (£12).

Where previously price growth was fuelled by a market brimming with confidence, today’s market is being fuelled by people’s desperation to find a home before interest rates rise further and the cost of living crisis bites deeper.”</p> <p>Nationwide and other experts expect the market to slow, however, as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, and inflation is set to reach double digits this autumn. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/16/bank-of-england-base-interest-rate-rise-mortgages-savings-annuities-house-prices-rents-effects\">Further interest rate increases from the Bank of England</a> will also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/31/era-of-soaring-house-prices-is-ending-as-central-banks-raise-rates\">cool the market</a> if they feed through to mortgage rates, with the BoE expected to announce a further rise on Thursday.</p> <p>Mortgage completions by first-time buyers have remained resilient, and are now 5% above pre-pandemic levels, even though house price growth has continued to outpace wages by a wide margin, increasing the deposit hurdle, and, together with higher interest rates, has pushed up mortgage repayments relative to incomes, Gardner said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cash transactions make up just over a third of all deals, at 35%, partly reflecting an ageing population in which more people own their homes outright.

So, sorry Beth Mead, Alessia Russo and Popp, it’s got to be Walsh. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>England have a fantastic spine to their team. Bright at centre-back and Walsh in central midfield were outstanding from start to finish. Bright did not put a foot wrong and Walsh’s pass for Toone’s goal in the final was perfect. <strong>KC</strong></p> <p>It is hard to pick one but Mead is a worthy winner of this award.

Lena Oberdorf, maybe. Walsh, perhaps. Mead probably. And Jill Scott, just because – for everything. Can it be Popp when she misses the final? Yes, it can and is. <strong>SL</strong></p> <p>Popp. Without the indefatigable forward and her goals it is doubtful if Germany would have got past Austria and France in the knockout rounds. The only shame was that, after six goals in five outstanding games, Popp injured herself in the pre-final warm-up. <strong>LT</strong></p> <p>Walsh, the anchor of England’s midfield, has turned heads but her performances have been overshadowed somewhat by the goalscorers and creators in front of her. After struggling at the World Cup in 2019 she has found her rhythm in the national team and was critical to England’s triumph. <strong>SW</strong></p> <p><strong>Goal of the tournament</strong></p> <p>It is hard to pick between three England goals: the backheel from Russo, the ice-cool scooped finish by Toone in the final and Georgia Stanway’s rocket that defeated Spain.

I know Stanway scored a pivotal, and spectacular, winner against Spain and Russo’s semi-final backheel against Sweden was very special but to pull off that lob in front of 87,000 was an immense achievement. Toone was so composed in the face of all that pressure and expectation. It was a phenomenal moment. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Russo’s goal against Sweden was great but it has to be Toone’s chip, considering it was the final.

But it’s down to this: an outrageous turn against Northern Ireland or the ludicrous backheel. Either way it’s Russo. <strong>SL</strong></p> <p>Stanway against Spain. The goalkeeper, Sandra Paños, was reduced to a state of helplessness as Stanway’s 22-yard, extra-time rocket of a shot scorched its way beyond her fingertips. Defenders should be super-wary about standing off Bayern Munich’s new signing. <strong>LT</strong></p> <p>It’s Russo’s backheel. There’s really no other contender. Yes, it was magical, but more significantly it spoke to the impact of the environment created by Wiegman, one where players feel confident, comfortable and calm enough to take risks and play with a freedom that is exhilarating. <strong>SW</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakthrough player of the tournament</strong></p> <p>Oberdorf has been around the Germany scene for some time but, at 20, would not have been a familiar name to most watchers. Her performances blended youthful energy with the intuition of a veteran; the Wolfsburg midfielder should spend the next decade among the world’s best. <strong>NA</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d9b770aa95a17ed269d78aa990df14de16630108\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9b770aa95a17ed269d78aa990df14de16630108/0_0_3878_2585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lena Oberdorf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lena Oberdorf had an excellent tournament in midfield for Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Uefa/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s got to be Russo. No one was talking about the Manchester United striker before Euro 2022 but everyone is now. That says it all. Russo’s goals, and talent, have lit up the tournament. She has proved herself a major asset. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>Oberdorf. I have known about her for a while but the German was outstanding throughout and rightly earned the young player of the tournament award. <strong>KC</strong></p> <p>Oberdorf made that Germany midfield spot her own. She was the centre through which all of the play flowed. With multiple eye-catching performances, she is definitely a huge talent to keep an eye on. <strong>SD</strong></p> <p>Russo’s talent has never been in doubt, but the question was whether she would get the minutes to prove it. Despite not starting a game, she made herself indispensable with two of the best goals of the tournament. <strong>JL</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a0b52a115056a582e68beb6755403e679b6f45b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a0b52a115056a582e68beb6755403e679b6f45b/0_0_4287_2858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alessia Russo plays for England against Spain at Euro 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alessia Russo has been England’s go-to substitute and did not disappoint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oberdorf can’t be that young, can she? But in terms of a breakthrough star, a sense of excitement, an idol emerging, it has to be Russo. The fans’ response to her simply warming up spoke volumes. <strong>SL</strong></p> <p>Oberdorf. Is she really only 20? Germany’s holding midfielder represents a very big reason why her country are so good in transition. An expert at breaking up play, ball recovery, slowing games down and controlling the tempo, Oberdorf knows precisely when to concede fouls. She ensured England’s Fran Kirby did not exert quite the influence she would have wanted in the final. <strong>LT</strong></p> <p>When Wiegman started in September, Stanway said she was out of favour. It wasn’t until the opening game of the Euros she knew a spot in the midfield would be hers to lose. All eyes were on Lauren Hemp, who has performed well, but it has been the physical and battling Stanway who stepped up a gear. <strong>SW</strong></p> <p><strong>Personal highlight</strong></p> <p>The atmosphere inside Wembley at the final: noisy, partisan, edgy, ultimately delirious, but none of the menace we have seen at other events. Being able to sneak into Iceland v Belgium, a game I was not covering, straight after an Erling Haaland press conference across the Etihad Bridge was a pleasant bonus. <strong>NA</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f8d5e7b26f3c842cb3869933e3db0ce74ab0ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f8d5e7b26f3c842cb3869933e3db0ce74ab0ca0/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A delirious Wembley crowd during the Euro 2022 final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A delirious Wembley crowd during the final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meeting the BBC commentator Jonathan Pearce and sitting alongside him in the hot-seat doing co-commentary at the final. Jonathan has followed women’s football for such a long time, since the days when it was unfashionable and he is really invested in the game. He told me he was close to tears after Phil Neville had recalled me to the England team for the SheBelieves Cup in the US in 2018 and I ruptured my ACL against France. That meant a lot. Having played in the 2009 final, doing co-comms felt like I’d come full circle. <strong>AA</strong></p> <p>England winning. We have waited many years – players and fans – for a moment such as this and it was incredible to celebrate England winning a major tournament on home soil in front 87,000 and millions watching at home. <strong>KC</strong></p> <p>Having travelled home and abroad covering the Lionesses for the past decade, the whole tournament was a thoroughly emotional and rewarding experience.

As they’ve got better and as the game has grown, the opportunities for women’s football journalists have opened up. To see these players reach a final, something that will elevate our industry as well as themselves and women’s football, has been special. That, and interacting regularly with the incredibly likable Wiegman. <strong>SW</strong></p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>A generally well-run tournament was rewarded with in-depth coverage but it could have been even better: for some of the knockout games Uefa appeared to have underestimated the sheer volume of media attention and it meant some pieces had to be written from sofa rather than stadium. More could have been accommodated without denying fans space; perhaps it can be used as a pleasant lesson that interest is sky high. <strong>NA</strong></p> <p>The serious knee injuries that deprived Spain of Alexia Putellas and Jennifer Hermoso before the tournament and France of Marie-Antoinette Katoto during the group game against Belgium. I was also disappointed for Popp that her injury in the warm-up meant she missed the final. That quartet would have offered the tournament – and the final – real added stardust. <strong>AA</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0a8bae5591b8286920f3a0cb57238169a57b3501\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a8bae5591b8286920f3a0cb57238169a57b3501/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexia Putellas after suffering her ACL injury.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Injury robbed the tournament of Europe’s best player in Alexia Putellas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tournament surpassed all of my expectations. It was outstanding. <strong>KC</strong></p> <p>I came into this tournament with a lot of interest around Italy. Their performances at the World Cup in 2019 and the growth of the domestic league seemed to illustrate that things were heading in the right direction. To not emerge from the group stage was a massive disappointment. <strong>SD</strong></p> <p>The injury that ruled out Putellas days before the start. The entire tournament could have looked different with her presence. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p>Popp: there in the team picture, no longer there at kick-off. Just so cruel. <strong>SL</strong></p> <p>The lack of ambition over some of the grounds used and the absence of any venues north of the M62 corridor. Brighton’s Amex Stadium and Sheffield United’s Bramall Lane were too small for England’s quarter- and semi-finals respectively and the north-east was overlooked. The organisers missed a trick in not using Newcastle’s St James’ Park and Sunderland’s Stadium of Light. <strong>LT</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"387f0c9ec9d520d35172f1127cde9ea5c341243f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/387f0c9ec9d520d35172f1127cde9ea5c341243f/0_0_4336_2891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City’s Academy Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venues such as Manchester City’s Academy Stadium were, in hindsight, much too small.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have a few “what ifs”. England could have sold out Wembley six times over. I’m not saying they necessarily should have played all their games there, but grounds of 30,000-35,000 denied so many the chance to experience, as my dad put it after the Northern Ireland game, “one of the best football match atmospheres I’ve ever experienced”. <strong>SW</strong></p> <p><strong>What now</strong><strong> for women’s football in England</strong><strong>?</strong></p> <p>As usual, the word legacy will be worn out over the coming weeks and it is vital the game, and pathway within it, become easily accessible to the millions of youngsters who will have watched recent weeks in awe. The strength of the domestic product beneath the top teams, who play to a thrilling level, needs to improve too. Mobility between the divisions is not what it should be and means some of the more progressive setups hit a brick wall before they can have a crack at the top two tiers. <strong>NA</strong></p> <p>It’s all about turning words into actions. The men’s parent clubs of WSL sides, and their media teams especially, need to do more to drive the women’s game forward and make people aware of when and where matches are happening. A new collective mindset is needed to make the game more inclusive and diverse. It’s an opportunity that can’t be wasted. <strong>AA</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f42ee3ea3b59d077de5cec7aa5d73b12a2d2d07d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f42ee3ea3b59d077de5cec7aa5d73b12a2d2d07d/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Increased interest and stadium capacity should help the WSL next season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Increased interest and stadium capacity should help the WSL next season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The momentum can not stop. We need Lionesses games to be sold out every time, we need WSL attendances to increase and equal opportunities for girls to play at school. <strong>KC</strong></p> <p>We all have a responsibility to make sure we capitalise on this historic moment. That means girls and women having access to play football at all levels. But also as the media, we need to continue our coverage, putting the sport in front of people’s eyes. We can’t let our foot off the gas now. <strong>SD</strong></p> <p>Cautious optimism. The interest is there; the real question is whether infrastructure and grassroots investment can keep pace. <strong>JL</strong></p> <p>Fingers crossed that more girls will be able to play in school; WSL crowds will increase as more games are played at established Premier League grounds and, particularly with the Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand beckoning, media coverage will be amplified and expanded. <strong>LT</strong></p> <p>Thirty years of hurt, presumably. More seriously: at this level, Wiegman’s side has only just got started so the World Cup could be fun; beyond that, Leah Williamson’s post-final call to arms says it well. <strong>SL</strong></p> <p>Please, please let this energy and enthusiasm not dissipate. Chelsea and Liverpool are the latest teams to have announced games at their main grounds come the new WSL season. Arsenal have committed to six games at the Emirates in the season. There is a chance for people to take their passion for this tournament and the journey of the players into the domestic game. But fans should also go even more local. There are some fantastic Championship and national league sides that provide affordable football and great atmospheres. <strong>SW</strong></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/02/the-last-son-review-outlaw-has-to-kill-or-be-killed-by-his-own-kids-in-gothic-western","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T07:00:46Z","webTitle":"The Last Son review – outlaw has to kill or be killed by his own kids in gothic western","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/02/the-last-son-review-outlaw-has-to-kill-or-be-killed-by-his-own-kids-in-gothic-western","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/02/the-last-son-review-outlaw-has-to-kill-or-be-killed-by-his-own-kids-in-gothic-western","fields":{"headline":"The Last Son review – outlaw has to kill or be killed by his own kids in gothic western","trailText":"Sam Worthington plays a bad dude in this beautifully scored, authentically unhygienic drama","byline":"Leslie Felperin","body":"<p>Somewhere in the wild west, sometime after the civil war, legendary outlaw Isaac LeMay (Sam Worthington) decides to take his fate into his own hands and circumvent a prophecy that he can only be killed by one of his own children. That means tracking down his many offspring and slaying them first, one by one. A man of very few words but blessed with an inordinate abundance of hair and uncanny luck when it comes to avoiding bullets, LeMay has a few talents, but not a lot of charm. Also, he’s clearly never read any fairy tales of Greek tragedies otherwise he’d know that an ironic twist lies directly in his path in the last act, one that most viewers will see coming from miles across the prairies and hilly terrain.</p> <p>Meanwhile, LeMay is himself being tracked by various unaligned bounty hunters and folks with a grudge or cause, such as gun-and-tracker-for-hire Solomon (Thomas Jane), a former Union soldier who was raised by Native Americans, Cal (Colson Baker, AKA rapper Machine Gun Kelly) a son of LeMay who’s taken up the family trade of outlawing even though he never met his Pa. (In a couple of on-the-nose scenes the latter gets to operate an actual machine gun.)

Take Jim Adkins. His band, Jimmy Eat World, are nearing 30 years together and the emo godfathers are still touring relentlessly. But Adkins, 46, only conceded that his band might be a going concern around a decade ago – “I thought: ‘Huh, I guess this is what I do’” – and remains dubious about their long-term prospects. “I still don’t take this seriously as what I’m going to do in my life,” he says.</p> <p>That scepticism may have something to do with Jimmy Eat World’s strange trajectory, which saw the Mesa, Arizona band whisked from the DIY emo scene of the mid-90s, where they’d be playing in “the craziest of places” – basements, friends’ houses, the back rooms of churches – and on to major label Capitol, a place where, in Adkins’s words, they had “no business being”. He remembers visiting Capitol’s New York offices – “back when labels had actual buildings in really expensive cities” – and being greeted with giant double-door-sized posters for P, a short-lived alt-rock band fronted by Johnny Depp, the sort of superstar Capitol were more accustomed to dealing with. Adkins mimics the baffled faces of the employees. “They were like: “Err, can we help you guys?’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I mean it was just silly<em>,” </em>Adkins recalls, speaking from the somewhat less plush setting of the backstage area at London’s Brixton Academy. “It was just hilarious that we were crashing that party.”</p> <p>Jimmy Eat World wouldn’t last long at the party, releasing two low-selling albums – including their 1999 classic Clarity, now regarded as something of a set text of the emo genre – before being dropped. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oKsxPW6i3pM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>No sooner had they left the major label than they delivered an album that was major-label massive. Bleed American (temporarily retitled Jimmy Eat World after the 11 September attacks), in 2001, took their twinkling, lovelorn sound from Clarity and reinforced it with powerpop hooks. The album’s second single, The Middle, a propulsive pep talk encouraging the band to carry on following their label woes (“Hey, don’t write yourself off yet … ”), would become their biggest hit, a US radio mainstay that even Prince and Taylor Swift saw fit to cover.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Emo?

Emotional hardcore, as it was initially termed, had been quietly growing since the mid-80s, but by the early 00s it had become an actual scene, attracting label interest, big crowds and press attention. It didn’t seem to matter that the media roped together bands who shared little in common: no one could really mistake Jimmy Eat World’s heartfelt sound with the tortured histrionics of, say, My Chemical Romance.</p> <p>Naturally, says Adkins, the band were resistant to the emo tag: “We worked too hard to be branded part of a trend, because when that’s not cool any more, you’re not either. We didn’t want to end up in that Valhalla.” But in the years since they’ve learned to make their peace with it. “I get it. You need to call this world of ‘young person’s rock bands’ something,” Adkins says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93756034ebcd27893e4d330fd5a85389d611e945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93756034ebcd27893e4d330fd5a85389d611e945/0_639_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Eat World, photographed backstage at the O2 Academy Brixton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It’s been emotional … Jimmy Eat World, photographed backstage at the O2 Academy Brixton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, those young persons aren’t so young any more. Emo may even be entering its nostalgia phase: later this year Jimmy Eat World will be appearing on the bill at the aptly named <a href=\"https://www.whenwewereyoungfestival.com/\" title=\"\">When We Were Young</a>, a Las Vegas festival bringing together just about every notable emo act of the past two decades. (The fact that the event features acts as polar-opposite as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/31/avril-lavigne-let-go-turns-20-interview\" title=\"\">Avril Lavigne</a> and throat-shredding post-hardcore band Glassjaw indicates just how nebulous the term is.) The festival had to add two extra dates due to demand, and has now sold out entirely, suggesting there’s a buoyant market for getting the over-30s to revisit their angsty adolescence.</p> <p>Still, it has all stirred warm memories in Adkins, reminding him of Jimmy Eat World’s early days, when they found themselves on endless touring cycles of the States with scrappy, like-minded bands such as the Get Up Kids. “None of it was cool, and none of it was financially a winner, to say the least.” Those toilet-circuit reminiscences inspired recent single Something Loud, arguably Jimmy Eat World’s best track in years. Musically it’s riffy and euphoric, but lyrically there’s something more complex going on, with Adkins both toasting the band’s formative years, and also recognising the importance of leaving them behind. (“Friends at the show in 95, miss every one of them / But there’s a moment that you die or you move on to live.”)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There’s still a part of all of us that identifies as the 19-year-old kid showing up to who knows what kind of gig</p> <footer> <cite>Jim Adkins</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Something Loud speaks to a wider shift in Adkins’s songwriting. His lyrics used to be preoccupied with the teenage thrill of chasing something indeterminate, of leaping into the unknown. Now, though, he feels that that way of thinking is bound up with some more toxic traits: he stopped drinking at 36 after seeking treatment for alcohol abuse, and sees parallels in the way that both revolve round a never-ending search for something more.</p> <p>“I think I have a healthier relationship with that [way of thinking] now,” he says. “There’s definitely a part of that that’s still around, the addict/alcoholic mindset: ‘I have to be somewhere else, with someone else doing anything else right now.’ That constant feeling of being unsatisfied with what you’ve just achieved, spending a lot of energy on the wrong target … I was living in that as a person, and now I’m more fascinated by it as an observer. As much work as you do on yourself, it’s still there, just at a lower volume, and I don’t have to listen to it.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOWnhMxJMMk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VOWnhMxJMMk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>They may be older, wiser and healthier, but Adkins and Jimmy Eat World are still possessed by the same energy they had in their early days.

Not after Sunday. After all sorts of attendance records tumbled and 87,000 turned up at Wembley to see England crowned European champions we have finally reached the point so many players, coaches and administrators have worked so hard to achieve for so many years.</p> <p>I was overjoyed on Sunday but I also found the experience of being at Wembley surreal. I played in the 2009 final in Finland when England lost 6-2 against Germany and the difference between then and now is like night and day. Back then my England teammates and I routinely got told to “get back in the kitchen” when we returned from tournaments and, in truth, the 2009 final was so low key it didn’t feel that much different to any other match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/01/the-lionesses-were-astounding-in-a-tournament-that-had-the-wow-factor\">The Lionesses were astounding in a tournament that had the wow factor | Karen Carney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were only about four journalists from England out in Helsinki so, during my work for the BBC at Euro 2022 it’s been incredible to see packed press boxes. That sea change explains why I felt emotional watching my former fellow Lioness Jill Scott come on as a substitute in the final on Sunday. At 35 Jill, who also played in the 2009 final, connects that era to the present day and has been a shining light for women’s football. Jill’s superpower is supreme emotional intelligence and she embodies the sense of responsibility for developing the women’s game shared by all England players, past and present.</p> <p>It’s a powerful collective mindset but we should remember Hope Powell’s trailblazing role in forging it. The Lionesses’ manager back in 2009, Hope, who in many ways was way ahead of her time, spent years fighting to improve the lot of women players in England and did so much to lay the foundations and create the structure which enabled Sarina Wiegman’s team to win Euro 2022.</p> <p>Hope, remember, was working in a society which did not always readily support and respect women, let alone female footballers. Since then changing attitudes and the Me Too movement have helped to shift the narrative but England’s impressive captain, Leah Williamson, was right to say that she hoped the tournament’s success could help to increase wider gender equality. She knows she’s on a big stage now and is embracing the possibilities that platform creates for women in all sorts of roles. Leah recognises the ability of women’s football to have an impact on society and typifies the way England players of different generations stand shoulder to shoulder in understanding they can use their platform to improve things for future generations.</p> <p>Back in 2009 the English women’s game was still some way from turning professional. That part-time status explains why I spent a sizeable portion of my playing career with clubs in Sweden and the US. My American experience, especially, proved a personal watershed. It opened my eyes to the reality that, in the English game, we were so grateful for getting the bare minimum and were so used to begging for the most basic things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c63d2ea23c5d1d8d163fa76595eeb557fd0fb718\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c63d2ea23c5d1d8d163fa76595eeb557fd0fb718/0_118_3636_2180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The England coach Hope Powell, with Alex Scott, after losing the Euro 2009 final against Germany – but Powell should be celebrated as a trailblazer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The England coach Hope Powell, with Alex Scott, after losing the Euro 2009 final against Germany – but Powell should be celebrated as a trailblazer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women footballers in America have long been willing to shout and scream for recognition, to take collective action to fight for the right to equal pay. Living in the US I learned how important it was to have a voice and use it in order to keep striving for progress. That can take a lot of energy so it explains why so many people felt so proud when England finally lifted that trophy.</p> <p>Tony Leighton should be among them. The retired journalist, until recently a regular contributor to the Guardian, has done so much for women’s football in England. He was covering the game when virtually no one else was and, crucially, had the journalistic skill to not merely tell our stories but bring them to life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony recognised the quality and potential of the women’s game when it felt like the rest of the world wasn’t ready for it. He challenged norms and was relentless in pushing editors to offer the space needed to cover it. Female players of my generation have a lot for which to thank him.</p> <p>Back in 2009 English players had the ability but lacked the exposure to regular, highly competitive games necessary to acquire vital experience of in‑game management and understanding of wider tactical nuance. At that time Germany and the US were so far ahead of everyone else that it is no surprise that the former won eight European championships between 1989 and 2013.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2022/aug/01/fans-celebrate-england-womens-euro-triumph-london-in-pictures\">Fans celebrate England women’s Euro triumph in London – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now that not merely England but teams across the rest of the world have caught up, the resultant parity between nations means it is almost impossible to imagine one team being so dominant for so long again in future European Championship and World Cup tournaments. Indeed the lineup for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next summer is so strong, and the technical standard so high, that several teams will believe they can win it.</p> <p>Such intense competition should help to maximise the game’s commercial development, with battles for, among other things, television rights in turn providing the finance needed to help domestic clubs to achieve the degree of inclusivity and diversity English women’s football still desperately requires.

Here’s a look at the 10 most important figures heading into the 2022 NFL season","byline":"Oliver Connolly","body":"<p>The pads are thudding. The sprinklers are sprinkling. Training camp is here. And with that, we look at the 10 most important figures for the 2022 NFL season, in no particular order.</p> <h2><strong>1) Trey Lance, quarterback, San Francisco 49ers</strong></h2> <p>It’s Lance Time in San Francisco. Everybody loves the idea of a young quarterback watching and learning the game from the sideline, taking his time, cultivating his craft away from the spotlight and pressure. But, at some point, it’s go time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/27/bomani-jones-to-mina-kimes-ranking-the-nfls-best-analysts\">Bomani Jones to Mina Kimes: ranking the NFL’s best analysts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Niners are embracing the uncertainty. Lance was drafted to <a href=\"https://readoptional.substack.com/p/trey-lance-analysis-nfl\">solve a specific schematic riddle</a> that Jimmy Garoppolo could not. Garoppolo was part of a team that came within a drive of the Super Bowl and returned to an NFC championship game. But his flaws were consistently exposed. Lance might not be as consistent as Garoppolo, but he raises the team’s ceiling.</p> <p>No team in the league has as wide a range of outcomes as the Niners in 2022. Sat here at the start of August, you could convince yourself that they will win it all, thanks to the blend of Kyle Shanahan’s re-worked offense, a stacked defensive line, a re-shaped secondary and Lance. It’s just as conceivable that they win six games: That Lance isn’t ready; that the defensive line regresses to the mean. The most decisive factor between the two: the new starting quarterback.</p> <h2><strong>2) Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner</strong></h2> <p>Two crucial things weigh over Goodell heading into the season. He will serve as the appealer-in-Chief for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/deshaun-watson-suspension-cleveland-browns-quarterback\">Deshaun Watson’s impending appeal</a>. Nestled in the fine print of the latest CBA is the ability for the commissioner, or his designee, to appeal any decision from the league’s newly-appointed disciplinary officer, who handed down a six-game suspension on Monday.</p> <p>Then there’s the small matter of Daniel Snyder and the Washington Commanders. Snyder, the league’s most cartoonishly villainous owner, continues to drag the Washington franchise and the league into a swamp of his own making. Snyder finally answered questions under oath last Thursday to the House oversight committee. The congressional committee continues to <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/commanders/2022/07/28/daniel-snyder-testifies-before-congress-under-oath/10171530002/\">probe the Washington franchise</a> and accusations that Snyder presided over a toxic workplace culture.</p> <p>Other owners are <a href=\"https://www.insidehook.com/daily_brief/sports/nfl-owners-votes-removal-dan-snyder\">reported to be fed up</a> with Snyder’s act, enough perhaps to force him out of the league. Snyder is notoriously litigious, which has worked as a shield for him and the franchise throughout his sleaze-riddled run. But as the accusations mount – including that he <a href=\"https://www.sportingnews.com/uk/nfl/news/commanders-congress-allegations-unlawful-conduct-dan-snyder/au7bdi0g40xrbsbsnqhjurr2\">presented a set of phony books to his league partners </a>– Goodell could be forced into taking action to try to remove the owner.</p> <h2><strong>3) Patrick Mahomes, quarterback, Kansas City Chiefs</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/afc-championship-game-chiefs-bengals-nfl-football-joe-burrow\">second-half meltdown</a> in the AFC championship game cost the Chiefs a shot at a second title last season. Now there’s a new look in Kansas City: Tyreek Hill and Tyrann Mathieu, stalwarts of the team’s recent success, are out. Hill was a once-in-a-lifetime field tilter that made life easier for his quarterback and the pass-catchers beside him. He imbued the whole offense with a sense that there was no deficit that was insurmountable.</p> <p>Mahomes will have to strike up an instant connection with his new supporting cast to lead another postseason push. He has lived a blessed life early in his career – the ideal coach, franchise and supporting cast. The Chiefs’ roster remains one of the most talented in the league, but it’s now over Mahomes to raise the level of those around him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49b28dd03746421da9fba4318e4b9337fe8c7837\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49b28dd03746421da9fba4318e4b9337fe8c7837/0_0_4392_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Mahomes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Mahomes walks down to the field during Kansas City Chiefs training camp at Missouri Western State University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denny Medley/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4) Sean McVay, head coach, LA Rams</strong></h2> <p>McVay is looking to become the first head coach to lead a team to back-to-back Super Bowl titles since Bill Belichick in 2003-04. He’s also set to become the highest paid coach in the league, with reports suggesting his new contract will eclipse Belichick’s.</p> <p>Yet while the Rams are looking to tie McVay down for the long-term, whispers continue to persist that McVay would be happy to step away from the Rams – be it for another job or TV work – once the cap sins of the past few years start to catch up to the team.</p> <h2><strong>5) Dr Alex Steinforth, NFL Germany</strong></h2> <p>The NFL has entered a new phase of its international expansion. Whereas before there was a heavy focus on London (with nods to games in Canada and Mexico), the league is now going global. The NFL awarded Exclusive International Home Market Areas to 18 teams across 26 markets in eight countries. As the NFL takes its streaming rights under its own umbrella, they’re focusing on securing as many eyes on games as possible, irrespective of the location. Eyeballs are eyeballs; dollars are dollars.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/22/nfl-turnaround-rankings-which-2021-also-rans-will-make-the-playoffs-this-season\">NFL turnaround rankings: which 2021 also-rans will make the playoffs this season?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The next key frontier: Germany. For the first time, the NFL is taking a regular season game to Munich. More than three million people entered the queue to secure tickets to the Bucs-Seahawks game in November. The demand for tickets to the inaugural game will inevitably lead to a second game in 2023 with the prospect of future games in different German markets – Frankfurt, Düsseldorf – in future years.</p> <h2><strong>6) Aaron Rodgers, quarterback, Green Bay Packers</strong></h2> <p>The Packers were finally able to put an end to the will-he-won’t-he Aaron Rodgers saga over the offseason. Rodgers signed an enormous three-year, $151m deal. Does that mean that Rodgers will play all three years? Who knows? Does it mean he’s happy? Pffft.</p> <p>What we do know: Rodgers’ new deal made it tough for the Packers to improve over the offseason. The team was able to find enough cash behind the sofa to keep the bulk of its core intact. But the cap crunch meant that Green Bay had to say goodbye to valuable contributors. The biggest loss: Davante Adams, a one-man offense masquerading as a receiver.</p> <p>The Packers are still one of the most talented teams in the NFL, but it’s hard to point to more than one area where they decidedly improved this offseason. Rodgers is still at the peak of his powers, gunning for a third straight MVP award, but it’s been proven that he cannot carry a team to a championship alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ac607ccea2aff23a84310396754e1de55e5e639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ac607ccea2aff23a84310396754e1de55e5e639/0_0_3250_2215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Rodgers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Rodgers, left, hands off the ball during training camp at Ray Nitschke Field in Green Bay, Wisconsis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Powers/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7) Jerry Jones, owner, Dallas Cowboys</strong></h2> <p>Jones has already been talking about the warmth of the seat of his head coach. Mike McCarthy is not in any trouble, he says. But Jones <em>does </em>have options, he’d like to note. Jones will help determine whether or not the Cowboys can make a serious championship push – something that could mean making an in-season change from McCarthy to one of his ready-to-go coordinators.</p> <p>As one of the power-centers of the league, Jones will also be heavily involved in any decision as it relates to Daniel Snyder’s ownership of the Commanders and approving the Walton family’s takeover of the Broncos.</p> <h2><strong>8) Josh McDaniels, head coach, Las Vegas Raiders</strong></h2> <p>Drop the Raiders into any other division in the NFL and they’d be a surefire contender. More often than not, they’d be the preseason favorite. Plop them in the AFC West, however, and you’re looking at a team that could conceivably finish first or last.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/18/dallas-cowboys-valuation-losers-scandal\">The world’s most valuable sports team hasn’t won a thing in decades. How?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his second go-round as a head coach, McDaniels has walked into a team with perhaps the finest skill position group anywhere in football. In Adams, he has the game’s top receiver. In Darren Waller, he has one of the upper-tier tight ends. In Hunter Renfrow, the duo has an overqualified third banana. Locking in <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/33729753/derek-carr-agrees-3-year-1215-million-extension-las-vegas-raiders-source-confirms\">Derek Carr into a new contract</a> gives the Raiders assurance at quarterback – and with a quarterback who continues to improve.</p> <p>The Raiders <em>should </em>be good. The other AFC West teams look more complete. McDaniels and co. will likely be forced to play the role of spoilers: halting the Chargers’ momentum; making life uncomfortable for Mahomes and the Chiefs; knee-capping the start of the Walton-Wilson-Hackett era in Denver.</p> <h2><strong>9) Ken Dorsey, offensive coordinator, Buffalo Bills</strong></h2> <p>The Bills have no obvious flaw. They have the deepest and most talented roster in the NFL. They have an elite quarterback. They have playmakers all over the field. They have a good offensive line. Their defensive front is loaded. Their secondary features the best safety tandem in the league. They are deep at corner. The only plausible cause for concern: Moving from Brian Daboll as offensive coordinator to Ken Dorsey. Daboll ran a specific system with Allen. And while Dorsey will likely look to replicate that success, it’s possible (though unlikely) that there could be some teething problems.</p> <h2><strong>10) Tom Brady, quarterback, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></h2> <p>Brady’s retirement-unretirement was the dominant story of the offseason. One<a href=\"https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/tom-brady-announced-nfl-retirement-u-turn-after-visiting-man-utd\"> trip to Salford</a>, and Brady decided he wasn’t quite ready to give up on this whole football thing after all. Whether or not <em>this </em>is his final season, before he takes up a lucrative job with FOX, remains to be seen. He is still at the apex of his powers, even at 44 years old. At this point, another MVP-caliber season is more of an expectation than a projection. And with reinforcements along the offense – on the line and at the skill positions – the Bucs enter the year as neck-a-neck favorites with the Rams to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/02/lionesses-won-women-football","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"When the Lionesses won, every overlooked and patronised woman triumphed too | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/02/lionesses-won-women-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/02/lionesses-won-women-football","fields":{"headline":"When the Lionesses won, every overlooked and patronised woman triumphed too","trailText":"So many women who couldn’t care less about football were in tears, because they understood what it meant, says Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff","byline":"Gaby Hinsliff","body":"<p>If you want a job doing, ask a woman.</p> <p>So the former sports minister (and girls’ football coach) Tracey Crouch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tracey_crouch/status/1553812417921970178\">tweeted</a>, tongue firmly in cheek, as the whistle blew at Wembley on Sunday. All those years of waiting, wanting and arguing over why football wasn’t coming home, and it turns out the nation was looking in the wrong place all the time. It wasn’t England men’s squad who would end the years of hurt, but the women’s, beating Germany in a tense and thrilling final watched by a record-breaking crowd at Wembley and millions more at home. The nail-biting finish was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/england-victory-in-womens-euro-2022-final-draws-record-tv-audience-of-17m\">most-watched</a> five minutes of television this year, and left barely a dry eye in the house. Never again can broadcasters deny women’s sport airtime with the feeble excuse that nobody wants to watch it.</p> <p>The exuberant, joyful and ferociously determined Lionesses have busted through every barrier facing them, and in the process they did so much more than bring a trophy home. The message that football is for everyone, boy or girl, will resonate wherever jumpers are put down for goalposts. So too will the idea that women can be powerful, strong and fiercely competitive without being branded bitches; that wanting to be an alpha female at the top of your game is something to be celebrated, not crushed out of girls at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>What’s more, they did it without the ugliness that has sometimes marred the men’s game. No crowd violence, abuse screamed from the stands or booing of Germany’s anthem. Parents taking their thrilled small daughters to the match didn’t have to pick their way past anyone trying to insert a lit firework into any part of their anatomy. And even more miraculously, somehow the Lionesses managed not to exclude the boys. My son and his friends have followed this contest as keenly as any other: having grown up with girls playing on their village teams, to this generation football is finally just football, and winning is winning. Besides, what’s not to love about a squad gleefully <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/sarina-wiegman-press-conference-england-wembley-b2135407.html\">interrupting their manager’s post-match press conference</a>, singing and dancing on the table? There is a glorious unselfconsciousness to the Lionesses, which is perhaps the only good thing to come of not labouring under the same crippling weight of national expectations as Gareth Southgate’s lot.</p> <p>Yet watching them, you could weep for all the female players lost to the game at every stage from the playground upwards, during the long years of being denied a level playing field with the men. It’s not just the waste of talent, but the sheer joy denied; the lives that could have been lived, and weren’t. And that’s a story that resonates far beyond sport.</p> <p>Why were so many women who normally couldn’t care less about football in tears watching the Lionesses triumph? Because we understood, or thought we did, what it must have meant to them at a gut level. Because a lot of us know how it feels to have been underestimated and overlooked, patronised and pushed out or made to feel unwanted; because some of us know too the bittersweet pleasure of succeeding in fields where older women were prevented from doing so. Because we’ve heard the feeble excuses about why our bosses would love to pay us what our male colleagues are getting, but for some incomprehensible structural reason can’t. Because we’ve all seen mediocre men failing upwards, while competent but less noisily self-promoting women don’t get the same chances. The sight of England’s women quietly nailing what the men have been trying and failing to do for so long, on a fraction of the money and with virtually none of the drama, evokes a rare and very specific kind of satisfaction.</p> <p>So it was a smart piece of image-making for Liz Truss – who, after years of being mocked and memed and not taken seriously, now threatens to leapfrog all her rivals into No 10 – to join the crowds at Wembley. Victory for Truss would be – how to put this politely? – a rather more divisive prospect for the nation than victory for Leah Williamson and her squad.</p> <p>Truss was not the strongest candidate in the field. But she has been the quickest to analyse and learn from her weaknesses over the past few weeks, the most fleet-footed player of internal party politics, and above all the one who clearly wants it most. Having made Sunak look complacent by comparison, she is now visibly enjoying the last laugh over those who underestimated her. Don’t be surprised if the Lionesses’ triumph finds its way into her campaign speeches.</p> <p>Yet beware attempts, however uplifting or well-meaning, to paint this victory as a can-do signal that young girls can be anything if they work hard enough. For the more complex message of the Lionesses’ success is that individual hard work by itself isn’t always enough; that progress requires dismantling the structural barriers holding women back.</p> <p>What happened on Sunday reflects not just individual brilliance on the field, but years of hard slog behind the scenes by sports administrators, coaches, players and champions of women’s football from the grassroots to the top, doing the unglamorous work of building a talent pipeline, an audience and a secure funding base for women’s football.</p> <p>The Lionesses themselves know full well that they stand on the shoulders of those who went before them, including former England players forced to fit training around their day jobs because they couldn’t afford to go professional.</p> <p>When Chloe Kelly celebrated her winning goal on Sunday by whipping off her shirt and racing gleefully around the field in her sports bra, it was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/sports-bra-photo-england-womens-euros-win-chloe-kelly-goal-celebration\">thrillingly unfettered moment of glee</a>; a rare instance of a woman’s body evoking athletic skill and power, not pliant, pouting sexiness. But it was also a conscious homage to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/07/05/brandi-chastains-sports-bra-changed-womens-soccer-womens-history-years-ago/\">American player Brandi Chastain</a>, who was criticised for doing the same thing in the 1999 World Cup.

It is estimated that at least 77,579 hippo parts and products were legally traded from 2009 to 2018.</p> <p>In 2016, hippos were classified as vulnerable to extinction on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/iucn-red-list\">IUCN red list</a> with local declines, particularly in west Africa, raising fears about the survival of the species in some of the 38 African countries where it is found.</p> <p>The hippopotamus is one of the world’s heaviest land animals; males can weigh as much as 1,800kg, and they are often found in large groups. The animals are especially vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long gestation periods of eight months, and females not reaching sexual maturity until nine or 10 years.</p> <p>Rebecca Lewison, co-chair of the IUCN SSC hippo specialist group, said hippos have been overlooked as a species of conservation concern due to their high population densities, which can give the impression that there are plenty of them in the wild. But populations have declined substantially over the last 20 years.</p> <p>“The biggest threat to hippos is habitat loss and degradation. Common hippos rely on fresh water to survive, and that often puts them in conflict with local communities who also need fresh water for agriculture, energy, fishing and residential development,” she said.</p> <p>“Hippo-human conflicts are on the rise, particularly in west Africa, where common hippo populations are declining rapidly. Hippo-human conflicts unfortunately result in both hippo and human fatalities and have contributed to a related problem of unregulated hunting for hippo meat and ivory, which is found in their canine teeth,” she added.</p> <p>The proposals are unlikely to affect a small population of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2021/dec/06/how-pablo-escobars-cocaine-hippos-became-a-biodiversity-nightmare\">hippos found in Colombia</a>, which has grown from the private collection of drug lord Pablo Escobar. Many ecologists say these are an invasive species and should be culled.</p> <p>Following the proposal, the Cites secretariat will provide an assessment to see whether hippos meet the appendix I criteria and produce a recommendation based on expert evidence.</p> <p>Keenan Stears, a University of California Santa Barbara ecologist who is based part of the year in Kruger national park, South Africa, said he supported the proposed listing because of the important role hippos play in ecosystems. “A large proportion of hippos are in rivers that are experiencing significant reductions in river flow. Threats like habitat destruction for agriculture are a huge issue,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/01/its-neocolonialism-campaign-to-ban-uk-imports-of-hunting-trophies-condemned-aoe\">‘It’s neocolonialism’: campaign to ban UK imports of hunting trophies condemned</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But given the right conditions, Stears said, populations could stabilise. “They can recover pretty quickly with enough vegetation. Any kind of protected area would be perfectly fine for the population to increase rapidly.”</p> <p>John Scanlon, secretary general of Cites from 2010 to 2018, said the upgrading to appendix I would involve the prohibition of all commercial trade in hippos, but would not outlaw bushmeat hunting. “It’s meat, teeth or skin: any commercial international trade would be prohibited.</p> <p>“A number of organisations will be offering their views on the proposal, and I suspect it will be a big deal,” he added. “There are only about 1,500 species that are classified on appendix I.”</p> <p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/02/matthew-guys-chief-of-staff-quits-over-proposal-for-party-donor-to-pay-his-company-directly","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T06:31:40Z","webTitle":"Victorian government asks police, Ibac to investigate proposed deal with Liberal donor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/02/matthew-guys-chief-of-staff-quits-over-proposal-for-party-donor-to-pay-his-company-directly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/02/matthew-guys-chief-of-staff-quits-over-proposal-for-party-donor-to-pay-his-company-directly","fields":{"headline":"Victorian government asks police, Ibac to investigate proposed deal with Liberal donor","trailText":"Matthew Guy’s chief of staff, Mitch Catlin, resigns over proposal for party donor to pay his company $8,333 a month","byline":"Benita Kolovos","body":"<p>The Victorian government has asked police and integrity bodies to investigate revelations the opposition leader’s chief of staff proposed to ask a Liberal party donor to make more than $100,000 in payments to his business, citing concerns about the compliance of the proposed deal with donation laws.</p> \n<p>Mitch Catlin resigned on Tuesday morning, after <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/guy-s-chief-of-staff-asked-wealthy-liberal-donor-for-payments-20220731-p5b607.html\">the Age revealed</a> he had forwarded a proposed contract to the state Liberal leader, Matthew Guy, last year that would have required a donor to pay $8,333 a month to his company, Catchy Media Marketing and Management, for services described as “supporting business interests”.</p> \n<p>Guy said he accepted Catlin’s resignation but maintained the contract was “never signed”, “never actioned” and “never formalised”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/its-not-2018-matthew-guy-learns-to-open-up-and-unite-his-party\">‘It’s not 2018’: Matthew Guy learns to open up and unite his party</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“This is not something that happened and stopped – it never progressed.

Job vacancies and job ads are at very high levels and a further decline in unemployment is expected over the months ahead.</p> \n<p>“Beyond that, some increase in unemployment is expected as economic growth slows. The bank’s central forecast is for the unemployment rate to be around 4% at the end of 2024.”</p> \n<p>In his response to the rate rise, Chalmers said: “Australians knew this was coming but it doesn’t make it any easier to handle.”</p> \n<p>“Loan repayments will bite deeper into family budgets already feeling the sting of high grocery and energy costs.”</p> \n<p>The chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), Gareth Aird, said the latest statement implied Lowe will be pragmatic about future rate rises.</p> \n<p>“We do not believe they are in a rush to take the policy rate much above their estimate of neutral [about 2.5%],” Aird said. “Indeed we expect that once the cash rate gets to around that level the RBA will pause to assess the impact that their policy tightening has had on the economy.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The CBA maintained its forecast for the cash rate to peak at 2.6%.

The judge also rejected Palmer’s claim he was not a political figure.</p> <p>McGowan was “sometimes unresponsive”, particularly in skirting questions about the medical advice of the chief health officer on WA’s hard border, but was “otherwise candid”, Lee said.</p> <p>Lee read at length extraordinary text messages from WA attorney general, John Quigley, about him “thinking of ways to beat big fat Clive” and “drop the big fat man on his big fat arse”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jeremy_gans/status/1554336966732566528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In an annexure to today&#39;s Palmer v McGowan defo judgment, fascinating &#39;how the sausage was made&#39; details on the statute <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HighCourtofAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@highcourtofaus</a> upheld in Palmer v Western Australia [2021] HCA 31: <a href=\"https://t.co/f1Qtqr3PkZ\">https://t.co/f1Qtqr3PkZ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/mnrgwVCj5X\">pic.twitter.com/mnrgwVCj5X</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy Gans (@jeremy_gans) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremy_gans/status/1554336966732566528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 2, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Lee said Quigley’s evidence in the trial was “confounding”, as he had changed his account of the truthfulness of an interview with the ABC spelling out the state’s legal strategy with respect to the bill.

But The Killer turned out to be a mere throat-clearing for Woo’s follow-up, Hard Boiled, which kicks off with a shootout in a teahouse filled with birdcages (bullets and feathers go flying) and builds to 40 minutes of pyrotechnics at a hospital that swings unforgettably through the nursery.</p> <p>Exploring the dualities that frequently pop up in his work, Woo teams his favorite star, Chow Yun-Fat, with another emerging Hong Kong legend, Tony Leung, as a police detective and an undercover agent who’s deep (perhaps <em>too</em> deep) in triad business. Their relationship raises the stakes of a gangland battle royale that Woo stages with elegant, slow-motion panache, a style that Hollywood would imitate shamelessly in the 90s and beyond, but rarely come close to replicating. <em>Scott Tobias</em></p> <h2><strong>The Five Deadly Venoms</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THld5wMeomY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/THld5wMeomY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After dozens upon dozens of the martial arts bonanzas cranked out by Hong Kong mega-studio Shaw Brothers (or their rivals at Golden Harvest) have fought to the death for my personal top-slot honors, only Chang Cheh’s opera of body blows and flying spin kicks will stand tall. Rightly endorsed by kung fu connoisseur and de facto Wu-Tang head honcho the RZA as the greatest of all time, Cheh’s canon classic breaks away from the pack on merit of its singularly brilliant gimmick, which convenes a gang of specialists with colorful signature styles against our vengeful hero. The wriggling Caterpillar, the precision-striking Snake, the pincer-footed Scorpion, the gravity-defying Lizard, and the indestructibly squat Toad supply the genre with a handful of immortal set pieces, each explicitly predicated on the same creativity required to pull off a great fight sequence. Our man Yang thinks along the same inventive lines as Cheh, searching for weak points instead of hiding them, constantly innovating a way to top his last feat of ass-annihilating prowess. <em>Charles Bramesco</em></p> <h2><strong>Once Upon </strong><strong>a Time in Mexico</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JrCqCz6CBA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7JrCqCz6CBA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There are plenty of better action movie directors than Robert Rodriguez. Hell, in 2003 Rodriguez’s good friend Quentin Tarantino released Kill Bill Vol 1, which is almost definitely a better action movie than Rodriguez’s Once Upon a Time in Mexico, which came out almost exactly a month earlier. But Once Upon a Time in Mexico is also my choice for favorite action movie, in the sense that – unlike Kill Bill, or Raiders of the Lost Ark, or any of number of other movies that could easily compete for the title – I probably like it more than anyone else does.</p> <p>Rodriguez’s finale to the makeshift trilogy that began with his El Mariachi and continued with Desperado sends the gun-and-guitar-toting Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) on a convoluted adventure, crossing paths with a nutty CIA operative (Johnny Depp) and a drug lord with face-altering surgery (Willem Dafoe), among others. More than ever, Rodriguez expresses character through his set pieces, whether hurtling the Mariachi and his wife (Salma Hayek) out of a hotel window as an act of doomed romanticism, or showing a CIA man’s desperation (and rat-like survival instincts) through a blind shootout. Throughout, the outlandishness ties the trilogy together thematically. Early on, when one character narrates a characteristically over-the-top action scene, he mentions the “embellishments” that come with such stories, underlining how Rodriguez keeps heightening the Mariachi’s story as the movies progress. In other words, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is an action movie about the escalating ridiculousness of action movies – and the value of that constant ante-upping. <em>Jesse Hassenger</em></p> <h2><strong>National Treasure</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHKA4hFo5M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zjHKA4hFo5M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As a child fascinated by, of all things, the American Revolution, the 2004 film National Treasure seemed like a dream – a movie in which old documents are a literal secret puzzle, solved by a man whose knowledge of basic American history trivia allows him to outsmart the FBI.

A very incomplete list of ridiculous elements: when they actually steal the Declaration of Independence; the fact that using lemon juice and a hair dryer on it doesn’t ruin it; Diane Kruger’s patchy American accent; the massive ancient treasure trove buried stories beneath downtown Manhattan that no one in the history of subway construction ever discovered. I simply have to take the generous view: National Treasure’s sincere delivery of the truly and utterly ludicrous is never not fun to watch. <em>Adrian Horton</em></p> <h2><strong>The Matrix</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUEQNVV3Gfs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nUEQNVV3Gfs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There are at least two reasons why The Matrix must be in the running for greatest action movie of all time: it set a new standard for the genre by redefining how action movies looked and felt, and it helped moviegoers around the world articulate why modern life felt so false, finding fans everywhere from the Christian church to the queer community. Incredibly, it did this via a slightly crazy, Baudrillardian thesis that real life was in fact a simulation created by machines that had enslaved humanity, offering a powerful revamping of the hero’s journey myth via a hacker-turned-messiah named Neo. But wait, there’s even more: the cherry on top is that this visionary movie was made by two transgender women (still closeted at the time) who conceived it as an allegory for what it feels like to be trans in a cis-dominated world. More than just an action movie, it was actually a subversive piece of queer art that is still relevant and necessary nearly 25 years after it was first released. <em>Veronica Esposito</em></p> <h2><strong>The Fifth Element</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqs9ycvKfD8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pqs9ycvKfD8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Action has never been my favorite film genre: there’s something fundamentally off, I find, about the participation in frantic onscreen activity while you are sitting completely still in a chair. Plus the sense that, as CGI has become ever more ubiquitous, that you are witnessing some risk-free, super-artificial maelstrom that represents no jeopardy whatsoever. That’s why, for me, the best action films are the most absurd and surreal, like Luc Besson’s space fable about love from the mid-90s. You get Bruce Willis in his mid-career pomp, but also mad Gaultier costuming, Milla Jovovich squawking a made-up language and a Stargate-style alien-pyramids subplot. Always worth a watch. <em>Andrew Pulver</em></p> <h2><strong>The Raid</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Q7KnXpNOg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m6Q7KnXpNOg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Call it an embarrassing sign of my age or a bleak comment on the sorry state of the industry or perhaps most likely a combination of the two but I find the majority of contemporary action sequences maddeningly hard to follow. The size of the spectacle might be increasing by the month (and the Marvel phase) but my involvement is steadily reducing, lack of interest bred by confusion. I often have a blackout reaction to massive, poorly stitched together set pieces, usually in the last act, where too much is happening and too little care for coherence and choreography is employed. My brain chooses nothing over everything.</p> <p>But back in 2012, an unlikely action thriller (made in Indonesia by the Welsh director Gareth Evans), was crafted with such careful precision that I found it impossible to turn away, let alone black out. The barebones video game setup (a squad of commandos must make it through a high-rise building filled with low-level henchmen in order to take down the local crime lord) was so generic that even another film that year – Dredd – boasted an almost identical plot. But the across the board A-game craftsmanship meant that the journey was like nothing we’d ever really seen, an immersive seat-edge series of thrillingly performed and edited fight scenes, the kind of hyper-competent action that makes you instinctively move your body along with every punch, kick and stab. It’s all deceptively simple but contains far more complexity than the majority of action films since. <em>Benjamin Lee</em></p> <h2><strong>Die Hard</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIOX44m8ktc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QIOX44m8ktc?start=13&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=13\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Alan Rickman’s wicked cool villain, Hans Gruber, speaks our language when leaning over a scale model of a bridge, purring about its “exactness” and “attention to every conceivable detail”. He could very well be describing Die Hard, a thrilling show of craftsmanship where every small bit of info pays out dividends.</p> <p>The first thing we learn about Bruce Willis’s off-duty NYPD cop John McClane is his anxiety about flying. That’s what gets him to try a socks-off relaxation therapy, which is interrupted by hostage takers and leaves him scurrying for the rest of the movie barefoot, going a few rounds with broken glass. Two hours after that initial introduction, McClane is flying off a skyscraper – damn the anxiety – now with bloodied feet.</p> <p>Die Hard became a blueprint for the modern action movie because its architecture is so perfect. But the irritable and vulnerable hero scaling its “40 stories of sheer adventure” (as the poster puts it) remains uncommon. There simply aren’t that many movies led by a cop who chooses to patiently hang back and run his mouth, instead of running in guns blazing. <em>Radheyan Simonpillai</em></p> <h2><strong>The Spook Who Sat by the Door</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3_8K1HgzMk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h3_8K1HgzMk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Based on the incendiary 1969 book by former foreign-service officer Sam Greenlee, Ivan Dixon’s deliciously subversive 1973 blowback fantasy of using white people’s own discrimination and misguidedness against them still shimmers with controlled rage – and unfortunate persistent relevance.</p> <p>It’s the fictional story of the first Black CIA officer (Lawrence Cook), a token affirmative-action hire in the late 1960s, who takes his spy training back to the streets of Chicago to spark a countrywide revolution, emphasizing community and education as the keys to overthrowing white supremacy. Stacked with characters who refuse to comply with Black Hollywood stereotypes of the era, the film also features a funky Herbie Hancock score that drops out during an extended sequence putting viewers in the middle of a riot following a police shooting of a Black man. Nearly 50 years after its release, it remains a sign of its febrile moment and “one of the most terrifying movies ever made”, according to one critic at the time; no surprise that the FBI allegedly quietly pulled it from theaters after its release. <em>Lisa Wong Macabasco</em></p> <h2><strong>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qI3PUT5a5I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6qI3PUT5a5I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The first Terminator is a leaner, meaner thing, which is why plenty of action buffs prefer it. But sometimes bigger <em>is</em> better, and more <em>is</em> more. In administering a shot of steroids to every element of his gritty sci-fi classic (the budget, the narrative, Linda Hamilton’s arms), James Cameron emerged with the platonic ideal of the summer blockbuster, delivering the goods more consistently and sensationally than nearly any Hollywood tentpole released before or since.</p> <p>There’s a “can you top this?” quality to T2 that’s just irresistible. What makes the movie a pinnacle of popcorn spectacle, beyond Arnold Schwarzenegger’s demigod star power as the most literal of killing machines, is the blend of practical and state-of-the-art digital effects used to bring its set pieces to life. Most big-budget action movies would kill for just one burst of pure rollercoaster excitement on the level of what Cameron keeps offering, minute by minute, in T2. He gets all the possible bang from his astronomically inflated buck. <em>AA Dowd</em></p> <h2><strong>Deja Vu</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxdS8TP37I4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uxdS8TP37I4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I spend entirely too much time asking entirely too many questions about Deja Vu: How did the ATF get budget for a time machine after 9/11? Why wasn’t Special Agent Carlin (Denzel Washington) taken off investigating the murder of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) when he was clearly in love with this dead woman? What happened to Jim Caviezel’s career? I appreciate that any attempts to ground this aughties classic in reality might come off as pedantic. But that doesn’t stop me from firing it up on HBO Max and suspending disbelief anew. So what if Deja Vu is a by-the-numbers, Save the Cat action flick. The damned thing just works. It’s paced by Tony Scott’s whipsawing direction, elevated by loaded performances from Washington, Caviezel, Val Kilmer and the delightfully manic Adam Goldberg. And it has all the concussive energy you’d expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced flick. (That poor, poor ferry boat …) Overthink it. Don’t overthink it. Either way, Deja Vu is a romp worth reliving time and again. <em>Andrew Lawrence</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/02/sky-tv-wont-give-my-mum-access-to-the-account-she-pays-for","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"Sky TV won’t give my mum access to the account she pays for","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/sky-tv-wont-give-my-mum-access-to-the-account-she-pays-for","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/02/sky-tv-wont-give-my-mum-access-to-the-account-she-pays-for","fields":{"headline":"Sky TV won’t give my mum access to the account she pays for","trailText":"It was shared with my father who has long gone, but he has to give his permission for any changes","byline":"Zoe Wood","body":"<p><strong>My mum is a longstanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bskyb\" title=\"\">Sky </a>TV customer, but, despite paying the bill for more than a decade, she has discovered she has no control over the account because it is in the name of my long-gone dad.</strong></p> <p><strong>When she sold her house to be closer to her family, she tried to change the address on the Sky account, but was told she could not without my dad’s permission or, indeed, even cancel.</strong></p> <p><strong>My parents had this account for more than 20 years, but split 14 years ago, are now divorced and we have no contact with my father</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>She has found herself in the bizarre situation of being able to pay for Sky (she has actually changed banks three times since taking over the payments) but not to own the account.</strong></p> <p><strong>Sky’s advice is to simply cancel the direct debit and walk away, but she is concerned this could leave a mark on her credit file.</strong></p> <p><strong>We were planning to get Sky Glass in her new property as she isn’t allowed a dish, but this has left us wondering if she shouldn’t just stick to Freeview.<br>JP, </strong><em>Ramsbottom</em></p> <p>Sky confirmed that any change of address, or cancelling, would require your father’s permission.</p> <p>It says: “As outlined in our terms and conditions, we require the account holder’s permission to cancel or move an account to prevent against any unsolicited cancellations.

Her latest play, Bogeyman, explores the question of what we fear and why. Its story is rooted in the history of the 1791 Haitian revolution, when the people overthrew the French colony to free themselves from enslavement. “Nobody knows about the uprising,” she says, “and I want them to know.”</p> <p>Unlike in British schools, Aboud’s Trinidadian education taught the importance of the Haitian revolution. “This was a story of the underdogs winning.” But the spiritual aspect of the event was missing. At her Catholic state school (she is now “a raging atheist”) she was never told that the uprising is thought to have started with a Vodou ceremony in Haiti’s Bois Caïman, the alligator forest. “There’s a whole wealth of community and spirituality that made this revolution happen,” Aboud says, “and we didn’t learn any of that because it’s considered ‘demonic’.” She wonders about the narrative she and her classmates were told about Vodou, the same one that proliferates around the world about the much-misunderstood religion. “Is it considered demonic because it’s what defeated the oppressor?”</p> <p>Growing up in Trinidad, Aboud attended Lilliput theatre, a drama group that has been running since 1975. Aboud is kinetic when she speaks, and never more so than when she’s talking about this group, which ingrained in her a total belief in the power of community. “It’s the greatest thing on the whole planet. I genuinely think that getting people together to talk and make stories together saves the world.” This training, which she then took on to student theatre at the University of Edinburgh, informs her process in the rehearsal room now, where she prefers to write, discuss and devise with cast and crew, before going back to writing again. She has just been shortlisted for 2022’s JMK award, an annual prize given to visionary young directors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68f931ce4baa4b3f6c56787b1a9b3f002f853761\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68f931ce4baa4b3f6c56787b1a9b3f002f853761/285_485_5114_3069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rehearsals for Bogeyman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rehearsals for Bogeyman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soon heading to the Edinburgh fringe, Bogeyman sits somewhere between ghost story and thriller. “I don’t want to do a jump scare, and I’m not into blood and guts,” Aboud says. “I don’t want to traumatise the people I’m trying to empower.” She is far more interested in the origins of fear. “There is a PhD to be written on the Haitian uprising and horror.” Zombie itself is a Haitian word, she points out, with roots in Haitian folklore and the injustices of slavery.</p> <p>By veering between 18th-century Haiti and modern-day London, Bogeyman explores how many modern fears are steeped in the continuing legacies of racism and empire. In discussions with her cast, they have shared feelings of living in a haunted city. “Looking at the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/history-tate/tate-galleries-and-slavery\">Tate Modern</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/museum/whats-on/slavery-and-the-bank\">Bank of England</a> – they are built from money from enslavement,” she says. “I can’t even watch Downton Abbey. I just want to burn it all down.”</p> <p>For Aboud, the revolution is an inspiration, but also a warning. In order to become independent, Haiti was made to repay the French for their loss of “property”. This debt, paid off in 1947, amounted to billions in today’s money, and has prevented the country from becoming economically stable. “The oppressed did win,” Aboud says drily, “but they’ve been punished ever since.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/06/edinburgh-festival-2022-50-shows-to-see-comedy-theatre-dance\">Edinburgh festival 2022: 50 shows to see</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So Bogeyman must be a celebration as well as a mourning. This double-edged approach was evident in her previous show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/23/splintered-review-soho-theatre-london\">Splintered</a>, which at once cheered Trinidad’s creation of carnival and the event’s embrace of queerness, and lamented the homophobia and misogyny many have to face in the rest of the year. “I think you need to have a sense of cynicism,” Aboud says of her feelings around Caribbean culture. “Nothing is black and white. It’s layered and complex.” That’s why Aboud called her theatre company Lagahoo, after the shapeshifter from Caribbean folklore. “Being allowed to be two things at once is really important to the work that I make.”</p> <p>Navigating the historical legacy of the Haitian revolution and the ripples of empire in present-day life, Bogeyman encapsulates Aboud’s desire to use storytelling as a tool for empowerment and understanding. “We are trudging along to fascism right here in the UK,” she says, her voice a blend of despair and disgust. “I feel really hopeless about that all the time. For me, the Haitian revolution is an amazing inspiration. They literally abolished enslavement, on one of the most profitable colonies in the new world.” Aboud wants this story to serve as a reminder. “We can get rid of the oppressor. It has been done.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bogeyman\">Bogeyman</a> is at Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, 3-29 August.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"law/2022/aug/02/us-supreme-court-liberal-justices-dissents-resistance","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"Bloodied but unbowed: liberal justices wield dissents as weapon of resistance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/aug/02/us-supreme-court-liberal-justices-dissents-resistance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2022/aug/02/us-supreme-court-liberal-justices-dissents-resistance","fields":{"headline":"Bloodied but unbowed: liberal justices wield dissents as weapon of resistance","trailText":"The three justices may be in the minority, but their opinions are sounding an alarm that equal rights are under threat by the new rightwing supermajority of the supreme court","byline":"Ed Pilkington","body":"<p>The US supreme court, with its new rightwing supermajority, is transforming America at breakneck speed. In a single judicial year, it overturned the right to an abortion, unleashed legally carried guns on to city streets, stymied government action to combat the climate crisis and Covid pandemic, and took a hatchet to the time-honored separation of church and state.</p> <p>Seasoned observers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck/status/1542530788851437573\">described the 2021-22 term</a> that ended in June as perhaps the most momentous in the court’s 233-year history. The six rightwing justices – three of them appointed by Donald Trump – demonstrated an iron grip over blockbuster cases.</p> <p>The three liberal-leaning justices, by equal measure – Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – were outnumbered and bloodied. When the court reconvenes in October, the retired Breyer will be replaced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ketanji-brown-jackson\">Ketanji Brown Jackson</a>, but the same punishing 6-to-3 dynamic will prevail.</p> <p>Bloodied but unbowed. The three liberal justices may be in the minority, but they are fast emerging as a vital resistance to the Trump-instigated judicial revolution now under way.</p> <p>That resistance is reflected in the dissenting opinions produced by the three. Not only were liberal dissents more in evidence in 2021-22 – Sotomayor alone <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/07/as-unanimity-declines-conservative-majoritys-power-runs-deeper-than-the-blockbuster-cases/\">wrote 13</a>, more than she has in any previous term – but the language deployed in them was also direct and unrestrained.</p> <p>The dissents went beyond polite disagreements over jurisprudence. They amounted to the sounding of an alarm, alerting the nation that equal rights, constitutional government, and even what it is to be an American, are all under threat.</p> <p>Here are six of the most visceral warnings contained in the dissents of the three liberal-leaning justices.</p> <p><strong>1. Attacking equal rights and individual freedoms</strong></p> <p>Over 60 white-hot pages of dissent, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan tore into the majority ruling in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\">Dobbs v Jackson</a> that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. Pointing out that such a right had been the law of the land for half a century, they decried the ruling as a full-on attack on an individual’s freedom.</p> <p>“After today, young women will come of age with fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers had,” the dissenting opinion said. From the moment of fertilization, “a woman has no rights to speak of”.</p> <p>The decision struck at the core of American values, they said. Individual freedom and equal rights “have gone far toward defining what it means to be an American. For in this nation, we do not believe that a government controlling all private choices is compatible with a free people.”</p> <p><strong>2. Overriding the will of Congress and that of the American people</strong></p> <p>The ultimate source of power in the United States is “we the people”. Today there are 240 million citizens eligible to vote for their representatives in Congress and president.</p> <p>And then there are the five men and one woman who control the supreme court and who are busily changing the face of America.</p> <p>The liberal-leaning justices accuse their rightwing peers of supplanting their own will over that of “we the people”. Kagan wrote the dissent to <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf\">West Virginia v EPA</a>, the majority ruling which hobbled the power of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to tackle the climate crisis by regulating fossil-fueled power plants.</p> <p>Kagan charges the six rightwing justices of ignoring clear instructions given to the EPA by Congress to address the “potentially catastrophic harms” of global heating. The justices had in effect rewritten the Clean Air Act in favour of their own policymaking.</p> <p>“The court appoints itself – instead of Congress or the expert agency – the decisionmaker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening,” Kagan said.</p> <p>In a separate 6-to-3 ruling, the supermajority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/biden-military-covid-omicron-spike\">blocked the Biden administration’s requirement</a> that employees of large businesses vaccinate themselves against Covid or take weekly tests. A <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a244_hgci.pdf\">dissenting opinion</a> from all three liberal justices said that, here too, the majority had negated the will of the people as expressed in the 1970 law that commanded the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) to protect workers “exposed to grave danger”.</p> <p>On the one hand, the dissent said, there is the Osha trying to protect employees from the “grave danger” of Covid. The agency is responsible to the president, who in turn “is responsible to – and can be held to account by – the American public”.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is the supreme court. “Its members,” the dissenters noted acerbically, “are elected by, and accountable to, no one”.</p> <p><strong>3. Undermining the integrity of the s</strong><strong>upreme c</strong><strong>ourt and the rule of law</strong></p> <p>The liberal-leaning justices accuse the supermajority of abandoning long-held legal principles in their rush towards radical change. Foremost of these is “stare decisis” – “to stand by things decided” – a respect for past precedents set by the court.</p> <p>By throwing out the right to an abortion established in 1973 by Roe v Wade, the six rightwing justices had disregarded stare decisis, and shown that “today, the proclivities of individuals rule. The court departs from its obligation to faithfully and impartially apply the law,” Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan wrote.</p> <p>The rightwing justices are very sensitive to the suggestion that they are acting according to political whim rather than legal principle. Last September, Clarence Thomas, arguably the de facto leader of the new supermajority, <a href=\"https://www.southbendtribune.com/story/news/2021/09/17/notre-dame-clarence-thomas-supreme-court-justice-lecture-south-bend-indiana/8370397002/\">irritably denied</a> the claim.</p> <p>“The media makes it sound as though you are just always going right to your personal preference,” he bemoaned.</p> <p>He need not look to the media for such an accusation. Three of his fellow justices have expressed it forcefully.</p> <p>In their dissenting opinion in Dobbs, the liberal justices noted that it took less than two years following the appointment of Trump’s third pick, Amy Coney Barrett, for the court to overthrow Roe v Wade. Such a rapid shift, they argued, could not be explained by any change in the social landscape of the country.</p> <p>The only thing that had changed was the composition of the court, and with it “the new views of new judges. The majority has overruled Roe for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now has the votes to discard them.”</p> <p>The consequences of the highest court being seen to be swayed by personal biases rather than legal principles are potentially cataclysmic. “It undermines the court’s legitimacy,” the dissenters warned.</p> <p><strong>4. One law for the rich, another for the poor</strong></p> <p>In their Dobbs dissent the three justices spell out the impact of ending of abortion rights for women of contrasting means. Wealthy women will “find ways around a state’s assertion of power”, travelling out of states that ban abortion to those where it is legal.</p> <p>Other women without the resources “will not be so fortunate”. They might resort to an illegal abortion and be harmed “or even die”; they might give birth to the child at great cost to themselves and their families; “at the least, they will incur the cost of losing control over their lives”.</p> <p>The dissenters warned that the consequences go beyond the devastating impact on individual women. A central pillar of the US constitution, of American values, has also been destroyed – equal protection under the laws.</p> <p>“The constitution will, today’s majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all.”</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Turning the clock back to the 18th</strong><strong> century</strong></p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf\">New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v Bruen</a>, the supermajority threw out New York’s restricted licensing regime for firearms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/23/us-supreme-court-new-york-law-gun-control\">opening the door</a> to concealed and loaded handguns being carried publicly in US cities.</p> <p>Thomas, who wrote the ruling, rejected any argument relating to the dangers posed by guns in modern America, where gun violence far exceeds that in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-us-gun-violence-world-comparison/\">comparable countries</a>. Instead, he argued that licensing regimes had to be consistent with “this nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation” and specifically with the way the US ruled in 1791 when the second amendment right to bear arms was ratified.</p> <p>In his dissent, Breyer said that this “history-only approach” not only ignored the “real and present danger of guns in modern American society”, it set a framework that was so rigid it would be impossible to apply to modern situations “beyond the Framers’ imaginations”.</p> <p>How, for instance, could centuries-old laws “dictate the legality of regulations targeting ‘ghost guns’ constructed with the aid of a three-dimensional printer?”</p> <p><strong>6. This is just the beginning</strong></p> <p>Perhaps the most chilling warning given by the liberal justices is that the hurricane of contentious rulings issued by the supermajority this term is not the end of the revolution – it is just the beginning.</p> <p>“No one should be confident that this majority is done with its work,” they write in their Dobbs dissent.</p> <p>The supermajority could go on to ban all abortions nationwide, from the moment of conception and with no exemptions for rape or incest. They could also use exactly the same arguments deployed to overturn Roe to go after contraception, the right to same-sex intimacy and marriage, and even interracial marriage.</p> <p>The logical conclusion of the supermajority’s legal tactics is that “all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-19th century are insecure … Additional constitutional rights are under threat.”</p> <p>Sotomayor closed her dissent in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1088_dbfi.pdf\">Carson v Makin</a> on a profoundly disturbing note. The 6-to-3 ruling bulldozed decades of precedent on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jul/02/us-supreme-court-religion-church-state-separation\">separation of church and state</a> by insisting that Maine had to extend its taxpayer-funded tuition assistance program to include students attending religious schools.</p> <p>“With growing concern for where this court will lead us next,” Sotomayor wrote, “I respectfully dissent.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/02/rail-route-of-the-month-finland-helsinki-north-karelia","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"Rail route of the month: gliding past Finland’s pristine forests and lakes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/02/rail-route-of-the-month-finland-helsinki-north-karelia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/02/rail-route-of-the-month-finland-helsinki-north-karelia","fields":{"headline":"Rail route of the month: gliding past Finland’s pristine forests and lakes","trailText":"Our slow travel expert explores Finland’s borderlands with Russia as she embarks on a 300-mile journey from Helsinki to North Karelia","byline":"Nicky Gardner","body":"<p>The monumental facade of Helsinki’s main railway station has an elegant symmetry. Four giant, granite men, each one holding a lantern, are there to greet me. It is before seven on a quiet Saturday morning and I am here on an eastbound mission, heading for the only passenger railway in the European Union to cross the 30th meridian east of Greenwich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2022-08-01T16:49:46.html\" data-alt=\"Finland rail route\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2022-08-01T16:49:46.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>From its train number, Finland’s IC1 service sounds as though it should be the most prestigious train in the country, just as 50 years ago the number TEE 1 was reserved for the premium Trans-Europe Express which dashed nonstop from Paris to Bordeaux. Finland’s IC1 doesn’t dash anywhere, averaging just over 60 mph on the 300-mile journey through lakes and forests to Joensuu, the administrative centre of the region which Finns know as Pohjois-Karjala (North Karelia). From Joensuu, it is another 100 miles and two hours on a local train to Nurmes, passing through gorgeous North Karelian countryside and crossing the 30th meridian along the way.</p> <h2>Border markers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a518a335eb15ff7e4eca9561b74b1c059823b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a518a335eb15ff7e4eca9561b74b1c059823b6a/0_0_4896_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helsinki’s central station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Granite statues and the clock tower of Helsinki’s central station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arsty/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Intercity train from Helsinki to Joensuu is nearly empty. What’s striking is the innovative interior design of the six-carriage, double-decker train. There’s a children’s play area, complete with slide, in one carriage, designated space for pets at the end of the train and elsewhere a choice of private compartments for two or four people (which can also be booked with a supplement by solo travellers), and some airy, open-plan carriages. I head for the restaurant car and a simple breakfast of oatmeal porridge with berries, accompanied by orange juice and coffee (all for €7.90).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ca72753ecf2ce69891364a5f5826cafcb020e090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca72753ecf2ce69891364a5f5826cafcb020e090/0_58_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The children’s carriage on the IC1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play time: the children’s carriage on the IC1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Studio Fotonokka Oy/VR Group</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now we are slipping out of Helsinki, passing sidings on the left where a couple of Allegro trains look very smart in the morning sunshine. Until late March, these sleek high-speed trains were used on the regular run to St Petersburg. The service was axed in protest at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the trains ran, St Petersburg was just three-and-a-half hours in Allegro comfort from Helsinki. Now the Russian city seems light years away.</p> <p>The IC1 from Helsinki to Joensuu runs close to the Russian border; at one point we cross the eastern arm of Lake Simpele, passing within half a mile of the frontier. For Finns, the eastern territories ceded to Russia in the second world war have been the subject of much myth-making, with stories of an idealised Karelian past which so inspired Finnish music, song, art and literature in the 19th century. The reality of life on the other side of the border is less romantic. “See those dark clouds?” asks the train manager pointing to the east. “That’s pollution from the Russian pulp mills at Enso,” he says, emphatically using the former Finnish name for the Russian community that is now called Svetogorsk.</p> <h2>Karelian identity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ccbaba9556540b43f23ba64885a275deac9186a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccbaba9556540b43f23ba64885a275deac9186a5/0_700_3712_2228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pielinen lake in north Karelia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pielinen lake in North Karelia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mauritius images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is an increasingly Russian feel to the landscape as the IC1 heads deeper into Finnish Karelia. There are Orthodox churches aplenty, easily identifiable by their distinctive cross, and many timber houses-cum-barns combined into very large two-storey buildings. The train’s pace slows as we cruise up the east shore of Pyhäselkä and enter Joensuu. It’s the end of the line for the IC1, and here those bound for rural outposts further north must change to a Czech-built railcar for the onward journey. Within a dozen minutes of arriving in Joensuu, we are on our way north, rattling over a white girder bridge that spans the fast-flowing Pielisjoki.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/04/rail-route-of-the-month-from-bohemia-towards-the-baltic-coast\">Rail route of the month: from Bohemia towards the Baltic coast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About 15 minutes later, we cross the 30th meridian east of Greenwich – the first of four occasions when our train passes that line of longitude. The easternmost railway station on the line (and thus anywhere in the European Union) is at Uimaharju, a village that lies as far east as St Petersburg. Uimaharju enjoys a fine lakeshore setting, slightly marred by a cluster of pulp mills and saw mills. Here, an Orthodox priest joins the train. We chat and he explains that Orthodoxy may be a mark of the east, but it’s not necessarily Russian. “The Finnish Orthodox Church is an official state church here in Finland,” he says, breaking off to point out a tiny wooden chapel capped by an Orthodox cross, in the forest by the railway. “That’s what we call a <em>tsasouna</em>,” he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad1db2017dd83ca66596772d1d5ca5c077501d82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad1db2017dd83ca66596772d1d5ca5c077501d82/0_0_2500_1875/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karelian-style wooden houses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karelian-style wooden houses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hidden Europe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The last 90 minutes of the journey, from Uimaharju up to Nurmes, is the finest part of the entire ride from Helsinki. When this line was built, the Grand Duchy of Finland was part of the Russian Empire, and there are moments when I feel transported back in time to the rural Russia of tsarist times. By now, the green-and-white diesel railcar has emptied out. We slip by clearings in the forest where rye and potatoes are grown, past Karelian-style wooden houses and some very fine wooden churches. This is a journey into another world, one that all too soon reaches Nurmes. On the approach to the town, we pass a huge farmstead which had been painstakingly moved, log-by-log, from its original location on the Russian side of the border. It’s a nice example of how Finland has “recreated” elements of Karelian culture and identity within its constrained, postwar borders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d44af71025f1546a9a3f3ab260f32bd754b8a7e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d44af71025f1546a9a3f3ab260f32bd754b8a7e0/0_188_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The end of the line in Nurmes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The end of the line in Nurmes, the furthest one can travel by train into North Karelia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hidden Europe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nurmes is a lovely wee township that is gearing up to mark the 150th anniversary of its founding by Tsar Alexander II in 2023. This rural community, perched on a narrow peninsula jutting into the northernmost part of Lake Pielinen, is a perfect spot to spend a day or two. While it is just possible to make a day trip from Helsinki to Nurmes and back, a round trip of more than 16 hours, the better choice is to stay overnight and then continue on by bus. The two main options are to head north-west through the Karelian forests to Kajaani or south-west to Kuopio, both well-placed on Finland’s mainline rail network. Both bus routes run once daily (except Saturdays), with a journey time of about two hours.</p> <h2>Travel notes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85ffd24e42b7c59a26d3122aeda521287f911e05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85ffd24e42b7c59a26d3122aeda521287f911e05/74_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Intercity train of VR Finnish Railways.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Intercity train of VR Finnish Railways.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rami Salle/VR Group</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IC1 leaves Helsinki daily except Sundays at 6.57am.

There’s more there than I’ve ever seen,” said McCarthy, who is originally from Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Writers who spoke to the Guardian credited McCarthy’s support, along with a collaborative ethos in the arts community and renewed interest from international audiences, but warned that the lowest per capita government arts funding in the UK could hold back progress.<br><br>Festival performers added that Northern Ireland was enjoying a comedy boom, with local comedians selling out top arenas previously reserved for major international names, and comedy nights and clubs rapidly proliferating.</p> <p>Joe Dougan, who manages most of the Northern Irish comedians performing at the fringe, said: “The Northern Ireland comedy scene has really exploded over the last few years, but the current crop of breaking talent has been in development for 10-15 years. Since 2019, an almost fully formed industry has emerged.”</p> <p>Northern Irish comics benefit from a voice that is “darker and edgier” than elsewhere, as a post-conflict nation, while a national predilection for humour means they push themselves harder to make “a crowd of people who are themselves comedians” laugh, said comedian Ciaran Bartlett.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/31/edinburgh-comedy-awards-nica-burns-fringe-40-years\">‘It comes down to taste’: how the Edinburgh comedy awards find tomorrow’s funniest stars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another comedian, Paddy Raff, said that he thought audiences were more aware of Northern Ireland’s similarities to other parts of the UK and Ireland, and familiar with the accent after Derry Girls, the Channel 4 teen sitcom. “People are more open to it rather than wondering, ‘Is this guy Scottish? Is he drunk?’”<br><br>He thought the scene had developed thanks to a shift away from a cultural discomfort with showing off, which meant it was “not the done thing to stand up and be funny behind a microphone”. “We are coming round to the fact we’re just as funny as anybody else and it’s a bit of an epiphany.”<br><br>Niamh Flanagan, director at Theatre and Dance Northern Ireland, which is organising a showcase of the country’s theatre, added that plays were now being made that wouldn’t have been possible 20 years ago.</p> <p>One at Edinburgh is Two Fingers Up, a show which takes a critical look at religious influence on sex education in Northern Ireland and features the tagline “a country of wankers” – intended to celebrate masturbation. <br><br>Its creators, Gina Donnelly and Seón Simpson, were warned this might stop them getting funding, but they have received grants from Culture Ireland and Queen’s University Belfast.</p> <p>“For a long time conservatism has censored the work but there’s now more of a desire to talk about global issues that affect Northern Ireland too – sexuality, class, gender politics – all those things that have been ignored in favour of looking at the Troubles,” said Donnelly.<br><br>Playwright Kat Woods, who is bringing her fifth play, Birds of Passage in the Half Light, to Edinburgh, said she thought other UK audiences had realised there was a “gap in teaching [about Northern Ireland] in schools”.<br><br>“There was a spike of interest when people started talking about Brexit. When people said it would be a bad thing for the union, for Northern Ireland, for a longer lasting peace, I got asked a lot of questions about it. That piqued interest in Northern Ireland, and Derry Girls has put us on the map,” she said.</p> <p>Liam McMullan, who is producing a play, In the Name of the Son, about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/21/gerry-conlon-guildford-four-dies-belfast-ira\">Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four, who was wrongfully convicted of being an IRA bomber</a>, added that audiences are interested in plays from Northern Ireland because they are “all true stories”.</p> <p>However, Flanagan warned there remains a serious funding gap. “Funding towards the arts has been decimated since around about 2011. We’ve a bit of work to do collaboratively so that hopefully in the future the arts here will be better valued by the decision-makers. But there isn’t a government or an agreed budget so it’s very hard, there’s a lot of political instability still.”<br></p> <p>• This article was amended on 3 August 2022.

I tried to express this in the gentlest and most patient way possible, by shouting, “What’s the point, though? What’s wrong with having some basic banking capability in your house, considering you never leave it?”</p> <p>“What if someone steals my phone?”</p> <p>“So they’ve stolen your phone.”</p> <p>“Then they can drain my bank account.”</p> <p>“Not without your pin. Nobody knows it except you.” (This is not exactly true: nobody knows it except <em>me</em>, and I have four more times I can repeat it before it vanishes out of my head).</p> <p>“But my phone knows, otherwise what would be the point of having a pin?”</p> <p>“Your phone can’t tell a thief your pin! That’s not how phones work.”</p> <p>She took a deep breath and said imperiously: “This is why it’s so unpleasant to be taught anything at my age; everyone takes this tone.” This would have been even more justified if she had been able to see my many gestures and facial expressions, but, luckily, I was standing behind her.</p> <p>Sure, we can blame failing eyesight – I have my own complaints to make about that – but I think it’s the tide of irrelevant nonsense, combined with the ever-present spectre of fraud, that defeats the over-80s. There are so many passwords and verifications that don’t matter – a dense thicket of security to go through just to get into Google Docs, or to fill in a form to verify a minicab account. You could forget them after it happened with no meaningful damage to your online security, except that if you can distinctly remember inputting card details, and you read somewhere once that clever thieves can steal those from anywhere, you have just destroyed your fragile peace.</p> <p>There’s a special place in hell for fraudsters that go after old-timers, but if I said that to a fraudster, they would probably say: “You know who might not end up in heaven?

That book told in revealing detail the rags-to-riches story of Sweden’s most celebrated footballer, born to a Bosnian Muslim father and Catholic Croat mother in a tough neighbourhood of Malmö. It was raw, unapologetic and, though ghostwritten, resounded with the unmistakable voice of this most egocentric of athletes.</p> <p><em>Adrenaline: My Untold Stories</em> revisits some aspects of that first book, but really it’s all about the AC Milan striker’s coming to terms with getting older – an unforgivingly accelerated process for those in elite sports. He turns 41 in October, which is an exceptional age still to be playing at the highest level.</p> <p>“When I was a young man,” he writes – or rather his ghostwriter, Luigi Garlando, does – “I was too in love with myself and I had a raging ego.”</p> <p>Now he says he’s a leader in a more mature way and more at home with himself. “Zlatan Ibrahimović is a happy man,” he concludes.</p> <p>Well, perhaps, but the most striking continuity between the young and mature versions of Ibrahimović is that he’s still referring to himself in the third person. He also speaks of being a god.</p> <p>Because he’s successfully turned egotism into a kind of ironic performance art, it’s often hard to tell how much is a provocative pose and how much he actually believes his own shtick. Certainly his newfound maturity has not led to a Zen-like acceptance of life’s travails that he likes to suggest in this book. Because you only have to turn a few pages to encounter another scene of Ibra getting worked up about some minor irritation or threatening to deck an opponent.</p> <p>He told Romelu Lukaku that he was going to break every bone in his body if he opened his mouth. And when the then Inter Milan player insulted the Swede’s wife (according to Ibrahimović’s account), he suggested his mother should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/27/the-fiver-zlatan-ibrahimovic-romelu-lukaku-and-some-serious-verbals\">do a voodoo spell</a>. Elsewhere, he complains that Italian football is hypocritical for taking an anti-racism stance but allowing football crowds to chant “Gypsy” at him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He dismisses the need for PR because, he explains, ‘It’s enough to be myself, and I’m perfect the way I am’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is, to put it mildly, a mass of contradictions. Almost every firm opinion he expresses – and he’s avowedly not a man looking for a fence to sit on – is negated by an equally strong opposing opinion, though usually without any recognition of the gap between the two. For example, he says he “can’t stand” footballers carrying on about their humble beginnings, while it’s a theme to which he repeatedly returns himself.</p> <p>And yet among the endless braggadocio and machismo there is something quite touching, even charming, about his intense relationship with himself. Unlike, say, Cristiano Ronaldo, the vanity comes with an appreciation of the absurd. He says he has had his tattoos all done on his back so he doesn’t have to look at them. And he dismisses the need for PR because, he explains, he has his own personal rule: “It’s enough to be myself, and I’m perfect the way I am.”</p> <p>Married to a heroically understanding woman who looks after their two children in Sweden while he plies his trade in Milan, Ibrahimović, it goes without saying, is a very long way from perfect. He is in many respects an overgrown child, but nonetheless one who, while he may not be as smart as he thinks, is smarter than his detractors allow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/06/zlatan-ibrahimovic-last-hurrah-football-manchester-united\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic: a player like no other to grace the Premier League | Observer profile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, his sense of timing, so exquisite in the 18-yard box, has let him down with this book. Since it was completed, two momentous events in his life have taken place. The first is that his agent Mino Raiola, whom he continually refers to as his best friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/mino-raiola-one-of-footballs-most-powerful-agents-dies-aged-54\">died in April this year</a>.</p> <p>And the second took place the following month, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/giroud-double-in-win-at-sassuolo-helps-fire-milan-to-first-serie-a-title-in-11-years\">Milan won their first Serie A title in more than a decade</a>. In truth, Ibrahimović played a limited role on the pitch, as a result of mounting injuries. But there is an argument – certainly one he’d agree with – that his imposing strength of character and indomitable self-belief helped transform a team of also-rans into ruthless winners. Because, for all his mouthiness, Ibrahimović is a proven winner.</p> <p>How he will fare when he finally has to hang up his boots is another matter. The thought of what he’ll do without that regular adrenaline infusion scares him “a little”, he writes. I suspect it scares him a lot. For when the crowds stop chanting his name, how will he remain Zlatan Ibrahimović?</p> <p>• <em>Adrenaline: My Untold Stories</em> by Zlatan Ibrahimović is published by Penguin (£10.99).

However, the underlying problem of food insecurity is not new. Between 2005 to 2014 the number of undernourished people fell from 811 million to 607 million. But for the last seven years hunger has been on the rise. By 2020, <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org.uk/press-releases/un-report-pandemic-year-marked-by-spike-in-world-hunger/\">811 million were undernourished</a>. This year is likely to be even worse.</p> <p>However, Vidal rejects the framing of this as a crisis of food, of which there is plenty. In fact, food production has been rising steadily for decades. “It’s really a crisis of poverty and distribution – people cannot afford to buy food that is there,” he says.</p> <p>Another big part of the problem is the kinds of food that are being prioritised: “So much land is devoted to growing crops for animals, especially cows, and that takes away land that can be used to provide ordinary people with grains or rice, for instance.”</p> <p>These are a recurring problem, caused by systemic issues in the global food industry, which have been exacerbated by recent crises. Food production is dominated by rich countries that give massive subsidies to the agricultural sector to produce food in certain parts of the world. These countries then export their surplus to poor countries, which undermines their domestic food industry. “Most farmers in low income countries have little to no support and they simply cannot compete with the cheap food that comes in from the US and Europe,” Vidal says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>2 The impact of war</p> <p>This current crisis is different because the circumstances are different. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has affected certain parts of the world far more than it has others. “There will be specific hotspots of crisis,” Vidal says. “Grain that would normally come from Russia and Ukraine has not been available in any large quantities, which has led to individual shortages for the countries that usually depend on it, like Egypt.”</p> <p>The war has also caused oil prices to surge, which has a knock-on effect on agriculture. “Most food is grown in a certain way, using heavy synthetic fertiliser, all of which depend on oil or gas. I’ve been talking to people in Malawi, where they traditionally grow maize, and fertiliser prices have tripled in the last six months, so they will be able to grow far less next year.”</p> <p>Whether or not an accord is reached in eastern Europe, the global food crisis will stretch into 2023. And there’s a significant chance it could get worse as people won’t be able to afford to grow food because of unstable oil prices.</p> <p>***</p> <p>3 What next</p> <p>Vidal laid out two plausible futures: “Pessimistically, this could become a permanent crisis. Or, optimistically, we could learn how to grow food sustainably, shifting the focus to feeding people, as opposed to animals.”</p> <p>So optimism rests on restructuring the food system to be fairer and more equitable – no easy task when four corporations control <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jun/02/abcd-food-giants-dominate-trade\">75-90% of the global grain trade</a>. To properly tackle the crisis of hunger, the global food industry has to be diversified so poorer countries aren’t held hostage by a few massive companies and can rely on their own food supplies to feed their people. And solving that problem could take even longer than bringing peace to Ukraine.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/01/woodstock-99-full-metal-racket-the-jaw-dropping-story-of-a-disastrous-music-festival\">Stuart Heritage spoke</a> with the producers of a new Netflix documentary, <strong>Trainwreck: Woodstock ’99</strong>, about how the music festival that once symbolised peace and love descended into chaos and violence. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>The Atlantic’s new <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/archive/\">digital archive</a> stretches back 165 years, and is a treasure trove of <strong>essays and reportage at flashpoints in history</strong>: from Rachel Carson on the oceans in 1937 and WH Auden’s bracing 1939 poem Crisis, published the day Germany invaded Poland, to Ta-Nehisi Coates’ watershed 2014 article about reparations for slavery. <em><strong>Craille Maguire Gillies, production editor, newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/dating-apps-relationship.html\">Allison P Davis’s compelling reflections</a> on a decade of <strong>Tinder</strong> for the Cut (£) offers both a short history of dating apps and a highly personal look at the human cost of 10 years of swiping. <em><strong>Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>In this incisive article, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/the-tory-leadership-candidates-have-been-cynically-posturing-on-trans-issues-but-who-are-they-impressing-with-their-spite\">Zoe Williams unpacks</a> why, during a cost of living crisis, both <strong>Tory leadership candidates</strong> have decided to posture about trans people in their campaigns. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/01/sanjeev-bhaskar-marriage-success-stereotypes\">Ammar Kalia’s warm interview</a> with <strong>Sanjeev Bhaskar </strong>delves into the impact of TV hits like Goodness Gracious Me and the contribution of British Asians to the arts. <em><strong>Hannah</strong></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Sport</h2> <p><em><strong>Commonwealth Games |</strong></em> Australia’s Emma McKeon<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/emma-mckeon-becomes-most-successful-commonwealth-games-athlete-with-11th-gold-medal\"> won her 12th Commonwealth gold</a> in the 50m butterfly, making her the Games’ most successful swimmer.

In 1988’s Rain Man, Tom Cruise is obliged to drive his autistic brother on a life-changing journey across America because the only airline Dustin Hoffman’s character will fly is the matchless – and unavailable – Qantas. So shamed were other airlines by the comparison, they <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/29/movies/airlines-cut-scene-from-rain-man.html\">used to cut</a> the key scene when the film played on their inflight entertainment.</p> <p>Local audiences cheered the scene when that movie came out.

It transforms every Qantas boarding experience into a game that combines sardines and Tetris in the worst, most unpunctual way.</p> <p>Since becoming Qantas CEO in 2008, Alan Joyce has distinguished himself in the Australian corporate community for the brutal enthusiasm with which he’s engaged corporate tactics at the company. It was Joyce who infamously stranded thousands of Qantas passengers around the world in 2011 when he grounded the entire fleet in a <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-29/qantas-locking-out-staff/3608250#:~:text=In%20a%20shock%20move%2C%20Qantas,fleet%20have%20been%20grounded%20indefinitely.\">fit of pique</a> at an industrial dispute.</p> <p>Nevermind that it was not aggressive industrial policy but – as Alan Kohler pointed out at the time – a drop in fuel prices that funded Qantas’s profit in dire trouble’s wake.

While milking the taxpayer teat for two-thirds of the value of the company, Qantas management did not maintain jobs.</p> <p>Instead, they sacked its unionised ground staff, exploiting a “window of opportunity” when workers weren’t physically at work and therefore unable to bargain. In late 2019 they unlawfully sacked <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/qantas-loses-appeal-over-unlawful-sackings-during-pandemic-20220504-p5aifb.html\">2,000 baggage handlers</a>, cleaners, aircraft towing crews and other ground crew whose professionalism is now so desperately missed.</p> <p>The money was instead spent on crushing Qantas’s competition.

Bad idea. To me, the term had a nice ring to it – a bit like “postmodern”. And in the same way postmodern architecture played with established language and traditions without necessarily sticking to the rules, I suggested a number of recent horror movies were doing the same: movies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/08/it-comes-at-night-review-dystopia\">It Comes at Night</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/10/a-ghost-story-review-rooney-mara-casey-affleck-david-lowery\">A Ghost Story</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/the-witch-review-a-eerie-campfire-tale-that-gets-under-your-skin\">The Witch</a>. The “horror community” wasted no time in telling me how wrong I was. Responses to my article varied from “It’s all just horror, duh” to “This is elitist snobbery” to “You can’t possibly weigh on this subject because you haven’t watched as many horror movies as I have”.</p> <p>“All Rose is really saying in his article is ‘I don’t like horror, so these particular films must be something else,’” argued <a href=\"https://www.walesartsreview.org/cinema-a-response-to-post-horror/\">one online article</a>, which concluded: “using platforms of cultural gate-keepership … to denigrate a persistently rich and popular genre with little mind to nuance is more than simple cultural distinction, it’s shoddy journalism.” Well that was me told. I hadn’t experienced such vitriol since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/25/world-of-warcraft-the-beginning-review-end-already-nigh\">my two-star review</a> of the World of Warcraft movie.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I hadn’t experienced such vitriol since my two-star review of the World of Warcraft movie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wasn’t really trying to plant a flag and say: “I have discovered this hitherto unmapped realm of horror.” Nor was I looking down on the rest of the horror canon. I love horror movies – the trashy, gory ones as much as the refined arthouse ones. I’m old enough to have misspent my youth rewinding and replaying in slo-mo the exploding head scene on a video copy of David Cronenberg’s Scanners. I was just putting out a term to describe something, and seeing if other people liked it. A lot of them didn’t, it turned out, but some did. I get regular inquiries about the concept of “post-horror” from film students. Recently, I came across an academic book titled <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctv1c29rk1\">Post Horror: Art, Genre and Cultural Elevation</a>, written by David Church, a postdoctoral fellow in gender studies at Indiana University. And this month, the Barbican cinema in London launches a series of “<a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2022/series/post-horror-summer-nights\">Post-Horror Summer Nights</a>”, featuring some of the films I discussed in my original piece.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"defb14515f5f23191937a256a52dd1035c2268bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/defb14515f5f23191937a256a52dd1035c2268bc/0_81_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riley Keough in It Comes at Night, directed by Trey Edward Shults.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I didn’t set out to make a horror movie’ … Riley Keough in It Comes at Night, directed by Trey Edward Shults.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neither Church’s book nor the Barbican’s film season apply the term in exactly the way I meant it. In fact, Church dismisses mine as “one of many flawed attempts to name a corpus of recent films”, alongside other terms such as “smart horror” or “elevated horror” – basically telling me I’m using my own definition wrongly. But then I never really laid out a rigid definition at the time. Now post-horror is even more of a thing, perhaps I ought to.</p> <p>It began with an interview with the film-maker Trey Edward Shults in 2017. Then in his late 20s, Shults had just released his accomplished second film It Comes at Night. The title suggests something you might find on a grindhouse double-bill alongside, say, Night of the Living Dead or Blood Sucking Freaks. And Shults’s film does incorporate some classic horror elements: a post-apocalyptic scenario, a cabin in the woods, violent deaths, ominous noises on the soundtrack and suspenseful tracking shots. But the “It” of the title is not a monster, a virus or anything definable. The film is more ambiguous than that, examining matters of tribalism, paranoia, family and fear itself. It was released on more than 2,500 screens in the US, and mainstream audiences hated it. It got a <a href=\"https://www.cinemascore.com/\">D CinemaScore</a>, and plenty of “worst movie ever” reactions online.</p> <p>“I didn’t set out to make a horror movie per se,” Shults told me, explaining how the movie was informed by the recent death of his father, among other things. “I just set out to make something personal … I put a lot of my own fears into it. And if fear goes to horror then, yeah, it’s horror. But I don’t think it’s a conventional horror movie.”</p> <p>When I told Shults I was tempted to describe it as “post-horror”, he replied: “Sure! I love that.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQXmlf3Sefg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iQXmlf3Sefg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I had noticed other films around that time that were doing similar things. Robert Eggers’ The Witch, for example, a folk horror set in the 16th century that seemed more interested in historical authenticity than jump-scares. Again, it got terrible audience scores initially, from punters who were presumably expecting a straight-up horror flick. Or Nicolas Winding Refn’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/07/neon-demon-review-film-nicolas-winding-refn-elle-fanning-fashion-horror\">The Neon Demon</a>, which collided vampires and occult symbolism with the modern fashion industry. Or Olivier Assayas’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/personal-shopper-review-kristen-stewarts-psychic-spooker-is-a-must-have\">Personal Shopper</a>, which incorporated supernatural elements into a story of grief and dislocation, without really playing as a horror movie. Or especially David Lowery’s A Ghost Story. This film does feature a ghost – complete with white sheet with two cut-out eyeholes – but nobody can see it so it isn’t that scary. “I wanted to engage with the archetypes and iconography of ghost films and haunted-house movies without ever crossing over into actually being a horror film,” Lowery told me at the time. That pretty much sums up the post-horror mode.</p> <p>Looking around, I saw other films I could put in the post-horror basket. The works of Peter Strickland, for example. His magnificent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/30/berberian-sound-studio-review\">Berberian Sound Studio</a>, from 2012, is steeped in the trappings of pulp 1970s Italian horror film-making, whose iconography spills over into the main narrative centred on Toby Jones’s increasingly disturbed foley artist. Is it a horror movie itself? Not exactly. Likewise, Strickland’s 2014 follow-up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/19/the-duke-of-burgundy-review-peter-strickland\">The Duke of Burgundy</a>, which paid stylistic homage to erotic 70s horrors such as Vampyros Lesbos but twisted them into something altogether stranger.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"deb3d7843f529fb733031378a7ec5f901a248f85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deb3d7843f529fb733031378a7ec5f901a248f85/555_0_2491_1496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, directed by Ana Lily Amirpour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Something extraordinary … A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, directed by Ana Lily Amirpour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By definition, film genres have rules. But to an extent, most great horror movies subvert these rules, or use them to broach subjects society finds it difficult to deal with head-on. But let’s also be honest, a great many horror movies just rehash familiar tropes to the point of cliche. Horror is one of the few genres that can still generate box office returns for minimal outlay in today’s squeezed movie landscape. Even if only one in 10 is a hit, you can still turn a profit. So you don’t have to be an elitist snob to notice that we’ve had a lot of rubbish horror movies foisted upon us in recent years.</p> <p>Another downside of today’s movie landscape is that it is even harder for budding auteurs seeking to make their name. So horror is a way of getting through the multiplex door. When you listen to film-makers such as Shults or Eggers or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/horror-director-ari-aster-hereditary-midsommar-terrors\">Ari Aster</a>, director of Hereditary and Midsommar, each of whose films were distributed by A24, their heroes aren’t horror masters such as Sam Raimi, Dario Argento or George Romero, they’re arthouse directors like Ingmar Bergman, Roman Polanski and Robert Altman – all of whom made movies that could fit into the post-horror category, as it happens.</p> <p>Eggers drove the point home when I interviewed him for his movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/19/the-lighthouse-review-robert-pattinson-shines-in-sublime-maritime-nightmare\">The Lighthouse</a> in 2019. A trippy, black-and-white two-hander, it had elements of horror – allusions to Edgar Allan Poe, mermaids, sea monsters – but it was far from an out-and-out horror movie. Eggers talked about how difficult it is for any film-maker in today’s climate to get an unconventional, “personal” film funded. But the industry is more willing to back something if it fits into a genre, especially horror. “They knew that The Lighthouse was more of an arthouse movie than anything else,” said Eggers, but they also knew they could “lean on” the horror aspects to market it, which helped.</p> <p>Many of these film-makers have moved on. Eggers has since shifted to epic action fantasy with The Northman, Shults traversed into artful teen drama with his most recent film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/16/waves-review-drama-trey-edward-shults-peter-bradshaw\">Waves</a>. Lowery made the Robert Redford thriller The Old Man and the Gun before returning to post-horror territory with last year’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/24/the-green-knight-review-dev-patel\">The Green Knight</a>, a dark, mystical, violent Arthurian tale combining fantasy and horror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a425f18ed71866c272090ef00d38f0c831ce989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a425f18ed71866c272090ef00d38f0c831ce989/0_77_2133_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Jones in Berberian Sound Studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not exactly horror … Toby Jones in Berberian Sound Studio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinematic Collection/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whatever your feelings about the label post-horror, we can surely agree something extraordinary was happening in cinema in the mid-2010s. In addition to the movies above, the years 2014 to 2018 also gave us It Follows, The Babadook, Raw, Split, A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, Under the Shadow, Green Room, A Quiet Place and Jordan Peele’s phenomenal Get Out. Plus, entertaining franchises such as The Conjuring, Sinister and The Purge cleaning up at the box office. Is it too soon to look back on it as a golden age?</p> <p>For me, many of the aforementioned films are more conventional horror than post-horror, in that they set up traditional genre expectations and fulfil them. But then, what are the boundaries? How much can you subvert the rules before you’re not in the genre any more? Who decides? Clearly not me. But that is the grey area I was trying to give some definition to. I don’t mind if people adopt the term post-horror, reject it or adapt it to mean something else entirely – which is kind of what’s happened. Perhaps my fellow film writer Matt Zoller Seitz put it best, a couple of years ago, on Twitter. Weighing in on a similar debate over the term “elevated horror”, he wrote: “Elevated horror is like an artisanal cheeseburger. Make the goddamn cheeseburger. If it’s delicious, nobody will care what adjective you put in front of it.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2022/event/post-horror-summer-nights-it-comes-at-night-intro\">Post-Horror Summer Nights</a> begins at the Barbican cinema, London, with It Comes at Night, introduced by Steve Rose, on 4 August</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/chinese-seafarers-were-coerced-into-leaving-uk-after-war-home-office-admits","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"Chinese seafarers were coerced into leaving UK after war, Home Office admits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/chinese-seafarers-were-coerced-into-leaving-uk-after-war-home-office-admits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/chinese-seafarers-were-coerced-into-leaving-uk-after-war-home-office-admits","fields":{"headline":"Chinese seafarers were coerced into leaving UK after war, Home Office admits","trailText":"Exclusive: secret deportations campaign, which separated families, was racially inflected, report says","byline":"Dan Hancox","body":"<p>Chinese seafarers with British wives and children were “coerced” into boats leaving Liverpool after the second world war in a “racially inflected” secret government programme, the Home Office has admitted.</p> <p>After responding to calls to serve in the British merchant navy in the Battle of the Atlantic, about 2,000 Chinese seamen remained in Liverpool at the end of the war.

These events are a stain on our history and unfortunately there are still many parallels with the way minoritised and migrant workers are treated in our country today.”</p> <p>A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party deeply regrets the policy of the 1945 British government that saw the repatriation of an unquantified number of Chinese seafarers who had supported the war effort and in doing so fathered children in the UK. The policy of repatriation caused lasting damage to families, and scars that have run deep through several generations.”</p> <p>While the Home Office investigation has brought some new details to light, it has not turned up a central record of all the repatriated seamen, and the report concedes that a great deal of information is still missing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Missing files include those belonging to special branch, whose officers carried out covert raids on private homes and boarding houses in Liverpool after the war to investigate the “genuineness” of the marriages. “No trace of these [special branch] investigations remains,” the report says.</p> <p>Further gaps in the record can be attributed to the fact that many thousands of Chinese seamen were repatriated on ships on which their names were never recorded.

The TV presenter, best known for her appearances on Loose Women and presenting the Paralympics, travels all the time for work – she films all over the world – and she knows what she is doing. But, because she is a wheelchair user, “every single flight is a risk”, she says.</p> <p>For disabled people such as Morgan and me, air travel is perhaps uniquely stressful. There are so many things that can go wrong, alongside a shocking lack of dignity. Will they allow our wheelchair through security, or will we be forced on to airport chairs that we can’t use independently? Will the wheelchair be left behind at the gate, leaving us stranded? Will it be broken en route, ruining a work trip or a holiday? Will assistance come before boarding closes? Will we be hurt as we are manhandled on to the plane?</p> <p>None of these worries, however, come close to the big one: are we going to be left behind? Once all the passengers are off, this question rumbles around our heads as we crane to see whether assistance is coming. If it doesn’t come, we are stranded. Despite there having been years of campaigning for wheelchairs to be stored in the cabin, most airlines insist on sending them down to the hold. This means there is often a delay in bringing the chair back up to the cabin door at the end of the flight. And, of course, planes are still designed with aisles too narrow for standard wheelchairs, meaning anyone who can’t walk off the plane must wait for staff to help them with a specially made aisle chair (which is not designed to be used independently).</p> <p>This problem finally came to public attention in June when a disabled passenger <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/17/death-of-disabled-passenger-at-gatwick-airport-prompts-investigation\">died at Gatwick airport</a> after falling from an escalator. He had chosen not to wait for assistance. While Gatwick and Wilson James, the company responsible for assistance at the airport, said there wasn’t a shortage of staff at the time, all disabled people know that adequate staffing is no guarantee we won’t be left behind. If you are in desperate need of the loo, because you haven’t been able to go on the plane (it is 2022, but airlines still don’t provide disabled toilets), sometimes the only option is to take matters into your own hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85b78f1e4bcf96e23fc9ad222f5b369781fdb775\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85b78f1e4bcf96e23fc9ad222f5b369781fdb775/0_0_960_640/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Morgan is regularly stranded while taking flights.\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Morgan is regularly stranded while taking flights.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Rumford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It happens all the time, says Morgan. In April, she was stranded when she returned from a filming trip in Helsinki. She hadn’t been warned in advance that the plane didn’t carry an aisle chair, so she spent the entire flight stressed about being unable to go to the toilet. She was desperate to get off the plane to be reunited with her wheelchair and her autonomy, but no assistant arrived.</p> <p>She asked the cabin crew how long the wait would be. “They just shrugged. No one offered any reassurance,” she says. “Meanwhile, I’m terrified I’m not going to get to the loo in time.” Her travelling companion could see her wheelchair on the bridge, but she had no way to reach it. Forty minutes after landing, an assistant appeared – but they couldn’t help Morgan use the aisle chair. They hadn’t been trained and were obliged to wait for another member of staff. There was no apology.</p> <p>Eventually, Morgan’s companion did what many are forced to do: he grabbed the aisle chair and got her off the plane himself. “Definitely against insurance policy,” Morgan says, half laughing, half groaning. Even once she was in her own wheelchair, no one helped – or apologised.</p> <p>This is just one of Morgan’s many stories of being denied the assistance she needs and to which she is entitled. I ask how she maintains the confidence to travel so often. “I travel a lot, but never without fear,” she says. “It sounds awful, but I just expect the worst, then I plan what I’ll do if the worst happens – if I wet myself, if I’m stranded, if I’m dropped, if my chair is damaged. I’m always kind of in a state of distress.”</p> <p>The distress is heightened because, in order to avoid needing the loo too soon, she restricts her food and drink intake the day before she flies. (On long-haul flights, there is usually an aisle chair, but if you need a carer or can’t stand at all, you just have to wait.) It is a degrading choice to make, but “in the end, travelling is so worth it. I think of it like an extreme sport – I know there’s every chance it’s going to end in tears, but if I want to do it, I’ve got to risk it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6edd8ebbbac82818fe9a8e12a5922845f005bb35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6edd8ebbbac82818fe9a8e12a5922845f005bb35/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Morgan receives assistance to board a plane.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Morgan receives assistance to board a plane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most disabled people know the gnawing stress of air travel, but everyday journeys can be just as anxiety-inducing. Many will be familiar with the almost mundane experience of being left stranded on a train. Shona Louise, a theatre photographer, often travels around the UK for work, particularly in and out of London, from her home in St Albans. “Ninety per cent of the time, especially on routes I know, everything is fine,” she says, emphasising that she doesn’t want to put other disabled people off travelling alone. “The problem is that when things <em>do</em> go wrong, they go really badly wrong.”</p> <p>As a powerchair user, she is reliant on someone turning up with a ramp. The most common problem is when the member of staff who puts Louise on the train forgets to call ahead to the station where she is getting off. “They can’t help me if they don’t know I’m coming,” she says. Sometimes the destination station staff are aware that she needs help, but are waiting on the wrong platform, or at the wrong time. “That stings the most,” she says, because she is being let down by the system, not just human error. “There should be a way for disabled people to get themselves help, rather than relying on people to remember.”</p> <p>After too many experiences of being forgotten and missing her stop – and therefore heading towards a station where no one is aware she needs help – Louise has learned to block the train doors with her chair. This, she acknowledges, is dangerous, but sometimes it is the only way to get the onboard guard’s attention. It is her only choice – missing her stop “can change or ruin your whole day”.</p> <p>Louise often travels late at night, after shows have finished, adding to the stakes. If she misses her stop and has to get out at another station, she won’t have any way of getting home. “It’s scary and disorientating,” she says. In these situations, her only options are to block the doors or press the emergency button. This can annoy staff and fellow passengers, because it causes delays, but Louise insists disabled people have every right to keep themselves safe when the system doesn’t. “I’m a confident traveller and I won’t be put off because I have to get to work, but when I’m stuck and can’t get home, it is horrendous. It’s really emotionally taxing.”</p> <p>Transport for All, a pressure group working to make public transport more accessible, emphasises that it is not just people with mobility impairments who are left stranded. Blind and visually impaired passengers may also need help to navigate busy airports and stations, as may some neurodivergent people. “It is vital that disabled people can trust that staff will be on hand, but unfortunately this is not happening,” says Katie Pennick, the group’s campaigns manager. Official data shows that only 75% of booked assistance is received (no data exists for assistance arranged at stations). “The impact of this cannot be overstated … it can put people off and be a real barrier to travelling.” She emphasises that this doesn’t only affect people travelling for leisure, but can make commuting to work or appointments, as Louise and Morgan do, extremely difficult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"316ea9275cf84c7935934cd270624f3e1a750522\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/316ea9275cf84c7935934cd270624f3e1a750522/0_0_1667_2500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Shona Louise.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shona Louise: ‘When things go wrong, they go really wrong’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liza Heinrichs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both women say that bad attitudes compound the structural issues. Being forced to wait for assistance, as if we are a glorified piece of luggage, is dehumanising in itself – and then we are treated as an inconvenience. Staff act as if we are the ones making their lives difficult.</p> <p>Morgan happened to be travelling from Gatwick the day after the disabled man died on the escalator, when details of the incident were still unknown. As she was taken through the airport, she asked the man assisting her whether there was any more information about what had happened. “All he did was talk about the impact it had had on Wilson James staff,” she says. “I was so incensed. I thought: ‘How can you be looking at me, a wheelchair user, and saying that was the hardest thing?’ It just tells you everything you need to know about the company.”</p> <p>After the incident, Wilson James said in a statement: “The agent was at the gate within one minute of the aircraft parking on its stand, and the incident itself only happened 10 minutes after the aircraft landed. The agent who handled the passenger is very experienced, has been working in this service for a number of years and has a background working with people with complex disabilities and needs in the care sector.”</p> <p>This is not the only example of airport staff blaming disabled people that Morgan has seen this year. As she was waiting to board another flight, an announcement was made, explaining that boarding had been delayed because a disabled passenger from the previous flight was still on the plane. “It didn’t mention that assistance hadn’t turned up. And then they had to get off in front of all these annoyed people,” Morgan says. It can’t be right that going on holiday as a disabled person so often involves public humiliation.</p> <p>Mel Kennedy uses a walking frame, which she says means train staff don’t always take her need for the ramp seriously. She, too, has been blamed for service failure. On the way home from a trip to meet a friend, the guard hadn’t come past her during the journey and so didn’t know she was onboard. No one had radioed to tell him, either. At her stop, she pressed the call button, but no one came. Luckily, other passengers pressed their buttons, too, and eventually the guard arrived – just in time.</p> <p>As the guard was putting the ramp down, he made a remark to another passenger: “Well, to be honest, she should have told the station staff.” But, of course, she had told the staff where she set off, and there was no one to tell at her destination – it is an unmanned station. Kennedy worries that things will only get worse as more stations lose their staff, a concern shared by Transport for All. Kennedy says that the stress of some of her recent journeys has made her pull out of trips with friends unless they are going somewhere familiar.</p> <p>Pennick says that a solution comes in three parts: “Money, resources, and prioritisation. There needs to be a culture change in government and in the transport sector – accessibility must be seen as a core, fundamental and non-negotiable part of a functioning public transport network, in the same way as safety and sustainability.” She adds: “Sadly, too often, accessibility is seen as a nice-to-have, or a luxury that can be scrapped when money gets tight.”</p> <p>Ultimately, the disabled people I spoke to want transport systems to be designed so that we don’t even need assistance – for all trains to have level boarding and for mobility aids to be welcomed on flights. But this is going to take time. In the meantime, Pennick says, “decision-makers must listen to disabled people – especially when changes to services are being considered. There is a slogan in the disability rights movement: ‘Nothing about us without us,’ and at Transport for All we firmly believe that it’s only when the lived experience of disabled people is applied to the design, planning, running and evaluation of services that they will truly offer access for all.”</p> <p>Change is desperately needed. Morgan, Louise, Kennedy and thousands like them are tired of being left behind.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/02/labour-power-keir-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T05:00:43Z","webTitle":"Not radical enough?

As minor skirmishes break out within the party, Labour people should keep their eyes firmly fixed on that prize. All the disasters must belong to the Tories.</p> <p>By the end of this year, Keir Starmer may be in No 10, with the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, next door, and with a cabinet table filled with serious new ministers hitting the ground running, after Liz Truss (let’s assume it’s her) has “hit the ground”, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/1549775201558269953\">she mis-tweeted</a> recently. The Tory cabinet will fade as if a bad dream: surely Nadine Dorries, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Suella Braverman, Grant Shapps and the rest never happened?</p> <p>But right now, expect Prime Minister Truss to get a poll bounce, which is why she may grab her only election chance sooner rather than later. Even if she waits for 2023’s boundary changes to come into effect, those extra five to 10 seats won’t be able to outweigh the electoral damage of an escalating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/01/more-than-one-in-eight-uk-households-fear-they-have-no-way-of-making-more-cuts\">cost of living calamity</a>. </p> <p>Nothing but trouble awaits her, shackled to those impossible pledges. Her low-tax bidding war leaves no money. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has exploded the fantasy that tax cuts bring growth. If so, <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/tory-leadership-candidates-need-to-face-reality-on-tax-pledges-paul-johnson-ifs\">the IFS says</a>, why have countries with higher tax than ours, such as France and Germany, achieved higher growth? The Conservatives’ plans only allow for unacceptable 2-3% increases in public-sector pay. Meanwhile, services are already collapsing, with backlogs of 6.6 million people waiting for NHS England operations, 60,000 court cases pending in England and Wales, and 90% of English schools waiting for urgent repairs. So where will her “smaller state” cuts come from?</p> <p>The damage from Brexit will harden if Truss breaks the Northern Ireland protocol, triggering an EU trade war. If she veers an inch from a rock-hard Brexit then the European Research Group will make her life hell. Her vociferous climate refusers will keep her to abolishing green levies and “not letting net zero affect business”, while long-neglected infrastructure is exposed in energy and water shortages. Boris Johnson sitting behind her, yearning to return, will relish every failure.</p> <p>Whenever the general election comes, Labour looks likely to win: governments fall when voters suffer unmanageable drops in income. A wave of social democratic wins in Australia, Germany, US, Portugal, Norway, Finland, Denmark and others augurs well. <a href=\"https://www.markpack.org.uk/155623/voting-intention-opinion-poll-scorecard/\">Recent polling</a> from Savanta ComRes, Survation, Ipsos and more put the Labour lead in double digits.<strong> </strong>Starmer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RedfieldWilton/status/1551963199137775617/photo/1\">beats either contender</a> as best prime minister when “red wall” voters are asked, according to fresh polling from Redfield &amp; Wilton Strategies.</p> <p>When the new Tory leader gets a poll bounce, expect impatient Labour people to panic at Starmer’s caution. He only says what he’s against, they complain.<strong> </strong>Yes, to stop the Tories gleefully turning the election into another Brexit rout, it was essential (though painful) to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/04/starmer-ends-labour-silence-on-brexit-as-he-rules-out-rejoining-single-market\">take a stand against</a> rejoining the single market or customs union: the word “rejoin” ignites old fires. But there’s no doubt the party would make EU peace and trade deals, join the Horizon and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-47293927\">Erasmus programmes</a>, and agree equal food and goods standards, easy visas for artists, agree EU professional qualifications and more. I back rejoin movements – but I don’t think Labour should.</p> <p>It’s the same with strikes. All of Labour backs the fight to prevent massive cuts for those whose pay fell or stagnated for a decade. Strikers stand for everyone, the un-unionised are pulled up by union rates. But Starmer is not wrong to think that a convincing government-in-waiting shouldn’t be seen as protesters: parliament is their forum. Labour shadow ministers gnashed their teeth over the picket line grandstanding of Sam Tarry, who reacted to the prospect of being deselected in Ilford South by claiming, “I am on the side of ordinary British workers”, as if the rest weren’t. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/23/mick-lynch-rail-union-bruiser-whos-more-than-a-match-for-the-media\">Mick Lynch</a> is a great advocate, but the shadow cabinet has a more complex task than he does.</p> <p>The party’s position, as a senior Labour official tells me, is “100% behind the right to strike” and “to make sure workers get the pay they deserve”. The commitment to ending “the scourge of low pay” means Labour would introduce<strong> </strong>fair pay agreements across every sector: no zero-hour contracts, no fire-and-rehire, flexible working and the right for unions to recruit in every workplace. The £28bn Green New Deal will create good jobs setting up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/02/labour-pledges-to-create-30000-jobs-at-electric-car-battery-gigafactories\">electric car battery factories</a> and insulating 19m homes.</p> <p>Last week’s howl at Starmer and Reeves’ betrayal was over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/starmer-says-he-wont-be-ideological-labour-renationalisation-row\">renationalising utilities</a>. But is it wise for Labour to spend billions buying these back, before spending on them or anything else? As Reeves’s team pointed out, rail is effectively state-owned already. Pragmatism means super-tough regulation can do more without wasting a penny. Southern Water is imposing hose pipe bans while reportedly<strong> </strong>leaking 21m gallons a day. Who wants to pay its owner, the investment bank Macquarie, who loaded it with another £1bn debt while its CEO earns £14.8m? England’s water regulator, Ofwat, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/debt-ridden-water-giants-at-risk-from-rate-rises-bf2rngmt6\">warns</a> that rising interest rates will see some water companies go bust – that needs state takeovers.</p> <p>As for Labour’s taxes, Reeves says she will target the £174bn lost in tax relief loopholes, so “the broadest shoulders” pay most. She would take another £5bn windfall from energy profits. Making private equity managers pay income tax on earnings that they pretend are “carried interest” could raise £440m annually from 2,000 people, according to the BBC: taxing earned and unearned income the same<strong> </strong>yields a lot. Charging VAT on private school fees would bring £1.7bn for state schools, where, as promised in last year’s conference speech, Starmer guarantees every child the experience of arts, sports and expeditions. The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, promises universal breakfast and after-school clubs and mental health hubs. Sure Start, I’m told, will be back. There’s a great deal more to come.</p> <p>Labour people want more radicalism now. For us, nothing can be enough. But Starmer’s Labour is far less cautious than in 1997 when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown welded themselves to a crippling two-year fall in spending. The quintessence of life on the left is Labour losing over and over again.

bisexual men were the most likely to keep their sexuality secret in both youth and adult sports, with many saying they feared bullying from teammates and discrimination from coaches and officials.</p>

<p>Former Wellington Firebirds player, Stephen Mather, said Davis told him about his sexuality in 1997, when there were no other outwardly gay men playing first class cricket at that time. <br><br>“There were 80 or 90 men – so that doesn’t make a huge amount of sense on a probability scale,” Mather said in the video. “There was some pretty free thinking people in the cricket circles at that time but there were also some pretty old school attitudes as well.”</p> <p>Homophobic attitudes in sport still very much exist, said Madeleine Chapman, The Spinoff’s editor and producer of the documentary series.</p> <p>“But I do think that [Davis’s story] could potentially be an opening for other athletes to share parts of themselves if they’re comfortable with it,” Chapman said.</p> <p>The responses have so far been very positive, she said. “I think other athletes, particularly young athletes being able to see that sort of honesty and vulnerability be warmly accepted by readers and viewers can only be encouraging.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/02/tony-burke-flags-parliamentary-inquiry-to-consider-overhaul-of-workforce-australia-jobs-program","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia

He has spoken of his mother crying on FaceTime from the other side of the world; his father broke down on radio, telling Mix 102.3 “it’s a form of bullying and harassment, these people get away with it, they destroy people’s lives”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/false-news-kyle-chalmers-rubbishes-reports-of-rift-with-mckeon-simpson\">‘False news’: Kyle Chalmers rubbishes reports of rift with McKeon, Simpson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At its best, sports media can relay the joy of elite competition to the community and shine a light on corruption and abuse within powerful institutions. Sports journalists should never be afraid to ask tough questions. If this saga involved Chalmers disliking questions about poor performances, say, or misconduct within the camp (something hardly foreign to Swimming Australia), there would be no sympathy. Those are questions journalists are entitled to ask – even if the recipient may not like hearing them. But this is not that.</p> <p>There has been an element of goading in the way Chalmers has been interrogated about his personal life, regardless of the impact this is having on his mental health. It may be an enticing narrative to paint the macho, tattooed swimmer as the bad guy – and it no doubt gets plenty of online traffic – but it is actively undermining at least one athlete’s wellbeing.</p> <p>The continued pile-on even after Chalmers went public with his mental health concerns is perhaps the most alarming aspect of all this. It suggests a troubling regression from the positive response to athletes opening up about their challenges in recent years (such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/28/simone-biles-receives-praise-for-prioritising-her-mental-health\">gymnast Simone Biles in Tokyo</a>). The media must do better; with great power comes great responsibility.</p> <p>No-one knows how this ends. Chalmers has threatened to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/commonwealth-games/62368473#:~:text=Australian%20swimmer%20Kyle%20Chalmers%20says,false%20headlines%22%20continue%20to%20circulate.\">quit the sport entirely</a> – which would be a major loss for swimming; he remains one of Australia’s best. In the coming days, once the swimming finishes and attention switches to other events in Birmingham, the media will move on. But there is the possibility of some real wreckage being left behind.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/02/country-diary-the-joy-of-wildlife-walks-is-many-eyes-see-more","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T04:30:42Z","webTitle":"Country diary: The joy of wildlife walks is ‘many eyes see more’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/02/country-diary-the-joy-of-wildlife-walks-is-many-eyes-see-more","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/02/country-diary-the-joy-of-wildlife-walks-is-many-eyes-see-more","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: The joy of wildlife walks is ‘many eyes see more’","trailText":"<strong>Longstone Edge, Derbyshire:</strong> The quarries here have much to offer – ravens, wheatears and woolly thistles – and not much gets past the Buxton Field Club","byline":"Mark Cocker","body":"<p>This ridge is reputed to command the most spectacular views found anywhere in Derbyshire, but it’s also notable for two elongated “trenches” that were excavated from the hilltop in a search for fluorspar.</p> <p>Quarries are usually seen as scars on the landscape, but these sites, known as High Rake and Deep Rake, illustrate the wildlife opportunities inadvertently created by some industrial activities. High Rake has become a cliff site perfect for ravens, wheatears and peregrines, while the stony spoil used to infill Deep Rake has turned it into a superb habitat for flowers and insects.</p> <p>Last weekend, Longstone was host to two Derbyshire specialities at the same time. One was the woolly thistle, a magnificent if heavily armoured plant with massive magenta flowers that orbit about their stem like a constellation of stars. The second party to this rare union was a visit by the Buxton Field Club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ce94672918bf93f468df429d3e6c47c231190759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce94672918bf93f468df429d3e6c47c231190759/0_350_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woolly thistle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woolly thistle. ‘A magnificent if heavily armoured plant with massive magenta flowers.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Cocker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain may be increasingly denuded of wildlife – we’re now the 12th most denatured country on earth – but the rude health of our wildlife societies is indisputable. I doubt there’s a decent-sized town in England that doesn’t have a dedicated group. Buxton’s own was founded in 1946, and nearly 80 years later, the membership is possibly more dynamic than ever.</p> <p>Its summer habit is a slate of field excursions at local hotspots. To an outsider, they may look like anarchic, wending caravans of conversation and humour, but they are founded on two clear principles. The first is the idea that many eyes see more. I calculated our pace at roughly a mile per 100 minutes, because every few moments up went the occasionally esoteric cry of “Peregrine right!”, or “Dark-green fritillary!” (fast-flying tiger-patterned butterfly), or “<em>Chrysotoxum bicinctum</em><em>!</em>” (beautiful wasp-mimicking hoverfly).</p> <p>The other precept was best demonstrated in one wonderful moment when the whole club seemed to be gathered in worship about a single spectacular woolly thistle. To scrutinise the plant in detail was to appreciate how it was an entire ecosystem unto itself, with moths, leafhoppers, spiders, gall-forming flies, butterfly caterpillars, and bumblebees in residence together. As with these creatures, sometimes it is better to share our experience of life with others.</p> <p>• Country Diary is on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en\" title=\"\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/chinese-china-rocket-re-entry-suspected-space-debris-lands-malaysia-indonesia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T04:13:53Z","webTitle":"Chinese rocket re-entry: suspected debris lands in Malaysia and Indonesia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/chinese-china-rocket-re-entry-suspected-space-debris-lands-malaysia-indonesia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/chinese-china-rocket-re-entry-suspected-space-debris-lands-malaysia-indonesia","fields":{"headline":"Chinese rocket re-entry: suspected debris lands in Malaysia and Indonesia","trailText":"Charred ring of metal five metres in diameter found in Kalimantan and smaller piece discovered in Sarawak, Malaysia","byline":"Jordyn Beazley","body":"<p>Debris suspected to be from a Chinese booster rocket that made an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/nasa-criticises-china-after-space-rocket-makes-uncontrolled-return-to-earth\">uncontrolled return to Earth on Saturday</a> has reportedly been found metres from villages in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p> <p>A charred ring of metal about five metres in diameter was found on Sunday in Kalimantan, Indonesia, according to a Malaysian <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiISj1IiYko\">news outlet</a>.

Under the Taliban blueprint, the area will become a tourism centre with restaurants, guesthouses, parking, public toilets and handicraft and grocery shops.</p> <p>But the ruined bazaar is itself a historic site that may sit on top of older ruins, and it is also close to the fragile cliff of Buddhist monastery caves that is one of Afghanistan’s greatest treasures.</p> <p>“This old bazaar is in the archaeological buffer zone of the world heritage site and Unesco [the UN agency that manages the listings] has never been in favour of reusing this place,” said a diplomat with expertise in heritage issues in Afghanistan, who asked to remain anonymous.</p> <p>“On the contrary, these buildings are located in the middle of an archaeological zone, and the buildings themselves are in some way part of the late 19th- and early 20th-century heritage and therefore their reconstruction is sensitive.”</p> <p>In 2001, the Taliban destroyed two giant statues that had towered over the valley for more than a millennium, but the niches where they stood, and surviving cave frescos and other remains still make the site one of global importance.</p> <p>The main road through Bamiyan was re-routed years ago to limit vibrations and fumes from traffic.

The US military has made preparations to protect Pelosi during the visit, while officials scramble to interpret Beijing’s saber-rattling.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30b9551f613c2951f2d6ad081d3910eb1561bf4a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30b9551f613c2951f2d6ad081d3910eb1561bf4a/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pelosi close up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nancy Pelosi holds a news conference last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are also serious domestic risks, as Pelosi’s party faces a difficult re-election in November with her gavel in the balance and Biden desperate to generate positive headlines about his economic agenda – not foreign troubles.</p> \n<p>Republicans are urging Pelosi to go, and ready to accuse Democrats of bowing to Beijing if she doesn’t. The focus on Pelosi’s travel, during the House’s autumn recess, also threatens to distract from a string of Democratic legislative victories at home.</p> \n<p>Biden is preparing to sign a bill that would spend hundreds of billions of dollars designed to give the US a manufacturing and technological edge over China. And a surprise deal with a Democratic holdout revived Biden’s economic agenda, thought to be doomed just weeks ago.</p> \n<p>The last speaker to lead a delegation to Taiwan was the Republican Newt Gingrich in 1997. Appearing on Fox News, Gingrich said he hoped Pelosi would make the trip.</p> \n<p>“Once it’s public, you can’t back down,” Gingrich said. “You have to stand up to the Chinese communists or they will interpret it as a sign of weakness and they’ll grow even more aggressive.”</p> \n<p>At a press conference in July, Biden said that “the military thinks it’s not a good idea right now” for Pelosi to travel. At a White House briefing on Monday, the national security council spokesman, John Kirby, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/china-military-nancy-pelosi-visit-taiwan\">said</a> no one in the administration sought to change her mind about the trip and that the US would ensure she has a “safe and secure” visit should she go through with it. “The speaker makes her own decisions,” he said.</p> \n<p>Pelosi has long been one of the most strident and outspoken critics of China, a position that has in the past allied her with conservatives. She opposed China’s bid to host the summer Olympics in 2008 and has pushed the US to leverage its economic power to improve human rights and labor protections in China. Her advocacy helped ensure oversight of China when it joined the World Trade Organization.</p> \n<p>During a visit to China in 2009, Pelosi hand-delivered a letter to the then president, Hu Jintao, demanding the release of political prisoners.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fa854e2-e1b5-4536-915d-1ee6cc6813ec\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tykhJbhXPKA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“She’s not viewing Taiwan through the lens of what’s happening right now,” said Daniel Silverberg, a former foreign policy adviser to House Democratic leadership. “She’s viewing it through the lens of a 30-year history of activism.”</p> \n<p>Silverberg said Pelosi’s tour of Asian countries was consistent with her view that Congress, as an independent branch of the government, has an important role to play on the world stage. In recent years, Pelosi has emerged as a world leader in her own right, meeting frequently with heads of state to discuss global challenges, the climate crisis chief among them. During the Trump years, her diplomacy took on an even greater prominence as a high-profile counterweight to the former president’s isolationism.</p> \n<p>She recently met with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv and travelled to the Vatican where she met Pope Francis.</p> \n<p>A possible Taiwan visit must “be seen through Pelosi’s view: this is not just symbolism”, Silverberg said. “This is a critical exercise of Congress and concomitantly US foreign policy power and the power of the moral bully pulpit.”</p> \n<p>Pro-democracy advocates eager to see Pelosi visit the island say her long history of standing up to China sends a powerful message at a pivotal moment.</p> \n<p>“The speaker is not only the highest-ranking person who can take this trip, I also think she is the right person to take this trip,” said Samuel Chu, president of the <a href=\"https://hkcampaign.org/\">Campaign for Hong Kong</a>, a Washington-based advocacy group.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb768376a4d564d039c5a98c51c4fdf2aa63ae72\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb768376a4d564d039c5a98c51c4fdf2aa63ae72/0_0_2118_2336/907.jpg\" alt=\"pair grasp hands and walk by flowers\" width=\"907\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dalai Lama and Nancy Pelosi walk after a lunch meeting in Dharamsala, India, in 2008.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gurinder Osan/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chu, whose father is a prominent human rights activist and met with Pelosi when she visited Hong Kong decades ago, said the 1991 trip to Tiananmen Square had been “formative and foundational” to her career.</p> \n<p>Two years after Chinese troops with tanks crushed a pro-democracy demonstration in Tiananmen Square, Pelosi visited the site of the massacre alongside two other members of Congress. Standing in the square, teeming with tourists and international media, they unfurled a black banner that read: “To those who died for democracy in China.” The act surprised security officials and the lawmakers were briefly detained.</p> \n<p>Chu said that was the beginning of decades of advocacy that has shaped her view of US foreign policy, pointing to a version of the line she often repeats when asked about China. “If we don’t speak out against human rights violations in China for commercial reasons,” Pelosi has said, “we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anywhere.”</p> \n<p>Much of her diplomatic leadership has been relational, said Chu. She has forged a close relationship with the Dalai Lama, whom she presented with the Congressional Medal of Honor. In 2019, she drew Beijing’s ire when she welcomed Hong Kong dissidents and was behind the push to confront the atrocities committed against the Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang region, which the US government now officially recognizes as a genocide.</p> \n<p>Chu sees those relationships, built over the arc of her career, as a compelling factor in her decision to visit the island.</p> \n<p>“This has to ultimately be about the aspirations of the Taiwanese people,” Chu said. “And the only way to not cut them out is to be there and to know them and to make that a central part of US-China policymaking.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/02/charities-warn-against-ministers-getting-power-to-stop-early-release-from-jail","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T23:31:01Z","webTitle":"Charities warn against ministers getting powers to stop early release from jail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/02/charities-warn-against-ministers-getting-power-to-stop-early-release-from-jail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/02/charities-warn-against-ministers-getting-power-to-stop-early-release-from-jail","fields":{"headline":"Charities warn against ministers getting powers to stop early release from jail","trailText":"Measure would stop prisoners from being let out automatically part-way through sentences if deemed a threat to public","byline":"Jane Clinton","body":"<p>Charities have warned against new powers that would allow ministers to block the automatic release of dangerous prisoners and potentially make them serve their full sentence.</p> <p>The rule change is part of measures introduced to protect the public and would allow ministers to override judges’ fixed-term sentences that set automatic release dates at halfway or two-thirds through offenders’ jail terms.</p> <p>Instead, ministers will be able to refer offenders to the Parole Board so they can serve out their full prison sentences if they are deemed to have become a “significant public protection concern” and pose “a very high risk of serious harm”, according to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/08/01/dangerous-prisoners-blocked-release-new-minister-powers/\">the Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>It had been thought that the new power would only apply to criminals who were radicalised in jail and who had posed a threat if freed.</p> <p>However, the Ministry of Justice guidance seen by the newspaper “lists more than 180 types of crime that can justify extended detention if the prisoner is thought to pose a risk of committing them after release”.</p> <p>These include robbery, burglary, assault with intent to cause grievous or actual bodily harm, affray, criminal damage, brothel-keeping, carrying a firearm with criminal intent, possessing indecent images, making threats to kill, domestic violence and a number of sexual offences.</p> <p>The MoJ guidance states the new power will cover all forms of risks posed by the offender upon release, whether terrorist, violent or sexual.

They are also worrying about how to meet teacher salary increases with no additional funding from government and spending already cut to the bone.</p> <p>Julia Harnden, a funding specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “It is a very poor reflection on the government’s priorities that it will have presided over a 15-year decline in school funding by the end of this parliament.</p> <p>“While it may argue that there are inflationary pressures beyond its control, the fact is that it is the government itself which has proposed a teachers’ pay award for September without providing any additional funding for schools to afford these costs, and it has also consistently ignored our repeated warnings about the impact of soaring energy costs.”</p> <p>The situation in post-16 education is even worse, Harnden said, citing IFS analysis from last autumn which showed college funding per pupil in 2024-25 10% below 2010-11 levels, while school sixth form funding per pupil will be 23% below.</p> <p>“It is likely that rising cost pressures will exacerbate this desperate situation,” she said. “The government simply must respond by ensuring that schools and colleges have the funding they require to at least maintain provision, and if the government is serious about raising pupil attainment it must provide the resources that are needed to make that ambition achievable.”</p> <p>Sarah Ewins, chief finance and operating officer at the Middlesex Learning Trust, said the schools in her trust had struggled to set balanced budgets for September in the face of rapidly mounting cost pressures including energy costs up by 200%, only for all their planning to be thrown up into the air by the announcement of the teacher pay award on the last day of term which added an extra £95,000 to the expected wage bill of each school.</p> <p>“We fully support paying teachers and support staff properly (especially given years of real terms pay cuts) but we simply cannot do this without additional funding.”</p> <p>The Department for Education said it recognised that schools are facing increased costs due the unprecedented rise in inflation. “To support schools, budgets will rise by £7bn by 2024-25, compared with 2021-22, with the total core school budget increasing to £56.8bn. In the current financial year alone, core school funding is rising by £4bn compared to the previous financial year.”</p> <p>The government’s recent schools white paper set a target that 90% of primary pupils should achieve the expected standard in reading, writing and maths by 2030.

It has been delayed because the government has still not launched the public consultation exercise it needs to hold before licensing such establishments.</p> \n<p>“It was clear throughout our inquiry that some groups are particularly vulnerable to exploitation in this growing market that has gone largely unregulated,” added Hunt. “We need a timetable now for a licensing regime with patient safety at its centre to reduce those risks.”</p> \n<p>People undergoing non-surgical cosmetic procedures should always have to give a full medical and mental health history to the clinic, and have a cooling-off period after the consultation to consider properly whether such treatment is best for them, the MPs said.</p> \n<p>The report warns that: “Body image dissatisfaction and its associated health impacts can affect anyone regardless of gender, sexuality, ethnicity or age.

You have 10 to 15 minutes for a procedure that, from start to finish, should take at least an hour, to really survey the person’s face and understand their reasons for wanting the procedures to be done.”</p> \n<p>The MPs also want the government to order cosmetic treatment providers to clearly mark images used in promotional activities that have been digitally altered, to reduce the risk of clients having unrealistic expectations of how they can change their appearance or of developing an eating disorder.</p> \n<p>Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said that currently local councils can only draw up a list of practitioners in their area who perform tattooing, semi-permanent makeup, piercings, electrolysis and acupuncture.</p> \n<p>“Four out of five of these are considered high risk, due to the fact that they penetrate the skin and can carry a risk of blood-borne virus transmission. Some of these also have a well-documented history of outbreaks of infections, which require hospital treatment and can lead to permanent disfigurement and scarring,” he added.</p> \n<p>“Many practitioners also perform procedures from their home or at the client’s home. Some of these practitioners are likely to have the least training and can be operating under the radar. The risk to vulnerable people is therefore very real and safeguarding issues can arise as, for instance, there is no legal minimum age limit for those wishing to get piercings.”</p> \n<p>Poor hygiene standards, low knowledge of infection control and poorly sterilised equipment are also risks in too many clinics, he added.</p> \n<p>A government spokesperson said: “We will be introducing a national licensing scheme… [which] will build on the existing support we have put in place, from expanding mental health services – including for those with body dysmorphic disorder – with an additional £2.3bn a year by 2024, to changing the law preventing under-18s accessing Botox and filler treatments for cosmetic

position </strong>1st</p> \n<p><strong>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) </strong>13-18</p> \n<h2>Prospects</h2> \n<p>Winning the Champions League is the focus for City, although anything less than top spot domestically will be a disappointment for a team aiming to set higher standards each season.</p> \n<p>Pep Guardiola has shaken things up a bit and acquired something akin to a traditional No 9 in the form of Erling Haaland. He is the man to make the difference in those tight European matches and gives City an option they have lacked since Sergio Agüero was at his best. Winning trophies is what City do nowadays and doing it in style is the only way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6df7ebde-6257-491b-86a6-4625dd0c1954\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KyB4cpjzb2o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the comings and goings, Kevin De Bruyne will still be the focal point of everything in the team and his performances will be critical to City’s chances in all four competitions. The Belgian dragged City to the Premier League title last season and will be hoping for a little more support from his teammates this time around.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s evolution and improvement will keep City on their toes and will ensure there is, at the very least, a two-horse race for the title. City embrace the challenge and there is never any doubting they will rest on laurels, they will be hoping to do better than last season and have the tools to do so. When you are used to dominating, letting up is not an option and the additions of a few new faces should re-energise a team at the top of their sport.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/manchester-city/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>There is not much new to say about Guardiola. He will demand perfection and anything less will leave him furious. A backroom staff shake-up has been required after the departure of assistant Juanma Lillo to Qatari club Al Sadd. The former West Brom midfielder Enzo Maresca left his role as Parma’s head coach to return to City as the Spaniard’s replacement after previously working as the club’s Under-23 head coach. It should bring a few new ideas and a different voice in the dressing room to freshen things up. Guardiola is starting his seventh season in charge at the Etihad, more than many were expecting when he took the job in 2016 and will be desperate to add a fifth Premier League title. He has allowed Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus to leave but he will be optimistic their replacements can surpass their achievements.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7119a821fbcd878f4748408d13ba632696a6c062\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7119a821fbcd878f4748408d13ba632696a6c062/5_184_7316_4748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City new boy Kalvin Phillips and John Stones in pre-season training while Pep Guardiola looks on.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City new boy Kalvin Phillips and John Stones in pre-season training while Pep Guardiola looks on.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Flathers/Manchester City FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>City’s tiny flaws in recent seasons have been clear for all to see: they have lacked a clinical striker. The club thought they were going to miss out on Haaland to Real Madrid partway through last season so will be very pleased to see him at the Etihad. He has suffered a number of injuries in recent times but when he is on the pitch rarely does a game go by without him scoring. The Norway international is only 22 but has plenty of experience in the Champions League and Bundesliga, so City will be confident he can hit the ground running in England.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>It is going to be a quiet month at the Etihad Campus. As with all elite clubs the majority of City’s squad will decamp to the Middle East in hope of being able to return to Manchester with some form of bragging rights. Gareth Southgate will almost certainly call up five City players. That big guy Haaland will be kicking about though and Scott Carson can ensure they can at least put out a team at The Pits in Ardwick once a week. They start back on Boxing Day away to Leeds, who will have enjoyed a more peaceful month off.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:40:45/embed.html\" data-alt=\"f\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:40:45/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>If you are missing football then why not travel to the National Football Museum in the city centre. Afterwards, you can have a gluhwein and novelty-sized bratwurst at one of the plethora of Christmas market stalls to get you in the mood for another World Cup match.</p> \n<h2>Leading the shirt sales</h2> \n<p>It is quite hard to be more popular than Kevin De Bruyne in east Manchester. For seven seasons he has astounded fans with his range of passing, driving runs and ability to rifle shots in with either foot from distance. If he carries on the same vein for another couple of seasons he will join his former teammates by having a statue erected at the Etihad once he departs with a plethora of medals in his rucksack, which he hopes will include a Champions League triumph sooner rather than later.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>Jack Grealish. The England winger always seems to be having fun on his social channels. From grabbing Carson on the Premier League trophy parade after a shandy to going viral for being lovely to fans, Grealish knows what the public want and there is lots of general lighthearted banter from the Brummie. He has racked up millions of followers across the big three socials as his stock rises with the champions on and off the pitch. Who wouldn’t want to see Grealish doing a jig on the Etihad pitch while Louis Theroux raps?

Why we reward it, why we have always venerated it even though it doesn’t fill our bellies, give us warmth or provide shelter. Why we have been mesmerised by storytellers round the fire since time immemorial and remain glued to this day to the painters, sculptors, potters, calligraphers and anyone else who can produce something beautiful from nothing, out of some ineffable alchemy between mind and hand.</p> <p>See too much of this cleverness uninterrupted and you begin to take it for granted. It loses the scarcity value it should always have and becomes commonplace instead of revered. That is why we should be glad a drama like La Brea (Channel 5) exists. This new miniseries launches with a fantastic, in every sense, premise: what if a giant sinkhole opened up in Los Angeles, a shedload of people fell through it, and down there was LA 10,000 years ago? And that’s it. That’s your lot for good things about this programme. After that it’s tremendously, gloriously, educationally bad.</p> <p>To say the plot is by-the-numbers is to slander numbers. We open with two instantly annoying teens, Josh and Izzy Harris (played by Jack Martin and Zyra Gorecki) and their mom, Eve (Natalie Zea, looking roughly three months older than them). They are heading through the city talking about starting a new life after Dad went a bit doolally.</p> <p>Dogs start barking – an unmistakable sign that some special effects are on the way. Sure enough – a sinkhole appears! The family run. They are getting away! But Josh stops to help a little girl who has fallen! The sinkhole gets him! Mom runs back! She falls in too! Izzy grabs on to her! The men in suits lick their pencils and start feverishly ticking off boxes. Mom tells Izzy to let her go, that she loves her and – as she tears herself from her daughter’s grasp: “Run!” Tick, tick, tickety-tick! Them pencils is going to be worn to nubs before the credits roll!</p> <p>We cut to a man outside LA. He has a furrowed brow and pictures of Izzy, Josh and Eve on his phone. He is the dad: Gavin (Eoin Macken), a pilot who has been having visions of a strange, unidentifiable place since a plane crash three years ago. When he learns of the news he sets out to find his family. Alas, there is only Izzy and some fragments of script left. They dash to each other and it is fascinating. It turns out that it is possible to run unconvincingly. “They were right behind me!” she gasps, referring to the rest of the Harris family rather than a swathe of writers or coaches. “Then they were just gone! It was my fault!” God bless the solipsism of the teen who can stand in front of a fathomless sinkhole and make it all about her.</p> <p>Then massive vulture-ish birds start flying out of the hole, which takes everyone’s mind off things for a bit. They look like Ray Harryhausen creations had Ray Harryhausen been no good.</p> <p>Meanwhile, down in the sinkhole, people are acting just as badly with just as woeful a script. Eve has survived, along with one of everything else. Marybeth (Karina Logue) – a hostile cop with a secret sorrow! Ty (Chiké Okonkwo) – a sorrowful shrink with a secret disease!

Furious comments posted on departments’ intranet pages over the past few months have lamented pay and conditions, attracting hundreds of supportive “likes” and discussion about hopes for voluntary redundancy.</p> <p>With a median salary of just over £30,000, civil servants are certainly not immune from the cost of living crisis. But those whose roles centre on diversity and inclusion have been told by Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg that their jobs are a “waste of taxpayers’ money”. And Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss wants to pay less outside London, and reduce annual leave entitlement.</p> <p>Those plans are likely to lead to a further breakdown in spirits among a workforce sick of being the equivalent of a political punch bag.</p> <p>Having been offered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/31/fury-after-civil-service-pay-rises-capped-at-3-amid-surging-inflation\">average pay rise of 2%</a> – well below inflation – civil service unions are considering flexing their muscles. Among those understood to be considering industrial action is the PCS, which will ballot members next month on whether to strike or take other action, such as working to rule.</p> <p>“I know colleagues that have worked here for over 30 years and they have said it’s the worst morale since they joined,” one official told the Guardian. Others felt Truss’s announcement on Monday was clearly the sort of “red meat” designed to whet Conservative members’ appetite for attacking “the blob”.</p> <p>“After years of battling to work with integrity and offer value to the taxpayer, to be told that the people delivering the vital services are the problem is a kick in the teeth,” another civil servant said.</p> <p>With no new fast-streamers entering the civil service in September given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/31/freezing-fast-stream-civil-service-government-whitehall-recruitment\">freeze on the scheme</a> ordered by Boris Johnson, the lack of young new talent is sparking fears of a “brain drain” in the public sector.</p> <p>Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service who went on to advise Labour, said that could be compounded if good people already working in Whitehall and across the country quit.</p> <p>“Most private sector employers are busting a gut to retain and recruit staff – there’s a war for talent. This is about the reverse of what the private sector is doing,” he said.</p> <p>“The key point here is that the vast bulk of civil servants are not in Whitehall at all – they work around the country delivering services: passports, benefits, welfare and pensions, collecting income tax. We already have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/20/more-than-50000-passport-applications-past-10-week-wait-mps-told\">mammoth backlogs</a> – we are becoming backlog Britain – and this will exacerbate that.”</p> <p>The “backlog Britain” warning will be particularly worrying for Conservative politicians who fear they are clinging to power by its coattails and risk being ousted at the next general election for failing to deliver basic public services.</p> <p>Cutting the civil service and failing to plug vacancies caused by an exodus of people enticed by the private sector runs the risk of exacerbating delays in processing passport applications and driving tests.</p> <p>Even asking officials to relocate to jobs outside London may not be the boon Truss predicts. While she wants to dramatically slim down the number of people who get a special London weighting to top up their salary, sources told the Guardian that the Treasury had to incentivise some of those moved to its campus in Darlington by maintaining the weighting for their first two years outside the capital.</p> <p>Of course, one of the greatest dangers for ministers of alienating civil servants is a breakdown in trust. “Ministers seem to be praising in private and kicking us in public,” sighed one.</p> <p>If civil servants feel unable to fight back publicly or through industrial action, they may resort to other tactics such as “go-slows” or other attempts to stymie the progress of policies or other government business, and that would be painful for both ministers and their voters.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/01/liz-truss-plan-to-cut-11bn-in-whitehall-waste-ludicrous","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T21:30:33Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss plan to cut £11bn in Whitehall waste ‘ludicrous’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/liz-truss-plan-to-cut-11bn-in-whitehall-waste-ludicrous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/01/liz-truss-plan-to-cut-11bn-in-whitehall-waste-ludicrous","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss plan to cut £11bn in Whitehall waste ‘ludicrous’","trailText":"Unions and experts attack Tory leadership candidate’s proposals for civil service savings","byline":"Heather Stewart and Aubrey Allegretti","body":"<p>Liz Truss has been accused of making “ludicrous” claims as she vowed to cut civil service salaries and reduce expenditure to recoup £11bn a year in a “war on Whitehall waste” if she becomes prime minister.</p> \n<p>But the Conservative leadership hopeful’s campaign, which received another boost with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/penny-mordaunt-backs-liz-truss-in-contest-to-be-next-tory-leader\">the backing of Penny Mordaunt on Monday</a>, was forced to redo some of its sums within hours of releasing a series of proposals to reduce the cost of the civil service.</p> \n<p>These included paying staff less outside London and cutting annual holiday allowance. Truss also promised to “tackle left-wing groupthink in government” and to scrap diversity and inclusion jobs, saying they “distract from delivering on the British people’s priorities”.</p> \n<p>“As prime minister I will run a leaner, more efficient, more focused Whitehall that prioritises the things that really matter to people and is laser-focused on frontline services,” she said. “There is too much bureaucracy and stale groupthink in Whitehall.” </p> \n<p>Trade unions and policy experts condemned the plans as unworkable and said Truss had dramatically exaggerated the potential savings that she claimed would amount to £11bn a year.</p> \n<p>The most significant element of the plan is the introduction of regional pay boards, which she said would “tailor pay to the cost of living where civil servants actually work”. She claimed this would save up to £8.8bn.</p> \n<p>Experts questioned whether the savings were feasible. Alex Thomas, programme director at the Institute for Government, said: “If you’re just talking about civil servants, that is ludicrous; it doesn’t add up at all. The whole [annual] civil service pay bill is around £9bn.”</p> \n<p>He suggested regional pay boards might be a reasonable plan but would only generate anything like the savings mooted by Truss if applied across the public sector, including the NHS, schools and local government, which would be likely to involve a lengthy bargaining process.</p> \n<p>“It’s not a bad thing for the public sector to be matching its salary scales to the part of the country it’s operating in. But you only get to these sorts of numbers if you’re talking about a doctor or a nurse or a school administrator, who already works outside London, receiving a lower salary,” he said.</p> \n<p>The £8.8bn savings policy echoes a <a href=\"https://assets.nationbuilder.com/taxpayersalliance/pages/17541/attachments/original/1656410661/Regional_pay_bargaining.pdf?1656410661\">report</a> by the Taxpayers’ Alliance published over the weekend, but the paper said it could be achieved by regional pay bargaining for the entire public sector of about 5.7 million people.</p> \n<p>Government statistics <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/civil-service-statistics-2022/statistical-bulletin-civil-service-statistics-2022#:~:text=The%20median%20salary%20is%20%C2%A3,from%2057%2C200%20in%202020%2F21.\">show</a> there are 478,090 civil servants on a median salary of £30,110. Boris Johnson had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/boris-johnson-plans-to-axe-90000-civil-service-jobs-to-fund-tax-cuts\">pledged to cull a fifth of civil service numbers</a>, or about 90,000 jobs.</p> \n<p>Truss’s team claimed that relocating civil servants out of London would save £557m a year by avoiding the need to pay them a special weighting for working in the capital. However, they overestimated the saving by around £400m and were forced to correct it to £153m on Monday afternoon.</p> \n<p>Addressing Truss’s suggestion that civil servants’ salaries outside London can distort the labour market if they are higher than the going rate locally, Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, compared it to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/politicians-condemn-p-and-o-ferries-mass-sacking-staff?utm_term=623429640974c3088f9dc11c738e93fd&amp;utm_campaign=MorningBriefingUK&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=morningbriefinguk_email\">approach of P&amp;O Ferries</a>, which was criticised for driving down staff pay and conditions.</p> \n<p>“Instead of taking a page out of the P&amp;O Ferries playbook, Liz Truss should be focused on ensuring that the civil service has the right people with the right skills to deliver high-quality public services and tackle the challenges the government faces right now, including the recovery from Covid backlogs and the new war on mainland Europe,” he said.</p> \n<p>Other aspects of Truss’s plan include saving £2bn by cutting civil servants’ annual holiday allowance by two days. She also said she would ban civil service trades union representatives from using taxpayer-funded “facility time” to plan strike action.</p> \n<p>Truss’s team said this would save up to £137m a year but unions insist there are already firm restrictions on how facility time can be used. Oliver Dowden, then a Cabinet Office minister, told MPs in 2019 that facility time accounted for 0.06% of the public sector wage bill, and the government was already reducing it.</p> \n<p>Truss also announced that she would halt a proposed ban on “buy one get one free” deals on junk food, in an interview with the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11069973/Liz-Truss-vows-halt-Nanny-State-ban-buy-one-one-free-deals-stop-taxes-unhealthy-food.html\">Daily Mail</a> where she attacked “nanny state levies”.</p> \n<p>Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said Truss was “declaring war on herself with her fantasy recipe for levelling down”. She said that the Conservative government had overseen “epic waste” including during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>“Her ‘tailored’ pay plans would level down the pay of northerners, worsening the divide which already exists. This out-of-touch government’s commitment to levelling up is dead.</p> \n<p>“Now Liz Truss is pledging yet more cuts which will only worsen the backlogs we already have in courts, airports and GPs, leaving people waiting for passports, driving licences, and vital appointments.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"00617cde-c9d2-4fde-93e6-e00d9bff2223\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kiGNYsQdJ3M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In her final message to Tory members as ballots were posted out, Truss vowed to “be bold” and “work relentlessly to deliver on our promises” to win at the next election, which she said would be in 2024.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In a final swipe at Rishi Sunak, her leadership rival, she said: “We cannot continue to have business-as-usual, and I have a bold plan to get our economy back on track.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/01/guy-reffitt-capitol-attack-sentence-three-percenters","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T21:20:08Z","webTitle":"US Capitol attack: militia member gets longest prison sentence yet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/guy-reffitt-capitol-attack-sentence-three-percenters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/guy-reffitt-capitol-attack-sentence-three-percenters","fields":{"headline":"US Capitol attack: militia member gets longest prison sentence yet","trailText":"Man with ties to Three Percenters, who said he planned to violently drag Pelosi from building, sentenced to seven years","byline":"Guardian staff and agencies","body":"<p>An associate of the far-right Three Percenters militia group has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for his role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-capitol-american-carnage-washington\">storming the US Capitol</a> on 6 January 2021.</p> <p>It is the longest sentence imposed so far among hundreds of cases related to the insurrection by extremist supporters of Donald Trump who sought to stop the official congressional certification of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/14/electoral-college-joe-biden-donald-trump-2020-election\">Joe Biden’s election victory</a> over his Republican rival.</p> <p>Prosecutors said Guy Reffitt had told fellow members of the Texas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/09/us-capitol-attackers-violence-rural-west\">Three Percenters militia group</a> that he planned to drag the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">House speaker, Nancy Pelosi</a>, out of the Capitol building by her ankles “with her head hitting every step on the way down”, according to a court filing.</p> <p>Reffitt was sentenced in Washington DC on Monday after being convicted by a jury in March of obstructing Congress’s joint session, of interfering with police officers outside the Capitol and of threatening his two teenage children if they reported him to law enforcement.</p> <p>Justice department prosecutors recommended a 15-year prison sentence for Reffitt, with the duration warranted “for terrorism”.</p> <p>The longest sentence before Reffitt’s 7.25-year term was handed down was five years and three months, for two men who admitted assaulting police officers at the Capitol.</p> <p>Reffitt’s defense had asked for no more than two years in prison.</p> <p>Videos captured the confrontation between outnumbered US Capitol police officers and a mob of people, including Reffitt, who approached them on the west side of the building that afternoon, shortly after Trump had held a rally calling on the crowd to go to the Capitol and urging supporters to “fight like hell” to keep him in power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/26/garland-charge-trump-capitol-attack-jan-6-doj\">Garland promises ‘justice without fear or favor’ as DoJ digs into Trump’s January 6 role</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reffitt was armed with a Smith &amp;

In particular there is discussion over whether the referees overlooked what is being referred to as a “clear case of handball” in the 25th minute of the match. The tabloid Bild, for one, is furious. Under the headline: Anger over the Scandal Referees, the paper writes, it was “clear to see that the England player, Leah Williamson played the ball at shoulder height, with her hand”.</p> <p>It accuses the referee Kateryna Monzul, of failing to view it as a handball, while the video referees, Paolo Valeri and Pol van Bockel, came to the joint conclusion that it was not a punishable move, “So they did not even check the scene!” Bild declares.</p> <p>The tabloid confronted Monzul about her decision after the match, with the question: “What happened in the 25th minute with England’s handball?” Monzul, it said, “shrugged her shoulders and stretched her arms out wide in an apologetic way and left. No explanation.”</p> <p>The tabloid then proceeded to confront Valeri after the end of the match in the mixed zone. His response, it said, was: “<em>Non posso dire niente, mi dispiace</em>” – or “I can’t say anything, I’m sorry”. Bild interprets this more bluntly in German as: “Sorry, I’ve been muzzled.”</p> <p>Later in a widely broadcast media interview, Germany’s trainer, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, was also critical of the decision: “At this level in a final of the European Championships something like this should not happen,” she said. “I would like for there to be a discussion about this. But what I don’t want is that it is overlooked.”</p> <p>In a separate commentary, Bild goes so far as to compare what it calls the “fraudulent” outcome with the Wembley defeat of Germany’s men to England at the 1966 World Cup: “Germany is crying with our football women, and is annoyed about this new Wembley fraud! With this 1:2 defeat after an extension, we have been defrauded again almost 56 years after the scandal around the Wembley goal,” it writes.</p> <p>Spiegel referred to the “commotion which reigned in connection with a handball” which it said might have turned the game in Germany’s favour. It quoted Voss-Tecklenburg as graciously saying that while Germany should have been granted a penalty kick, in her opinion, England was a worthy victor after the 120-minute match. “They played themselves into the hearts of many people,” she said.</p> <p>Die Zeit said it was clear that the match “could have ended differently, had the referee recognised Leah Williamson’s handball in the 25th minute. According to the rulebook it should have led to a penalty kick, maybe even a red card. But neither the referee who is anyway normally rather overwhelmed, nor her video assistants wanted to admit they had seen anything.

He stressed the sport is looking at how to put safeguards in place after being asked whether the Russian-Israeli oligarch, who sold Chelsea to a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital in May, had been a positive influence on English football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-6-chelsea\">Premier League 2022-23 preview No 6: Chelsea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s difficult to say now with hindsight that it’s all been good obviously, given what has transpired over the last six and a half months,” Masters said. “I think if you ask Chelsea fans, they’d give you a different answer. I think the situation we ended with has given the sport some challenges we’ve got to meet.</p> <p>“Ultimately, there wasn’t an owners’ and directors’ test when Abramovich took ownership of Chelsea, and so I suppose the answer to the question is had there been that in place what would have happened and what safeguards we need to build in for the future.”</p> <p>Masters said the procedure needed to be strengthened. “It is a rolling test. Prevention is better than cure, isn’t it? There wasn’t then, there is now, it’s going to change and part of that actually is probably going to be the strengthening of the annual … I wouldn’t call it a MOT, but an annual test.”</p> <p>Chelsea were given a deadline of 31 May for a takeover. The sale took place at a dramatic pace and went close to the wire, with Chelsea facing the prospect of serious financial consequences if the deal with Boehly and Clearlake had collapsed.</p> <p>“Nothing like this has happened before,” Masters said. “There was obviously a genuine concern the sale wouldn’t take place in the timeframe that was available. That didn’t happen thankfully”</p> <p>Masters, who said there were no plans to revive the idea of holding Premier League games abroad, said the majority of the division’s clubs wanted to keep the League Cup in place. However he stressed Uefa’s changes to the Champions League after 2024 would create extra pressure on the competition. He added that discussions over whether to continue staging semi-finals over two legs were ongoing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eff03da63e58d11b398e162cb3a75a5629988d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eff03da63e58d11b398e162cb3a75a5629988d1/0_250_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Masters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Masters insists Premier League clubs still want the League Cup</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I think that now we know what’s happening post-2024, there are going to be discussions between the FA, the Premier League and EFL on how to reform the calendar,” Masters said. </p> <p>“Clearly, I think the biggest impact of the Uefa reforms are on the League Cup because of the loss of midweeks, so we need to find a solution to that. If you talk to Premier League clubs, they want the League Cup to remain, they want it to remain part of the competition, the Wembley slot, the European place. That’s one of the things we’ve got to discuss and that’s got to happen now.”</p> <p>There is a desire to manage the workload on players this season, which begins with Arsenal’s trip to Crystal Palace on Friday. Clubs who play away in the Champions League on a Wednesday will not play in the lunchtime kick-off on the following Saturday. Teams will also not be asked to play twice in the space of 48 hours over the festive period.</p> <p>A multi-ball system will be in place as the league attempts to combat time-wasting after it was shown that the ball was only in play for an average of 55 minutes and seven seconds last season. One ball will be on the pitch, the fourth official will have a spare ball, and there will be a further eight balls stationed around the pitch. It is hoped the system will speed up play.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/aug/01/commonwealth-games-2022-day-four-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T20:36:43Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games 2022: McKeon wins record 12th gold in the pool –as it happened!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/aug/01/commonwealth-games-2022-day-four-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/aug/01/commonwealth-games-2022-day-four-live","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games 2022: McKeon wins record 12th gold in the pool –as it happened!","trailText":"Australia’s Emma McKeon won her 12th gold medal in the pool, a Games record, while in the velodrome, Laura Kenny put a poor season behind her to win gold in the women’s 10km scratch race","byline":"Will Magee, Daniel Harris, Martin Belam and Will Unwin","body":"<div id=\"block-62e839758f08c00147328e50\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T20:38:11.713Z\">9.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Righto, that concludes today’s coverage ... </strong>but join us again in the morning for more Commonwealth joy.

But Green Party candidates still face an ongoing legal battle to appear on the November ballot after the state board’s initial rejection of the petition led the party to miss the 1 July deadline.</p> <p>The elections board’s Democratic majority previously rejected the Green Party petition in a 3-2 vote on 30 June, citing petition sheets with nearly identical handwriting as well as incomplete personal information, duplicate names and deceased signatories.</p> <p>The Green Party sued the board on 14 July, alleging Democratic interference in the petitioning process and asking the court to reverse the board’s decision. </p> <p>The board filed a response to the lawsuit on Friday, opposing the Green Party’s demand that a judge order the board to include its candidates on the ballot. The board agreed the court should extend the candidate filing deadline should the party earn official recognition at Monday’s board meeting, the brief states.</p> <p>Democrats have warned that Green Party certification could <strong>divide progressive voters</strong> and clear a path for Republican victories in key races — particularly the tight US senate race between Democrat<strong> Cheri Beasley</strong> and Trump-endorsed Republican congressman <strong>Ted Budd</strong>. Prior to the board’s initial vote, the <strong>Democratic</strong><strong> senatorial campaign committee </strong>acknowledged contacting signers of the Green Party’s petition to request they remove their names.</p> <p>K Ryan Parker, a plaintiff in the Green Party lawsuit, called the board’s decision “a welcome surprise and a huge win for democracy,” which he believes was prompted by the recent onslaught of media attention and a desire to settle the matter outside federal court.</p> <p>“It doesn’t change the fact that the<strong> Democratic party</strong> attempted to disenfranchise North Carolina voters like me by hiring operatives to call, text and visit voters in their home, attempting to compel them to remove their signatures from the petition,” Parker said in an interview Monday. “And it doesn’t change the fact that this <strong>two-party system</strong>, this duopoly, has failed us at every turn and continues to force voters into a dilemma every four years of voting for a lesser evil.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T18:25:13.613Z\">at 7.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62e804d38f08c00147328cda\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T17:48:21.726Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tomorrow’s a big primary day in a lot of states, and one big race to watch is the <strong>Missouri senate Republican primary</strong>. </p> <p>With Republican senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> retiring, basically everybody and their neighbor has come out to vie for his seat. <strong>Eric Greitens</strong>, the former governor of Missouri, initially held the lead, but he has been dogged by scandal after scandal, with his ex-wife alleging that he abused her and their child and a woman accusing him of sexually and physically abusing her and then threatening to release nude photos of her if she told anyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1554130125763010567\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump posts that he plans to endorse today in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mosen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#mosen</a> ahead of primary tomorrow.

Happy Monday. Let’s see what we have in store today.</p> <p>We start the week off with <strong>Joe</strong> <strong>Biden</strong> in quarantine after <strong>testing positive for Covid-19</strong> again and<strong> the House in recess –</strong> and <strong>Senate Democrats </strong>moving forward with the <strong>Inflation Reduction Act of 2022</strong>, aka, the <strong>reconciliation bill</strong>. </p> <p>This is the<strong> $740bn legislative package </strong>that Senate majority leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> and moderate Democratic senator <strong>Joe Manchin</strong> have agreed upon. The hefty bill seeks to enact deficit reduction to <strong>fight inflation</strong>, lower <strong>energy costs</strong>, <strong>reduce carbon emissions</strong> by roughly 40% by 2030 and <strong>allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices</strong>, among other things. </p> <p>The process of <strong>reconciliation</strong> is essentially a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending and the debt limit with only a majority in the Senate. It’s a way to avoid the threat of a filibuster, a tactic requiring a 60-vote majority that <strong>Senate Republicans</strong> in this particular Congress have used time and time again to stymy the <strong>Biden legislative agenda</strong>. </p> <p>Reconciliation is not without its own difficulties, however. This week, Senate Democrats must meet with the <strong>Senate parliamentarian</strong>, who will parse through the text of the bill to make sure it meets all the rules of what’s allowed within the scope of reconciliation. </p> <p>Politico is also <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/playbook\">reporting </a>that it’s unclear if the Democrats may even have everyone on board when it comes to a majority vote. <strong>Kyrsten Sinema</strong>, the other moderate Democratic senator who has been complicating matters for the <strong>White House</strong>, was purportedly caught unaware by the announcement of the bill. </p> <p>“Kyrsten Sinema is a friend of mine, and we work very close together. She has a tremendous, tremendous input in this legislation,” Manchin said on Meet The Press.</p> <p>More to come. </p> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/02/hard-to-enjoy-kyle-chalmers-wins-gold-as-australian-dominate-commonwealth-games","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T20:15:10Z","webTitle":"‘Hard to enjoy’: Kyle Chalmers wins gold as Glaetzer defies late handlebar change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/hard-to-enjoy-kyle-chalmers-wins-gold-as-australian-dominate-commonwealth-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/02/hard-to-enjoy-kyle-chalmers-wins-gold-as-australian-dominate-commonwealth-games","fields":{"headline":"‘Hard to enjoy’: Kyle Chalmers wins gold as Glaetzer defies late handlebar change","trailText":"The Australian celebrated his 100m freestyle triumph by bringing his finger to his lips and revealing the personal toll of these Games","byline":"Emma Kemp","body":"<p>Kyle Chalmers touched the wall, popped up his head to check the results, then stood up and brought his index finger to his lips.</p> <p>The Australian had just won the men’s 100m freestyle, a Commonwealth Games gold six years in the making – his first at a major international event since becoming Olympic champion at Rio 2016.</p> <p>And after a week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/false-news-kyle-chalmers-rubbishes-reports-of-rift-with-mckeon-simpson\">unfounded speculation and relentless questions</a> about his private life, his time of 47.51 seconds symbolically silenced all the unwelcome attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/australia-urge-uci-safety-improvements-shocking-velodrome-crash-commonwealth-games\">Australia to lead cycling nations in push for improved safety after shocking crash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I thought about it before,” Chalmers told the Seven Network after the race, in which England’s Tom Dean and Scotland’s Duncan Scott won silver and bronze respectively.</p> <p>“Normally I do a bit more of a powerful celebration after a win but that one was one that probably means more than giving a fist bump or flexing the muscles.</p> <p>“It is special to win, but unfortunately I think it is hard to enjoy the moment when all that has happened has gone on.

I would not have been able to get through [without] it.</p> <p>“Yesterday there were points where I thought I would not continue on. That just lets the media win. For me, I had to stand up and do it, not for myself but for everybody at home, everybody going through similar things. I hope I can inspire and I will continue this conversation.”</p> <p>It came as McKeon collected her fourth gold of the Games and the 12th of her career, pipping compatriot Holly Barratt – who tied in second with South Africa’s Erin Gallagher – to build on her new record as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/emma-mckeon-becomes-most-successful-commonwealth-games-athlete-with-11th-gold-medal\">most successful Commonwealth Games athlete</a> in history.</p> <p>Also at the pool, Kaylee McKeown cruised to 200m backstroke victory to add to her 100m triumph, beating Kylie Masse and breaking the Canadian’s Commonwealth Games record in the process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a47d2d2a15f585c6950c0280edf86c240c878ecf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a47d2d2a15f585c6950c0280edf86c240c878ecf/0_0_4839_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Glaetzer celebrates his men’s 1km time trial gold despite racing with sprint handlebars.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Glaetzer celebrates his men’s 1km time trial gold despite racing with sprint handlebars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The men’s relay team won a fourth consecutive 4x200m gold in a Games-record time, and Matthew Levy clinched gold the men’s 50m freestyle S7 to bring down the curtain on an illustrious career featuring a string of Paralympic, world championship and Commonwealth Games gold medals.</p> <p>“It is great to finish here and to back it up from four years ago,” Levy said. “I’ve had a very long career and it is great to continue that high standard throughout 20 years and I’m very proud of tonight and proud of my career.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cody Simpson advanced to the men’s 100m butterfly final, qualifying fifth fastest with a third place in his semi-final.</p> <p>“Pretty wild, pretty special,” Simpson said. “That was my goal, to make sure I got into night. Just relieved that I am.”</p> <p>At the velodrome, Glaetzer put two days of setbacks behind him to defend his 1km time trial from four years ago and equal Anna Meares’s Australian record of five Commonwealth Games cycling golds.</p> <p>Despite being forced to use different handlebars for safety reasons, Glaetzer (59.505 seconds) and fellow Australian Tom Cornish (1:00.036) finished first and second ahead of Trinidad and Tobago’s Nicholas Paul (1:00.089).</p> <p>The race – likely his last at a Commonwealth Games – was a fitting end to a nightmare 48 hours, during which the 29-year-old from Adelaide crashed during the keirin and needed his elbow cut open to remove splinters, and was then denied a bronze medal on review in the men’s sprint.</p> <p>AusCycling had told the Australians they would have to use less aerodynamic sprint handlebars because of fears the aerobars would not stand up to the riders’ power output.

Then, the players burst into Sarina Wiegman’s press conference, danced around the stage, singing Three Lions again, as the goalkeeper Mary Earps and right-back Lucy Bronze swivelled their hips while standing on top of the desk at which the manager was seated.</p> \n<p>They were magical and joyous celebration scenes from players who will struggle to digest what they have achieved, Bronze said, until they are “at home, on the sofa, having a glass of orange juice or cup of tea”. She said: “That will be the moment where you think it’s insane, we’re champions of Europe.”</p> \n<p>After filing through the mixed zone and doing interview after interview the players boarded the team bus back to the Lensbury hotel in Teddington that has become a home from home since the team travelled south after their opening game at Old Trafford. “The whole bus back to the hotel there was partying,” Toone said. “Everyone was everywhere, on tables, chairs, down the alleyway.”</p> \n<p>A group of photographers and fans greeted the team outside the hotel, and they continued their dancing in the courtyard before sliding out of view again. There, the party really got started. In a room decked out with balloons, a large cake, lots of drink, pizzas and canapes – and a dancefloor, with a DJ and band to keep them on their feet – the players were welcomed by their closest family members.</p> \n<p>“It felt unreal,” Toone said when asked about the impact of seeing her family after more than a month apart. “They’ve been on this journey with us and it’s hard, we haven’t been able to celebrate with them after games, so it was worth the wait for that hug after the final whistle.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32d486838e3d33e209cb2402649a9c281b8721cf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d486838e3d33e209cb2402649a9c281b8721cf/0_177_7359_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ella Toone (left), with Alessia Russo, holds the Euro 2022 trophy as they celebrate England’s victory with fans at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ella Toone (left), with Alessia Russo, holds the Euro 2022 trophy as they celebrate England’s victory with fans at Wembley.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bronze said: “There were a lot of tears, there was a lot of heart-to-hearts. I think everybody’s mum and dad, and brothers and sisters and cousins, spoke to every single player in the team. It was like everyone else’s family wanted to thank everyone else on the team for making their daughter’s or sister’s dream come true. It was amazing. It was a brilliant night and I have just as many memories from the night as I do from the game probably.”</p> \n<p>Many families stayed for the duration, but Bronze’s family didn’t last. “We have got two under two,” she said. “They did well! I am not going to lie, my nephew did very well. He kept up with everybody, he got on the dancefloor a little bit until two in the morning and then that was his little two-year-old party done. He thought he had a medal on as he had a lanyard on with a picture of his aunty Lucy on it. He told everyone that was his medal, which is pretty nice.”</p> \n<p>Wiegman struggled to keep up with the party-hard team that, according to the captain, Leah Williamson, “partied more than we’ve played football in the past 24 hours”. Williamson, bucket hat on her head, was greeted on Monday by huge cheers from the crowd in Trafalgar Square, where players masked tired faces and hangovers with sunglasses. “This group, we like to work hard but we like to party harder,” Williamson said.</p> \n<p>Bronze tried to hand Wiegman a beer on Monday morning. “Please don’t, Lucy,” she said the manager had replied. The previous night Wiegman had managed half a beer. “For the first time in my life I enjoyed it, because I really don’t like beer,” she said.</p> \n<p>Bronze hopes Wiegman has the taste now. “We have been winding her up, but it’s something she’ll have to get used to now she’s an honorary Englishwoman. She’ll have to get practising. Hopefully we can have more nights like that, so she’s going to need it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/01/swimming-commonwealth-games-adam-peaty-warns-rivals-after-shock-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T19:49:38Z","webTitle":"‘I’m backed into a corner’: Peaty warns rivals he will fight back after shock loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/swimming-commonwealth-games-adam-peaty-warns-rivals-after-shock-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/01/swimming-commonwealth-games-adam-peaty-warns-rivals-after-shock-loss","fields":{"headline":"‘I’m backed into a corner’: Peaty warns rivals he will fight back after shock loss","trailText":"Adam Peaty has warned his opponents he is a wounded lion ready to bite back in the 50m breaststroke final on Tuesday","byline":"Sean Ingle at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre","body":"<p>Adam Peaty has warned his opponents he is like a wounded lion ready to bite back in the 50m breaststroke final on Tuesday following his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/adam-peaty-in-historic-loss-in-100m-breaststroke-at-commonwealth-games\" title=\"\">shock Commonwealth Games defeat</a> in the 100m on Sunday.</p> <p>The Olympic champion had only had two hours’ sleep on Sunday after finishing fourth behind his England teammate James Wilby – his first defeat over 100m since 2014.

I’m backed into a corner now.</p> <p>“Maybe it’s God’s will to get to this point to have this real low because it is a real low. Obviously, it was a devastating night for me.</p> <p>“I just couldn’t switch off because when you’re in defence mode, you’re asking yourself: ‘What’s gone wrong?’ That’s who I am. I’m always looking to see how I get better. I don’t come here for fourth or silver or bronze. That is why I am not happy.”</p> <p>The Commonwealth Games 50m breaststroke title is the only competition that Peaty has never won. But the 27-year-old was given a reminder that he will not have things all his own way by the Australian Sam Williamson, who qualified fastest overall by winning the second semi-final in 27.01sec.</p> <p>“It will probably be the last attempt at it,” said Peaty. “But I am not bothered. In the grand scheme of things it is about the Olympics in two years’ time. I am four weeks into my programme.”</p> <p>Peaty also admitted that he was undercooked in his first competition since fracturing his foot in May, but said his fighting instinct had made him want to keep coming back. “I haven’t really had a winter block where I’ve reset,” he said. “It’s almost like you get in a car without a destination.</p> <p>“I’ve only been in the water for four weeks, I put way too much expectation on myself. But my coach Mel [Marshall] asked me this morning if I wanted to come back out. And I was like: “I’m a fucking fighter.”</p> <p>Peaty said his teammate James Guy had also helped to put his defeat into perspective. “He said to me: ‘Mate, don’t let swimming define you.’ I’ve still won every single championship. Done all the world records. That hasn’t been taken away from me. I’ve just had one bad day in the office.”</p> <p>However Peaty admitted the spark had not been there for the past two years and would have to do some soul searching before the Paris 2024 Olympics. “It’s just as important in an athlete’s career to have these moments. You think, do I want to be here? Do I love the sport as much as I did? I don’t know. Those questions, I have to address.”</p> <p>Elsewhere in the pool on Monday, Australia’s Kyle Chambers won the big clash of the day as he powered to gold in the men’s 100m freestyle in 47.51sec – beating England’s Tom Dean and Scotland’s Duncan Scott into silver and bronze respectively.</p> <p>Afterwards Chambers, who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/false-news-kyle-chalmers-rubbishes-reports-of-rift-with-mckeon-simpson\" title=\"\">at war with the Australian media</a> over reports about his split from his fellow swimmer Emma McKeown, the five-times Olympic Games gold medallist, put his finger to his lips before splashing the pool hard.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards McKeown was back in the pool, winning her 12th Commonwealth gold and 17th medal overall in the 50m butterfly.

This Euros win will change women’s football for ever | Carrie Dunn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A record-breaking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/england-victory-in-womens-euro-2022-final-draws-record-tv-audience-of-17m\">17 million viewers watched England’s 2-1 victory</a> over Germany, making it the most-watched women’s football game in UK television history and the most-watched TV event of the year. Another 87,192 fans saw them live at Wembley stadium.</p> <p>James Herring, an expert in consumer brands and PR, and co-founder of the agency Taylor Herring, said those figures matter. “If you’re a big brand and you’re thinking of investing millions in sports sponsorship, you need to know there will be a return to your investment from bums in seats and eyes on matches and this tournament has done that … They’ve smashed it. It’s been brilliant,” he said.</p> <p>The squad will reportedly receive a bonus of £55,000 each, totalling £1.3m, for winning the tournament under a deal with the Football Association (FA). This is in addition to a reported £2,000 a match in appearance fees.</p> <p>Brands have already flocked to the squad, with right-back Lucy Bronze striking deals with Pepsi and Visa, for example, but this is expected to be only the start. “I think the sponsorship values for the Lionesses will increase tenfold from what they can expect to be banking from commercial values,” Herring said.</p> <p>He estimates that the team’s sponsorship value will have now gone into the hundreds of millions of pounds, while individual players could expect to net deals worth millions.</p> <p>“The people who have stood out in this tournament will be the first pool of contact for brands; from goal scorers, gamechangers in those key matches, and those who have something about them in their own personality.”</p> <p>Mark Borkowski, a PR consultant and author, agreed that in terms of their authenticity, leading players in the team are worth millions. “The team are very powerful and make no mistake we will be celebrating this as long as we celebrated the 1966 World Cup win,” he said.</p> <p>David Alexander, founder and managing director of the sports PR agency Calacus, said many brands have been slow to support on the whole and will be eager to catch up.</p> <p>“English women’s football has been on a positive trajectory for the past few years, particularly with new sponsorship and broadcasting deals investing significantly in the game,” he said. “Hopefully that will have an impact on endorsements and player contracts that see professional players getting closer to the incomes the men have enjoyed for decades.”</p> <p>For Yvonne Harrison, chief executive of Women in Football, it’s crucial that grassroots teams which sustain women’s football also benefit financially. “We’re not going to get the depth in terms of championship players and super league players without having a growing base at the bottom,” she said.</p> <p>Louise McGing, a spokesperson for AFC Leyton, who in 2021 was a finalist for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Unsung Hero award, agrees. “Brands need to create their own market by investing in the next generation of elite football players at grassroots level,” she said.</p> <p>“This means not being obsessed with ROI [return on investment] and ticket and spectator numbers but thinking of the long game and bigger picture around what this can mean for football, the legacy and their own brand.”</p> <p>Sophia Axelsson, AFC Wimbledon Women’s general manager, added that sustainability of these sponsorship and partnerships across the board is vital to ensuring the sport is as accessible as possible.</p> <p>She said: “To be able to grow women’s football in England, that money can’t stay in the top. There will be a continued lack of diversity and inclusion if the money just stays with those top teams.”</p> <p>The largest financial hurdle is finding affordable places to play and train, Axelsson added. This issue is particularly acute in large cities and urban areas where longstanding men’s team have priority, McGing added, with women’s teams often offered hard-to-reach pitches or time slots at unsociable hours.</p> <p>Harrison is hopeful that change at the top will be felt at the bottom. She said: “The women’s football community seems to be quite unique in that it wants everyone to benefit and everyone to grow. It doesn’t seem like an elitist sports that is for the few.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for individual players with skyrocketing profiles, the women’s game has an opportunity to avoid the pitfalls seen in the men’s game, said Doug Reed, general manager at Player4Player, an organisation founded by ex-internationals and Premier League players to mentor and empower footballers.</p> <p>“We see it in the men’s game.

Though it had a small chance of occurring, given the uncertainties in future emissions and the climate system, cataclysmic scenarios could not be ruled out, they said.</p> <p>“Facing a future of accelerating climate change while blind to worst-case scenarios is naive risk management at best and fatally foolish at worst,” the scientists said, adding that there were “ample reasons” to suspect global heating could result in an apocalyptic disaster.</p> <p>The international team of experts argue the world needs to start preparing for the possibility of the climate endgame. “Analysing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanise action, improve resilience, and inform policy,” they said.</p> <p>Explorations in the 1980s of the nuclear winter that would follow a nuclear war spurred public concern and disarmament efforts, the researchers said. The analysis proposes a research agenda, including what they call the “four horsemen” of the climate endgame: famine, extreme weather, war and disease.</p> <p>They also called for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to produce a special report on the issue. The <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\">IPCC report on the impacts of just 1.5C</a> of heating drove a “groundswell of public concern”, they said.</p> <p>“There are plenty of reasons to believe climate change could become catastrophic, even at modest levels of warming,” said Dr Luke Kemp at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, who led the analysis. “Climate change has played a role in every mass extinction event. It has helped fell empires and shaped history.</p> <p>“Paths to disaster are not limited to the direct impacts of high temperatures, such as extreme weather events. Knock-on effects such as financial crises, conflict and new disease outbreaks could trigger other calamities.”</p> <p>The analysis is published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> and was reviewed by a dozen scientists. It argues that the consequences of global heating beyond 3C have been underexamined, with few quantitative estimates of the total impacts. “We know least about the scenarios that matter most,” Kemp said.</p> <p>A thorough risk assessment would consider how risks spread, interacted and amplified, but had not been attempted, the scientists said. “Yet this is how risk unfolds in the real world,” they said. “For example, a cyclone destroys electrical infrastructure, leaving a population vulnerable to an ensuing deadly heatwave.” The Covid pandemic underlined the need to examine rare but high-impact global risks, they added.</p> <p>Particularly concerning are tipping points, where a small rise in global temperature results in a big change in the climate, such as huge carbon emissions from an Amazon rainforest suffering major droughts and fires. Tipping points could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/03/climate-tipping-points-could-topple-like-dominoes-warn-scientists\">trigger others in a cascade</a> and some remained little studied, they said, such as the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0310-1.pdf?proof=t\">abrupt loss of stratocumulus cloud decks</a> that could cause an additional 8C of global warming.</p> <p>The researchers warn that climate breakdown could exacerbate or trigger other catastrophic risks, such as international wars or infectious disease pandemics, and worsen existing vulnerabilities such as poverty, crop failures and lack of water. The analysis suggests superpowers may one day fight over geoengineering plans to reflect sunlight or the right to emit carbon.</p> <p>“There is a striking overlap between currently vulnerable states and future areas of extreme warming,” the scientists said. “If current political fragility does not improve significantly in the coming decades, then a belt of instability with potentially serious ramifications could occur.”</p> <p>There were further good reasons to be concerned about the potential of a global climate catastrophe, the scientists said: “There are warnings from history. Climate change has played a role in the <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/44322625/The_IPCC_A_Primer_for_Archaeologists\">collapse or transformation of numerous previous societies</a> and in each of the five mass extinction events in Earth’s history.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state\">Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state</a> </p> </aside>  <p>New modelling in the analysis shows that extreme heat – defined as an annual average temperature of more than 29C – could affect 2 billion people by 2070 if carbon emissions continue.</p> <p>“Such temperatures currently affect around 30 million people in the Sahara and Gulf Coast,” said Chi Xu, at Nanjing University in China, who was part of the team. “By 2070, these temperatures and the social and political consequences will directly affect two nuclear powers, and seven maximum containment laboratories housing the most dangerous pathogens.

Achieving all long-term targets set to date would mean 1.7-2.6C of warming.</p> <p>“Even these optimistic assumptions lead to dangerous Earth system trajectories,” the scientists said. Temperatures more than 2C above pre-industrial levels had not been sustained on Earth for more than 2.6m years, they said, far before the rise of human civilisation, which had risen in a “narrow climatic envelope” over the past 10,000 years.</p> <p>“The more we learn about how our planet functions, the greater the reason for concern,” said Prof Johan Rockström, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “We increasingly understand that our planet is a more sophisticated and fragile organism.

Playing for your country was phenomenal, but it couldn’t be a career. I was working on the reception desk at Leyland Motors at the time; I had to save up all my annual leave to be able to play. </p> \n<p>My most treasured memory from that time is travelling to Japan to play. We had to save up for our flights and hotel – relatives were really helpful in lending us money so we could go – but it was so worth it. There was a huge fanbase for us out there; the fans would go wild. Looking back I suppose I felt like a star that week, but you don’t realise it at the time – you’re just enjoying it all. It felt like we had made it. To go abroad to play football was amazing.</p> \n<p>We had to fight tooth and nail because there wasn’t so much interest in what we were doing. Now, I think a lot more people are going to be watching. That’s going to make such a difference.</p> \n<p>I was over the moon watching Sunday’s match at home with my friend from that time, Vanessa McLeod, one of the first women’s referees. I nearly fell off the couch when that first goal went in. It was an incredible game, they have achieved so much – I felt a lot of pride watching them. We celebrated afterwards with a cup of tea and a biscuit.</p> \n<h2>‘We were changing people’s minds’</h2> \n<p><em>Carol Thomas, second England women’s captain. Defender,</em><em> 1974</em><em>-1985</em></p> \n<p>In the 60s, it was frowned on for women and girls to play football, but my whole family encouraged me. I was lucky in Hull – I joined a women’s team, even though the ban on women playing was still on at that time, but I didn’t realise.</p> \n<p>We weren’t allowed to play on grounds that were affiliated to the Football Association so we played on park pitches, which usually meant we got some silly comments from men about swapping shirts, or that women shouldn’t be playing football. You usually found within two or three weeks, they would come back to watch, so even in those days we were changing people’s minds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48965a80c81971e9a189292f5944e9acf86a32b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48965a80c81971e9a189292f5944e9acf86a32b1/0_133_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carol Thomas … ‘It was thought women couldn’t manage 90 minutes so we played 35 minutes each way.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carol Thomas … ‘It was thought women couldn’t manage 90 minutes so we played 35 minutes each way.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Speakman/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We just wanted to be recognised in our own right – we didn’t want to be compared with the men. It would have been nice to have a bit more funding, to make it easier for us. It cost us quite a bit of money to represent our country. We had to pay to get to the airport, or if we were playing in England, we’d have to pay petrol money and train fares to get to the grounds. The kit was used over and over again. For some reason, it was thought women couldn’t manage 90 minutes so we played 35 minutes each way and with a size-four ball.</p> \n<p>We all had jobs. I worked in the offices of Northern Dairies. They were good to me, and gave me time off without losing money, and I didn’t have to use holidays. Before games, we’d meet up on the Friday, have a training session on the Saturday and then play on the Sunday. Then we’d all disappear back home ready for our jobs on Monday morning.</p> \n<p>When I first started, I hadn’t thought about representing England because there wasn’t an England women’s team. The first international game wasn’t played until 1972. Just getting selected to play for your country is a proud thing. To follow a great captain like Sheila Parker was a great honour. </p> \n<p>A few people have asked if I wish I’d been born later. It’s nice to see the success they have got, but I’m also proud of what we did back in the 70s and 80s. I wouldn’t change it.</p> \n<h2>‘It’s another world!’</h2> \n<p><em>Wendy Owen, England centre back, </em><em>1972</em><em>-1977</em></p> \n<p>I’m euphoric. I was still singing “Football’s coming home!” in the shower this morning. I watched the game at home and we were on tenterhooks – I didn’t think we were going to do it. But when we won, my phone started going mad – friends, family and some people I hadn’t heard from in years were all congratulating me. I said: “What are you congratulating me for?” They said: “You were there at the start, you started it all with your team!”</p> \n<p>I played with the first England team in 1972, and for our first match in Scotland I think we had about 3,000 spectators – so to see the crowd at Wembley last night felt groundbreaking for women’s sport, and for women in general. So many of the young girls who watched that are going to think: “I want to play football!” I’m hoping more schools will make it part of the PE curriculum.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68d8f01c1e645461e5fc49c450289f85e24639ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68d8f01c1e645461e5fc49c450289f85e24639ca/0_270_3464_2079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Training for the first match against Scotland in Greenock, 1972.

So it’s fantastic, now, to see the girls getting recognised, getting the coverage, getting the funding. It’s another world, really.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of the tournament, I thought: if we can win at Wembley, in front of a capacity crowd, with the game being shown on BBC One, it will take women’s football into the stratosphere … And today, it’s all over the newspaper front pages – as well the middle pages, as well as the back pages. When we played, we did get some coverage in the press, but it would always be focused on how we looked and we would always be asked: “What does your boyfriend think of you playing football?”</p> \n<p>In a cafe last week, I overheard three blokes on the table next to me talking about the England women’s team: they were chatting about the tactics and techniques, just like they would if they were talking about the men’s teams. That really brought it home for me how far women’s football has come.</p> \n<h2>‘We know what it’s like to put on that shirt’</h2> \n<p><em>Angela Taylor-Banks, England forward, 1999</em><em>-2002</em></p> \n<p>I’m buzzing – I’ve got goosebumps. I was nervous all day and I said to my wife: “I don’t get it, I’m not even playing, but I feel like I am!” When you’re a former player and someone who loves the game, you relive it. You know what it’s like to put on that shirt and sing the national anthem. To get that far, you just want that last final step over the line. When Chloe Kelly scored, we were all jumping around.</p> \n<p>Women’s football has grown wonderfully and this tournament is propelling it even further. It was always there in the background but people would say: “Ah you know, it’s girls playing football.” Now, people are saying: “Wow, girls are <em>really</em> playing <em>really great</em> football.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd5faa5e66d36df7e76259c78523105a4287a5d1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd5faa5e66d36df7e76259c78523105a4287a5d1/48_77_1727_1214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Taylor-Banks, right, in 2001 … ‘I look at the game today and think: “I dreamed of that as a little girl.”\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Taylor-Banks, right, in 2001 … ‘I look at the game today and think: “I dreamed of that as a little girl.”</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I played 18 games for England and, for me, a standout memory was the Euros in 2001. The very first game, we went out and I scored a goal against Russia – I was actually the only English player to score in that tournament. We didn’t go any further than the group stage but that was probably the height of my England career, so I can’t imagine how today’s England team must feel.</p> \n<p>I wasn’t pro when I played; I still had a full-time job and we only trained twice a week – so the fact that these girls can play professionally is a big difference. It’s not just that you get 10 years playing and then you’re done; it can set these players up for a career for life.</p> \n<p>I look at the game today and I think: “I dreamed of that as a little girl.” I never got to play at Wembley and I can never do it now but it must be amazing for young girls today to look at these players and think: “I could be that.”</p> \n<h2>‘It was a match I’ll remember for ever’</h2> \n<p><em>Kerry Davis, England forward, 1982</em><em>-1998</em></p> \n<p>In 1984, I played the Euros semi-final against Denmark. They were the hot favourites, and we were the underdogs – many people thought we wouldn’t be able to beat them. We did: 2-1 in the first leg, at Crewe, then 1-0 in the second, on their own patch. It became a match that I’d remember for ever. (I scored in the first leg, which helped.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"44bc81f50bb51d1eb673c8accdad3ac74e567813\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44bc81f50bb51d1eb673c8accdad3ac74e567813/182_111_1356_2194/618.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry Davis … ‘We were lucky if we got one man and his dog watching.

I really, really hope so. I think grassroots football for girls needs to go forward. The Women’s Super League is strong but we still need a bigger fanbase for women’s football at club level. I’d also like to see a lot more female coaches trained up – it’s so important for progression.</p> \n<p>There’s a different vibe at women’s games; I think it’s more jolly, for want of a better word. You can just enjoy the match instead of shouting abuse at each other. The crowd at Wembley was a real mix of men, women, boys and girls – how it should be – but the atmosphere was brilliant. The fans really got behind the team. My mate Jane was dancing on a chair and fell off at one point.</p> \n<p>You cannot compare how playing for England was for me, compared to how it is now. There’s a massive, massive divide. We were lucky if we got one man and his dog watching. But for us it was still playing football. It was still representing your country. That never changes.</p> \n<p>There’s a long way to go to make football more equal across the men’s and women’s game. Issues like racism and homophobia. If you don’t call it out and highlight it, then it’s not going to improve. You have to have the courage to stand up to it. All sports should be inclusive, it’s as simple as that. </p> \n<h2>‘If I was a bloke, I would have been earning millions!’</h2> \n<p><em>Pauline Cope-Boanas</em><em>, England goalkeeper, </em><em>1995</em><em>-2004</em></p> \n<p>It was very emotional walking to Wembley and seeing all those fans, seeing ex-players that laid the foundations. I never dreamed it would ever progress that much – that you’ve got 87,000 people going to a women’s game. It was just overwhelming. I’m not going to lie, I did cry. I don’t think there’s one female England footballer that isn’t waking up feeling just as proud and emotional as I am this morning.</p> \n<p>It was a slightly bittersweet moment – I’ve wished I was still playing ever since the women’s game went pro. I’d love to have played for Sarina Wiegman, I’d love to have played with this group of players. For me, Mary Earps was the best goalkeeper of the tournament. She’s commanding, she’s got a little bit of flashy arrogance about her, but that’s her right because she can make the saves.</p> \n<p>I know she has chats with David de Gea, the Manchester United goalkeeper, and I know the confidence that gives you because when I was playing for Charlton Athletic, I was lucky to train with Dean Kiely, who was in the Premier League with Charlton. He’d say that if I was a bloke, I would have been earning millions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9bb0312edf2ee6285a5681187ba476fa50fbf9b5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bb0312edf2ee6285a5681187ba476fa50fbf9b5/0_230_2400_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pauline Cope-Boanas … ‘It was very emotional walking to Wembley, all those fans – I never dreamed women’s football would progress so much.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pauline Cope-Boanas … ‘It was very emotional walking to Wembley, all those fans – I never dreamed women’s football would progress so much.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REUTERS/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We went to the World Cup in 1995 in Sweden. There was, like, three men and a dog watching. We had to carry our own kit, rinse it out after games. We just had Ted Copeland, the manager, a physio, doctor and masseur. </p> \n<p>I was working as a receptionist at a bank and I had to take annual leave to go away to play for England. I think towards the end, you got £300 or £400 per trip or something, but that was just an added bonus. I would have played for England for nothing. It’s an honour to play for your country.</p> \n<p>On Sunday evening, people were slowly leaving but we stayed because I needed to soak everything in. I was thinking: “Wow, what have they just done? What have we done?” I just kept looking around going: “We ain’t going nowhere, we’re here to stay.”</p> \n<p><em>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And, hopefully now that’s how it’s perceived to be around the world.”</p> \n<p>“I don’t think they realise what they’ve done, yet,” said Lady Sue Campbell, the director of women’s football at the Football Association (FA). “I think it will take some time for them to realise the legacy they have created here.”</p> \n<p>Ella Toone, who scored England’s first goal in Sunday’s 2-1 victory over Germany, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/england-ella-toone-fans-now-in-love-with-womens-football-euros-wsl-crowds\">appealed to fans</a> who had cheered on the Lionesses this summer to now come and support them at Women’s Super League games.</p> \n<p>“I think a lot of people have fallen in love with women’s football this summer,” she said. “That’s what we set out to do.

Boris Johnson was attending the funeral of former first minister of Northern Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/26/lord-trimble-obituary\">Lord Trimble</a>, then departing for a family holiday on Wednesday, so any reception is unlikely this week.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/no-10-denies-snub-to-lionesses-after-boris-johnson-watches-euros-final-from-chequers\">Questions were raised over why Johnson</a>, unlike his German counterpart, chancellor Olaf Scholz, was not at Wembley to see England’s 2-1 victory over Germany after extra time.</p> \n<p>As Scholz visited the German team in their dressing room, Johnson was many miles away watching on TV at his countryside retreat of Chequers with his family. It was left to the foreign secretary – and leadership candidate – Liz Truss, and the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, to represent the UK government at this glorious moment of England sporting history.</p> \n<p>Asked if Johnson could not be bothered to support the Lionesses from Wembley, his spokesperson said the prime minister had supported the team and watched from home, and that the public “would judge the government on the support it has given to women’s football.”</p> \n<p>“This is a government that has stood steadfast in terms of supporting the women’s game and investing in it,” they added.</p> \n<p>While no extra bank holiday is expected to be created to mark the achievement of the England women’s football team, Downing Street did hint that the squad could be lined up for honours in recognition of their success.</p> \n<p>If these were snubs, the Lionesses seemed not to notice, with the focus and determination so evident on the pitch now being deployed to the serious business of partying.</p> \n<p>On the Trafalgar Square stage, they danced and sang along karaoke-style to River Deep – Mountain High, and Freed from Desire, with its lyrics changed by the rapturous crowd to “Beth Mead’s on fire” in honour of Mead’s Golden Boot award.</p> \n<p>Leah Williamson, the England captain and Arsenal defender, admitted what most suspected when she said: “We’ve partied more than we’ve played football in the last 24 hours.”</p> \n<p>Manchester City’s Chloe Kelly, scorer of the winning goal, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/sports-bra-photo-england-womens-euros-win-chloe-kelly-goal-celebration\">celebratory tearing off of her top to reveal her sports bra</a> has been hailed an iconic and empowering feminist moment, said she had not stopped dancing. “My feet just keep going. Everyone’s absolutely buzzing. We had a good night last night, but some of us were a bit worse for wear this morning.”</p> \n<p>Toone had a congratulatory tweet from the England men’s team captain, Harry Kane. “Yeah, I taught him that,” she told the cheering crowd.</p> \n<p>Even Sarina Wiegman, the Dutch coach and the <a href=\"https://www.90min.com/posts/sarina-wiegman-wins-consecutive-euro-titles-with-two-different-countries?utm_source=RSS\">first to lead two different countries to victory in the Euro finals</a>, allowed herself a little jig on stage.</p> \n<p>The BBC said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/england-victory-in-womens-euro-2022-final-draws-record-tv-audience-of-17m\">17.4 million people watched the final</a>, making it the most watched programme this year, breaking all records for women’s football in the UK and making the team household names.</p> \n<p>The challenge now is to convert this enthusiasm and interest into tangible positives for the women’s game. Along with better opportunities for schoolgirls, the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “We need to make sure there’s commercial opportunities and sponsorship as well.</p> \n<p>“It all snowballs together. So, when we get higher viewership, it means there’s more commercial opportunity for the women in sport, which means they have that greater visibility. And also we should never underestimate the power of events like this, in inspiring future generations, the future sportswomen.”</p> \n<p>The FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said: “I think it will really turbo-charge everything we have been doing in the women’s game.”</p> \n<p>Nev Walters, who was with his three daughters in the Trafalgar Square crowd – his eight-year-old, Tess, propped on his shoulders – said it was important for them to see a team that had achieved so much.</p> \n<p>“I wanted them to see what can be done,” said Walters, who was astonished to learn only days ago that women weren’t allowed to play on FA-associated grounds until 1971. “I wanted them to be able to see something they can aspire to.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/21/liz-truss-v-rishi-sunak-tory-pm-contenders-differ-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T18:22:26Z","webTitle":"Truss v Sunak: how do Tory PM contenders differ on policy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/21/liz-truss-v-rishi-sunak-tory-pm-contenders-differ-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/21/liz-truss-v-rishi-sunak-tory-pm-contenders-differ-policy","fields":{"headline":"Truss v Sunak: how do Tory PM contenders differ on policy?","trailText":"What promises are leadership rivals making in terms of economy, climate, education and levelling up?","byline":"Jamie Grierson and Ben Quinn","body":"<p>Either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak will become the next prime minister after Tory MPs put them into the final round of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2022/jul/18/tory-leadership-election-full-results\">Conservative leadership election</a>. Here we look at how they differ on key areas of policy.</p> \n<h2>Economy</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>has promised “a return to traditional Conservative economic values”, a position seen variously as an appeal to instinctive Tory fiscal prudence, or a desire to return to “austerity economics”. When challenged with claims he was a “high-tax chancellor”, he took aim at other candidates offering “comforting fairytales” rather than face the hard economic reality. He has said he aims to cut taxes but wants to tackle inflation first.</p> \n<p>However, later in the race to Number 10, he promised to scrap VAT on household fuel bills for a year. The handout would be worth £160 for every household.</p> \n<p>Sunak has also promised to lower taxes by 20% by the end of the decade, more specifically that he would cut the basic rate of income tax to 16p if the Conservatives are re-elected in 2024.</p> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>has pledged to reverse the national insurance rate rise, which was designed to fund health and social care. Her economic message has been based on low tax and low regulation, and she told the Spectator she would treat borrowing built up during the pandemic like a war debt to be written off over a long period.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc4c13b8-59b1-493c-a396-1be1b87886a1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9XQEGBqbxa0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Climate</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>would set a new legal target for the UK to be energy independent by 2045 at the latest and has committed to maintaining the government’s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and has assured the Tories’ green wing he would protect the environment.</p> \n<p>Insiders say Sunak was resistant to spending money on climate measures when he ran the Treasury. He has, however, previously spoken out in support of net zero and made the case for a greener economy.</p> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>has committed to maintaining the government’s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, but has said she would suspend green energy levies.</p> \n<p>She is backed by the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who is relatively strong on renewable energy, and another backer, Vicky Ford, says she was very supportive of Cop26.</p> \n<h2>Education</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> supporters Nick Gibb and Damian Hinds, both of whom have served as ministers in the Department for Education, laid out Sunak’s approach to schooling in a column in the Times. The education system will be “focused on excellence and delivering the skills and knowledge needed for the world of tomorrow”, they wrote. He plans to help the best multi-academy trusts to expand, and fulfil a commitment to establish high-quality post-16 specialist free schools outside London and the south-east.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/21/rishi-sunak-would-not-cut-taxes-before-autumn-2023-in-clear-divide-with-liz-truss\">Sunak would not cut taxes before autumn 2023, in clear divide with Truss</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>has bemoaned the quality of the state school she attended, which critics swiftly pointed out occurred under Conservative governments, and has promised to give everyone “the same opportunities” so they are “able to know that the town they are born in has opportunity”.</p> \n<p>Truss has also said that every student who achieves three A* grades at A-level should be offered an admissions interview at either Oxford or Cambridge.</p> \n<h2>Home affairs</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>supports the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/17/home-office-in-fresh-row-with-unhcr-over-rwanda-asylum-policy\">Rwanda removal scheme</a>, though sources have briefed that he opposed it as chancellor over the £120m cost.

Under her plans, a standalone offence to criminalise street harassment would be introduced alongside a national domestic abuse register, which would include coercive and controlling behaviour and financial abuse.</p> \n<h2>Levelling up</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>picked up the endorsement of the Tory Tees valley mayor, Ben Houchen, as well as a host of “red wall” MPs over his levelling up pledges. He has committed to maintaining a cabinet-level secretary of state for levelling up. Houchen said he was encouraged by Sunak’s interest in the levelling up agenda.</p> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>has also committed to continuing the levelling up agenda but added she would do this in a “Conservative way”. Commentators have suggested this means a focus on tax cuts and deregulation, rather than high spending and investment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to&nbsp;First&nbsp;Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The NHS</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>is pledging to create a “vaccines style” taskforce dedicated to tackling NHS backlogs. He plans to eliminate one-year waiting times six months earlier than planned by September 2024, and to get overall numbers falling by next year.</p> \n<p>He is warning of “privatisation by the back door” as a result of people who are spending money they can’t afford to go private due to the size of waiting lists.</p> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>is expected to give more detailed policy announcements on the NHS, but she has said she is “completely committed” to government promises for NHS spending.</p> \n<p>One particular area where she faces questions is how she will find money to pay for and tackle the Covid-related NHS backlog given that she has pledged to reverse the national insurance rise introduced to fund this and other costs.</p> \n<h2>Brexit</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>came out early for Brexit in the run-up to the referendum. He has reportedly backed proposals on the “Northern Ireland protocol” and, as chancellor, promoted “freeports” around Britain as one way of benefiting from Brexit. He has committed to a bonfire of EU laws that are “getting in the way” of British businesses.</p> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>has vowed to review all EU laws retained after Brexit by the end of next year, and to scrap or replace those that are deemed to hinder UK growth.</p> \n<p>Truss was a remainer in the referendum campaign but has since become a keen convert to Brexit. She has led negotiations with Brussels over subsequent disagreements and is pushing new legislation that would unilaterally rewrite Britain’s post-Brexit commitments to the EU over Northern Ireland.</p> \n<h2>Immigration</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, despite having served as chancellor for more than two years, has been scathing of the immigration system – calling it broken and chaotic.</p> \n<p>He has said the UK does not have control over its borders and so pledged to reduce the number of people granted asylum in the UK by changing the definition of who qualifies for it, allow MPs to set an annual cap on the number of refugees accepted each year and pursue further Rwanda-style removal plans with other countries.</p> \n<p>He would also withhold aid from countries that do not receive refused asylum seekers and criminals.</p> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss</strong>’s main pitch is ensuring the removal of some asylum seekers to Rwanda goes ahead, and she has pledged to deliver it by reforming the UK’s relationship with the European convention on human rights. The foreign secretary also wants to increase Border Force capacity by 20%, to increase patrols in the Channel and explore “all possible turnaround tactics”. An overhauled bill of rights would be used to enshrine these in law.</p> \n<h2>Media</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>will proceed with the sale of Channel 4, saying privatisation would help the broadcaster compete with big streaming firms. Plans for privatisation are expected to be ready when parliament returns – under a new prime minister – in the autumn.</p> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>is also believed to support privatisation of Channel 4, although she has yet to publicly make her position clear. The sale of Channel 4 is strongly supported by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who is a vocal Truss supporter.</p> \n<h2>Foreign policy and defence</h2> \n<p>Both candidates have yet to set out any big new foreign policy positions during the campaign, although <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> will be eager to shore up his credentials in this area and emphasise his G7 role brokering a minimum global corporation tax rate.</p> \n<p>Having lived and worked in the US, Sunak is regarded as a committed Atlanticist and Eurosceptic. In terms of defence spending, Sunak has expressed opposition to “arbitrary targets”.</p> \n<p>Before the leadership race, <strong>Liz Truss</strong> set out her vision in May of a more assertive G7, which she wanted to be “more institutionalised” and turned into an “economic Nato” that can defend its members from Chinese economic coercion.</p> \n<p>As foreign secretary, she has been at the forefront of Britain’s more hawkish position on Russia, in comparison with Ukraine’s other western allies. She is promising to spend 3% of GDP on defence.</p> \n<h2>Scotland</h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>has said he would try to make an “emotional argument for the United Kingdom from the heart, as well as the practical argument for it and demonstrating it”.</p> \n<p>He has promised to rule out a second referendum on Scottish independence. However, in 2017 he said it would be “hard” to block a second vote on Scottish independence, and that it should be pushed back until after Brexit.</p> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss</strong>, when asked if she would agree to a request for a second Scottish independence referendum under any circumstances, said this week: “No.”</p> \n<p>She added: “The last referendum in 2014 was described as a once-in-a-generation referendum. We’re now in 2022 – that is not a generation ago.” </p> \n<h2>Strikes</h2> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss</strong> has promised a further crackdown on trade unions, widening restrictions to a significant new number of industries.</p> \n<p>Truss said she would legislate for minimum service levels on critical national infrastructure in the first 30 days of government under her leadership. The pledge would go further than the Tories’ 2019 policy, which promised a minimum service should operate during transport strikes.</p> \n<p>The new law proposed by Truss would restrict teachers, postal workers and the energy sector. Tailored minimum thresholds, including staffing levels, would be determined with each industry.</p> \n<h2>Whitehall</h2> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss</strong> has announced a string of reforms of the civil service, which she claims will cut the “bureaucracy and inefficiency” of Whitehall.</p> \n<p>These reforms include the scrapping of civil service roles that focus on diversity and inclusion, and she will cap the median amount of annual leave public sector workers are entitled to, to 25 days. She also says she will defund the paid time off that public sector trade union officials can take to carry out union duties.</p> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> has not officially announced any policies regarding Whitehall yet, but in December it was reported that as chancellor, he was drawing up plans to cut tens of thousands of Whitehall jobs.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/01/shia-factions-mass-in-the-streets-of-baghdad-raising-fears-of-more-unrest","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T18:09:48Z","webTitle":"Shia factions mass in Baghdad raising fears of more unrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/shia-factions-mass-in-the-streets-of-baghdad-raising-fears-of-more-unrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/01/shia-factions-mass-in-the-streets-of-baghdad-raising-fears-of-more-unrest","fields":{"headline":"Shia factions mass in Baghdad raising fears of more unrest","trailText":"Rallies in support of cleric Moqtada al-Sadr follow occupation of Iraqi parliament amid a political vacuum","byline":"Martin Chulov Middle East correspondent","body":"<p>Protesters from rival Shia blocs have taken to the streets of several Iraqi cities in a show of force that sparked fears of a descent into violence amid a 10-month political standoff about naming a new government.</p> \n<p>The rallies followed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/iraq-protesters-storm-parliament-again-baghdad-iran\">weekend occupation of the Iraqi parliament</a> by supporters of the powerful Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has called for the post-2003 political system in Iraq to be overthrown through popular revolt in perhaps the most serious challenge Iraq has faced since the Islamic State terror group overran Mosul and nearly stormed Baghdad in June 2014.</p> \n<p>Demonstrators from Iran-backed groups, known as the Coordination Framework, joined the fray as concerns grew of spillover violence among the country’s Shia communities and even deeper chaos for a country battered by a series of socio-economic crises.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d4019c7db5ef865d8940f148f5077697b332d8c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d4019c7db5ef865d8940f148f5077697b332d8c/0_294_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Security forces use a water cannon to prevent supporters of the Coordination Framework from entering Baghdad’s high-security Green Zone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Security forces use a water cannon to prevent supporters of the Coordination Framework from entering Baghdad’s high-security Green Zone on 1 August.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The unpredictable Sadr performed strongly in a national election held last October, but ordered his MPs to resign and has recently begun rallying his formidable numbers on the Iraqi streets – posing a mounting threat to the political establishment.</p> \n<p>Iranian-linked groups on the other hand performed poorly in the poll and have since been trying to claw back losses, refusing attempts to name a president, or prime minister and insisting that their influence remains strong in the 329-seat parliament.</p> \n<p>Both sides avoided direct clashes on Monday.

the west as implicit nuclear threats.</p> \n  <p>In a speech on 24 February as he launched the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin pointedly referred to Russia’s nuclear arsenal and warned outside powers that any attempt to interfere would “lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history”.</p> \n  <p>Days later, he ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to be put on high

countries as tensions soar over Moscow’s military intervention in Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>If passed, the bill would expand a 2012 law that prohibited US families from adopting Russian children, AFP reports.</p> \n  <p>At the time the ban provoked an outcry, with Kremlin critics saying it made Russian orphans – many with physical or mental difficulties – the victims of a standoff between Washington and Moscow.</p> \n  <p>The new bill published on the website of parliament’s lower house, the State Duma, proposes extending the ban to citizens of countries “that commit unfriendly actions” against Russia.</p> \n  <p>After the West piled unprecedented sanctions on Moscow following President Vladimir Putin’s decision to send troops to pro-Western Ukraine on February 24, Russia expanded the list of what it calls “unfriendly” countries.</p> \n  <p>They now include the US, Australia, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and all EU member states.</p> \n  <p>The bill has to be approved by both chambers of the Russian parliament and signed into law by Putin.</p> \n  <p>In 2012, Moscow banned the adoption of Russian children by American families to punish Washington over its passing of a law sanctioning Russian officials implicated in the death in jail of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in 2009.</p> \n  <p>Since the law was introduced, the number of Russian children adopted by foreign families has dropped drastically.</p> \n  <p>State news agency TASS said 240 Russian children were adopted abroad in 2019, compared with 2,604 in 2012.</p> \n </div> \n <p

C</strong><strong>ritics say the former Russian leader’s furious tirades are a desperate attempt to retain political relevance.</strong></p> \n  <p>Joe Biden is a “strange grandfather with dementia”. The EU leadership are “lunatics”. Russia will ensure that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> “disappears from the map” in the near future.</p> \n  <p>Welcome to another week as seen through the eyes of Dmitry Medvedev, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/15/dmitry-medvedev-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-robin-to-putins-batman\">Russia’s former president and prime minister</a>, and the deputy head of the country’s security council.</p> \n  <p>Medvedev has been on quite a political journey in recent years. Back in 2008, when he became Russia’s president, he promised modernisation and liberalisation, and frequently spoke of his love for blogging and gadgets. He even visited Silicon Valley and received a new iPhone 4 from Steve Jobs.</p> \n  <p>Now, he is an enthusiastic participant in the macho posturing and genocidal rhetoric that have become the main currency of political discourse in wartime Moscow.</p> \n  <p>“I’m often asked why my Telegram posts are so harsh,” wrote Medvedev recently. “Well, I’ll answer: I hate them. They are bastards and degenerates. They want us, Russia, to die. And while I’m still alive, I will do everything to make them disappear.” He did not specify whether the “they” in question referred to Ukrainians, western politicians, or both.</p> \n  <p>Medvedev’s physical transformation is as extraordinary as his ideological shift: a decade ago he was boyish, nerdy and seemed almost charmingly awkward wearing a suit and conducting the business of state. Now he looks jaded and puffy-faced, his eyes glazed over as he launches tirades against the west.</p> \n  <p>Medvedev’s rebooted persona is an apparent attempt to retain political relevance in a climate that has darkened significantly in the decade since he left the presidency.</p> \n  <p>“He’s trying to save himself from political oblivion by out-Heroding Herod, and consequently posturing as a candidate in a Kremlin Apprentice show,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin.</p> \n  <p>Maria Pevchikh, an associate of the imprisoned Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, interpreted Medvedev’s shift in more personal terms: “When you feel you are a pointless and pathetic person, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/dmitry-medvedev\">Dmitry Medvedev</a>, you try to reinvent yourself from time to time. He could have shaved his head, or gone to the gym … but instead he decided to reinvent himself as a hawk,” she said, in a video discussion devoted to Medvedev’s strange behaviour in May.</p> \n  <p>Read more here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/dmitry-medvedev-journey-liberal-anti-west-hawk-russia\">‘I hate them’: Dmitry Medvedev’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T12:16:10.295Z\">at 1.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e7be078f08730a1f7f5381\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T11:53:23.246Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The EU and Nato on Monday welcomed the departure of the grain shipment from Ukraine as a “first step” towards easing the food crisis caused by the Russian invasion.</p> \n  <p>But an EU spokesperson, Peter Stano, said Brussels still expected the “implementation of the whole deal and resumption of Ukrainian exports to the customers around the world”, Agence France-Press reports.</p> \n  <p>Separately, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said western allies “strongly support the full implementation of the deal to ease the global food crisis caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine”.</p> \n  <p>Earlier the Razoni, a Sierra Leone-registered cargo ship, had left the Ukrainian port of Odesa bound for Lebanon with a vital shipment of 26,000 tonnes of grain.</p> \n  <p>It was the first vessel to leave a Ukrainian port since Moscow and Kyiv signed an agreement brokered by Turkey and the UN to permit food shipments despite the conflict.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to the EU foreign service, Stano accused the Kremlin of blocking the shipments for months and noted that Russia had fired missiles at the port of Odesa a day after the deal was signed.</p> \n  <p>He blamed the food shortages affecting parts of the Middle East and Africa on “the unprovoked Russian aggression on February 24 and the blocking of Ukrainian ports and grain exports”.</p> \n  <p>Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February and have seized or bombarded several ports, some of which Ukrainian defenders have since mined to protect them.</p> \n  <p>Under the deal signed in Istanbul on 22 July, Ukraine is to remove the mines and Russia to lift its blockade, but shipments have been slow to restart and fighting on land continues.</p> \n  <p>In addition, according to Stano, Russia is “destroying the fields in Ukraine, destroying the silos in Ukraine, burning the grain or looting and trying to sell it on behalf of Russia”.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T11:59:34.792Z\">at 12.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e7b3448f08730a1f7f52e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T11:10:06.038Z\">12.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The European Union has sent Ukraine €1bn (£837m) in financial aid to support its budget and help it tackle the financial consequences of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian prime minister said on Monday.</p> \n  <p>Denys Shmyhal wrote on the Telegram messaging app:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The €1bn is a part of a large package of support for Ukraine … totalling €9bn.

Russia has blocked Ukraine’s shipping ports, which has prevented the export of tens of millions of tonnes of grain.

Food. Water. Oil. They create and manufacture these shortages. These aren’t naturally occurring whatsoever.”</p> \n  <p>The “they”, the NCRI said, referred to Jewish people.</p> \n  <p>“There is a significant overlap between QAnon and other anti-vax and online conspiracy communities,” said Alex Goldenberg, the lead intelligence analyst at the NCRI and a research fellow at the Rutgers Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience.</p> \n  <p>“Some of the more colourful food-mandate conspiracies intermingle with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.”</p> \n  <p>Read more here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/anti-vax-qanon-twitter-russia-food-crisis\">Anti-vax Twitter accounts pushing food crisis misinformation, study finds</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T11:22:23.919Z\">at 12.22pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e7a1da8f08af33ff4a4f4d\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T10:07:10.209Z\">11.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary of the day so far …</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni, carrying 26,000 tons of corn, has left the port of Odesa, destined for Lebanon. It is the first such departure since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry. “</strong>Ukraine together with our partners has taken another step today in preventing world hunger,” Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said in a statement on Monday. Kubrakov stressed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> had done “everything” to restore the ports and said the lifting of the blockade would give Ukraine’s economy $1bn in foreign exchange revenue.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Russia agreed to allow grain ships to leave Ukraine and to not attack them, in a deal signed on 22 July in Istanbul. But less than 24 hours later, the veracity of the deal was cast into doubt when Russian forces struck Odesa port. </strong>When questioned by Turkey’s defence minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> at first denied it was involved in the attack. But the next day it issued a statement saying it had struck a Ukrainian vessel carrying western weapons that was in the port. Ukraine’s authorities rejected Russia’s explanation.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Russia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/ukrainian-offensive-forces-russia-to-bolster-troops-in-occupied-south\">moving large numbers of troops to Ukraine’s south</a></strong> <strong>in preparation for a Ukrainian counteroffensive</strong>, according to Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence. “They are increasing their troop numbers, preparing for our counteroffensive [in Ukraine’s south] and perhaps preparing to launch an offensive of their own,” Vadym Skibitsky said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was relocating some of its troops from their positions in the east to the south in order to push towards Kherson’s regional capital as well as the Zaporizhzhia region.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been urged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/volodymyr-zelenskiy-orders-evacuation-of-donetsk-region\">evacuate the frontline eastern Donetsk region</a></strong>, the scene of fierce clashes with the Russian military. More than 50,000 children are still in the region, according to local officials. “They need to be evacuated, you cannot put them in mortal danger in the winter without heating, light, without the ability to keep them warm,” Kyiv’s ministry of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories said in a statement.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Russia claims five people were injured after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/russia-claims-ukraine-drone-attack-black-sea-fleet-headquarters\">Ukrainian drone strike on its Black Sea fleet</a> headquarters</strong>, prompting officials to cancel festivities planned for Navy Day. “Early this morning, [Ukraine] decided to spoil our Navy Day,” said Mikhail Razvozhayev, the head of the local Russian administration in Sevastopol in Crimea. “An unidentified object flew into the yard of the fleet headquarters. According to preliminary data, it was a drone. Five people were injured.”</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Russian strikes hit the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv</strong> early on Sunday, wounding three people and damaging homes and schools, according to the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. Zelenskiy described the strikes as “probably the most brutal” on the city and region of the entire war.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Russian shelling on Mykolaiv reportedly killed one of Ukraine’s wealthiest men, Oleksiy Vadatursky, and his wife, Raisa</strong>. Vadatursky headed the grain production and export business Nibulon, which included a fleet of ships for sending grain abroad. A presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Vadatursky was specifically targeted and his death was “not an accident, but a well thought out and organised premeditated murder”.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p><em>That is it from me, Martin Belam for now.

As a result, cases such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/25/charlie-gard-parents-spend-last-precious-moments-with-critically-ill-son\">Charlie Gard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/mar/29/alfie-evans-about-to-be-murdered-says-father-after-court-defeat\">Alfie Evans</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/10/isaiah-haastrup-father-banned-kings-college-hospital-treating-brain-damaged-son-court-told\">Isaiah Haastrup</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/oct/03/seriously-ill-girl-tafida-raqeeb-italy-treatment-high-court-rules\">Tafida Raqeeb</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/19/alta-fixsler-toddler-at-centre-of-parents-legal-battle-dies-in-hospice\">Alta Fixler</a> have struck a chord with the public.</p> <p>Tafida’s was the only one with a seemingly happy ending. A judge disagreed with doctors at the Royal London hospital and allowed the brain-damaged girl – unlike Archie she was not deemed to be brain-stem dead – to travel to Italy for treatment, where she recovered sufficiently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/british-girl-who-won-life-support-legal-battle-is-out-of-intensive-care\">to be removed from intensive care</a>.</p> <p>Hers and other cases, which remain rare, end up in court because there has been a disagreement between doctors and parents about whether to continue treatment. In those circumstances either party – in the Gard case, it was Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS trust – can apply for the court to adjudicate.</p> <p>The emotions generated by such cases have often led to legal proceedings happening in a highly charged atmosphere. Upsetting allegations and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/22/great-ormond-street-staff-receive-death-threats-over-charlie-gard#:~:text=The%20family%20of%20Charlie%20Gard,been%20directed%20at%20GOSH%20staff.\">even threats</a> have been levelled at doctors and nurses by parties not involved in proceedings.</p> <p>It is therefore no surprise that according to Lady Finlay, a crossbench peer and professor of palliative medicine, the government is said to be considering an inquiry into different ways of handling such cases, for example independent mediation.</p> <p>She told Times Radio on Monday: “I’m hoping that by the end of the summer we’ll have an inquiry into different ways of handling these very, very difficult cases so that there is independent mediation.</p> <p>“And I say independent because, if it’s supplied by the hospital, or it’s supplied by the parents, one side may feel mistrustful of the other. But to be in the situation of adversarial conflict doesn’t help anybody.”</p> <p>She added that “where lawyers get involved, things escalate, and it gets harder and harder to communicate between the doctor and the parents as to what’s happening”.</p> <p>Mediation sounds sensible but it requires sign-on from all involved and that may be easier said than done. For parents it can seem like a simple but horrific binary choice: their child either lives or dies. Additionally, recent years have brought increasing intervention by religious groups purporting to support parents but who have also been accused of inflaming tensions.</p> <p>In Charlie’s case, the US pastor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/10/patrick-mahoney-us-pastor-campaigning-for-charlie-gard-has-history-of-publicity-stunts\">Rev Patrick Mahoney</a>, a fervent anti-abortion campaigner and former national spokesperson for Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group with links to violence at clinics and against abortion providers, flew to London to act as self-appointed spokesperson for the parents.</p> <p>Archie’s parents have been supported by the Christian Legal Centre, who were also involved in Alfie’s case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/28/call-from-god-american-pro-lifers-role-in-alfie-evans-battle\">in which Mr Justice Hayden described Pavel Stroilov</a>, the centre law student representing Alfie’s parents, as a “fanatical and deluded young man” whose submissions to the court were “littered with vituperation and bile” that was “inconsistent with the real interests of the parents’ case”.</p> <p>Stroilov was behind the attempt by Alfie’s parents to pursue a private prosecution for murder against three Alder Hey doctors. Archie’s mother has referred to the withdrawal of life support as a “choreographed execution”. Bruno Quintavalle, a barrister who has been involved in Alfie’s and Archie’s cases, was a leader of anti-abortion group ProLife Alliance and previously brought a case in his own name <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2001/918.html\">challenging cell cloning</a>.</p> <p>The involvement of such third-party ideologues presents a significant obstacle to the laudable aim of resolving such sensitive cases in a less adversarial manner.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 2 August 2022.

Sources close to the Labour leader said the matter had not been resolved and shadow cabinet minsters were furious.</p> <p>Multiple shadow ministers said the policy to ban frontbenchers from picket lines had now “effectively broken down” since the shadow transport minister Sam Tarry was sacked for conducting multiple broadcast interviews from a rail workers’ picket on Wednesday.</p> <p>Nandy, who is the shadow levelling up secretary, informed Starmer’s office in advance of her intention to speak to workers from the Communications Workers Union but the Guardian understands that the leader’s office were blindsided by the pictures of her at the picket line. Both sides dispute what was agreed.</p> <p>Shadow cabinet ministers have said Angela Rayner, the deputy leader and a former senior union official, had told allies she was uncomfortable with the policy but was prepared to stick to the party line. “She can be very disciplined so you can imagine what this looks like to her now,” one senior party source said.</p> <p>Rayner met union officials alongside the shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, in a Zoom meeting on Monday, a thinly veiled demonstration of the approved way to engage.</p> <p>One shadow cabinet minister said they were astounded by Nandy’s visit to the picket, especially given the awkward position Rayner was in. “The policy should always have been: we don’t want you picketing, but of course you can speak to them,” they said. “That is obviously what the real policy is. But the fact this was a stupid policy does not excuse Lisa from throwing everyone under the bus.”</p> <p>The shadow minister said they were now deeply worried about party discipline and the potential for a row with the unions to overshadow the party conference, saying: “I would not underestimate how dangerous this is.”</p> <p>A second shadow cabinet source said they were extremely concerned about the breakdown of discipline. “There’s going to be a whole summer of this.”</p> <p>Momentum, the grassroots leftwing group, said it would coordinate with local parties to bring motions to conference backed by unions that supports striking workers – in part an effort to embarrass Starmer.</p> <p>Many shadow ministers – most not on the left of the party – said they had long resented the policy. One said those who had attended picket lines at the last strike had got the “full hairdryer treatment” from a senior aide in Starmer’s office and been given dark ultimatums about attending again.</p> <p>“Unhappiness on this is very widespread on the frontbench,” the shadow minister said. “It is not just on the left. Unions are where most people on the front bench have come from – or [they have] worked in unionised industries.”</p> <p>A third shadow minister said Starmer’s advisers “did not get it” and said they had failed to register the widespread public support for fair pay. “This is not an ideological battle with hardliners – it’s not 1996,” they said. “This is working-class people being driven to food banks by inflation and bosses getting bigger pay packets than ever.”</p> <p>Allies of Nandy have made it clear they did not seek “permission” from Starmer’s office to attend, but informed them in advance.</p> <p>“It’s a local dispute involving constituents but she let them know given the inevitable questions it would raise,” a source close to Nandy said. “She went down to show her support for constituents campaigning for better pay and conditions at a really tough time.”</p> <p>Two other frontbenchers also visited CWU pickets: the shadow employment minister, Imran Hussain, in Bradford and the Labour whip Navendu Mishra in Stockport. Both are expected to be spoken to but not sacked.</p> <p>Starmer has previously told shadow frontbenchers they should not join picket lines. “The Labour party in opposition needs to be the Labour party in power and a government doesn’t go on picket lines,” he said last week.</p> <p>Tarry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/sam-tarry-sacked-shadow-minister-calls-for-labour-show-solidarity-strikes\">was sacked as a shadow transport minister by Starmer</a> last week for giving multiple interviews on a picket line at Euston in London with striking RMT workers – where he suggested they deserved pay rises in line with inflation, a policy not agreed by the Labour frontbench.</p> <p>Tarry said it was “great to see” Nandy joining the picket line. “Senior Labour politicians need to demonstrate loud and clear that our party is on the side of ordinary working people who are fighting back against this anti-worker government,” he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamTarry/status/1554056995904405504?s=20&amp;t=g89BM0oMrBoWQPBZnl00Ug\">tweeted</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unions had expressed fury at Tarry’s sacking and Starmer’s stance.

The parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws with respect to the composition, functions, powers and procedures of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander

an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice?</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>What does the Coalition say?</h2> \n<p>The opposition spokesperson on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/indigenous-australians\">Indigenous Australians</a>, Julian Leeser, said he supported the move to enshrine a voice in the constitution but wanted to see the detail of the question and the proposed reforms.</p> \n<p>“We as a Coalition have an open mind about the issue of the voice that the government is putting forward, and we are awaiting the detail,” he said.</p> \n<p>“This is a step today on that road, but we still want to know how the voice itself is going to operate.”</p> \n<p>The Country Liberal senator, Jacinta Price, a Warlpiri woman, has been more strident, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/29/independents-diversity-and-climate-highlights-of-new-mps-first-speeches-to-australian-parliament\">arguing in her first speech</a> the government is “yet to demonstrate how this proposed voice will deliver practical outcomes and unite, rather than drive a wedge further between, Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia”.</p> \n<h2>What detail already exists about the voice?</h2> \n<p>In July 2021, the Indigenous Voice Co-design Process, co-chaired Marcia Langton and Tom Calma, <a

also been the subject of two joint select committees in parliament, including one co-chaired by Leeser and Labor’s Patrick Dodson.</p> \n<h2>When will the referendum happen?</h2> \n<p>The Albanese government has committed to take the voice proposal to a referendum in this term of parliament, which <a

federal election</a> calling for the voice referendum to occur on 27 January 2024, the “day after Invasion day/Australia day”, or 27 May 2023.</p> \n<p>The latter date is the 56th anniversary of the successful 1967 referendum, which allowed<strong> </strong>the commonwealth to make laws for Indigenous people and count them in the census, and also the sixth anniversary of the Uluru statement.</p> \n<h2>What happens now?</h2> \n<p>Since the parliament would have the power to set the “composition, functions, powers and procedures” of the voice, the question now is: what level of detail will the Albanese government give about these before the referendum?</p> \n<p>On Friday, Langton said the structure of the voice had been “investigated to the point where there is nothing more we can say”.</p> \n<p>She told Radio National:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>When people say they want more detail, all that tells me is they refuse to read our report – because all that detail is there … I see this demand for more detail as mischief-making and sowing confusion … We couldn’t have been more clear than we have been … What we’ve set out in our report for a voice is very straightforward and clear, and is the preferred option of most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.”</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>On Sunday Albanese said the government won’t “go down the cul-de-sac of getting into every detail … because that is not a recipe for success”. On Monday, he told The Project “of course [voters] will know how it works” before the referendum.</p> \n<p>The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, indicated the body would be “representative” but more consultations would be needed about “the way in which a voice would be constituted”.</p> \n<p>“I want to make sure that there is involvement and discussion not only with Indigenous leaders, not only across the parliament, but importantly with the Australian public, about what we should do going forward. It is not about the ‘what’ yet … it is about the ‘why’,” she told the ABC.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/01/sole-parents-like-myself-are-facing-homelessness-its-time-our-pm-realised-this-is-not-the-australia-he-grew-up-in","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T17:30:30Z","webTitle":"Sole parents like myself are facing homelessness.

The additional coronavirus supplement went some way to alleviating poverty and buffering the burden of the increasingly high cost of living, but that ended in March 2021.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Discover the Australia Weekend app\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>I have tried to contact the prime minister before and after he was elected to put forward viable options to help sole parent families in my situation, but I have only ever received a stock-standard email reply and never any follow-up.

Her protagonist, Lucy Lam, is both 15 and 35 in this version: we see her as a teenager in the 1990s as she navigates her eponymous private school, where an elite group, The Cabinet, reigns supreme. Always present is Lucy’s friend Linh, the only person who really gets her.</p> <p>But we also see Lucy looking back, exploring all the ways in which being a member of the Asian diaspora in Australia, and experiencing casual and explicit racism, has irrevocably shaped and changed her. There is both light – the daggy joys of 90s music, an energetic cast – and darkness in this adaptation; it’s a little bit Mean Girls and a little bit Fight Club, with a distinctly Asian-Australian feel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7kVkztZEO8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y7kVkztZEO8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Nguyen remembers being a child in 1996 when Pauline Hanson made her infamous maiden speech in which she claimed that Australia was being “swamped by Asians”.

She tore through the novel in 24 hours; as a Greek-Australian, she could relate to some of the feelings it described. Kalive was keen to adapt it, and when it came to a co-writer, Nguyen immediately came to mind. “I thought there was a fabulous humour in the work and lived experience that Diana would be able to speak to and understand intrinsically,” she says.</p> <p>The intersection of class and race is a recurring topic in Pung’s work, which the author feels Kalive and Nguyen inherently understand. “They have the insight that some people don’t have if they don’t live, or don’t have parents or family, who come from a very working class background, and then are thrust into this world of privilege,” says Pung.</p> <p>Nguyen had read Laurinda years ago. “I was quite triggered by it,” she says. “It’s not overt racism but subtle racism, and I felt Alice did such a great job of naming what Lucy went through. When I think about the courage of any young person who has ever faced racism, that’s what we’ve created – an enduring play about a woman who lives it through school, but it travels with her through her life.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The gift I’m giving to myself is to hear my home language spoken on stage</p> <footer> <cite>Diana Nguyen, co-writer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The comedian, who created the web series Phi and Me about a Vietnamese teenager and her overbearing mother, brings this same understanding of intergenerational dynamics to Laurinda. Scenes with Lucy’s refugee parents are spoken in untranslated Vietnamese – an authentic depiction of the domestic lives of immigrants.</p> <p>“What’s so beautiful about this show, and the grounding parts, are the conversations Lucy has with her mum,” Nguyen says. “For me, to hear the Vietnamese language on stage is mind-blowing. The gift I’m giving to myself is to hear my home language spoken on stage.”</p> <p>“Diana has always been really invested in realising the home as three-dimensionally as possible to really ground Lucy as a fully rounded person, not just a caricature,” Kalive adds.</p> <p>Both writers didn’t have the language as teenagers to describe or understand their experiences with racism or xenophobia; words and concepts such as “microaggression” simply didn’t exist in the everyday lexicon. “As a young person, you’re just trying to exist in the world and all your energy is spent trying to deal,” Kalive says. “I definitely don’t feel like my peers were equipped with the nous that young people are now.”</p> <p>The production’s all-Asian cast of seven includes Fiona Choi (The Family Law), Gemma Chua-Tran (Heartbreak High) and Ngoc Phan (Boy Swallows Universe). Between them, they play 20 characters, not all of whom are Asian; it’s a bold and significant casting choice in an industry that still struggles with meaningful representation. The personal experiences of the actors also informs what unfolds on stage. “The script continues to respond and adapt to include their perspectives, which is incredibly powerful,” Kalive says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/07/looking-for-alibrandi-at-30-theres-a-white-hot-shame-about-sticking-out\">Looking For Alibrandi at 30: ‘There’s a white-hot shame about sticking out’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There’s a brief nod in the play to another 1990s-set Australian YA novel also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/15/looking-for-alibrandi-review-a-moving-stage-show-of-a-beloved-novel\">recently adapted for stage</a>: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/07/looking-for-alibrandi-at-30-theres-a-white-hot-shame-about-sticking-out\">Looking for Alibrandi</a>, which tells a similar story of a teenage girl from a migrant background struggling to find her place in a world of whiteness and privilege.

Scott Morrison and then treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that cut would end in September because continuing that measure in perpetuity was not fiscally responsible.</p> \n<p>But Dutton abruptly switched positions this week, asking the government whether or not it planned to “compound the pressure on household budgets by not extending the fuel excise relief?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was accompanied by questions about whether or not the government stood by pre-election modelling of its climate policy that pointed to cheaper power prices during the transition to renewables.</p> \n<p>Anthony Albanese accused Dutton of hypocrisy. “I point to the fact that [Dutton] was in the cabinet that put together the budget,” the prime minister said.</p> \n<p>“It had the end date for the measure he talks about”.</p> \n<p>The government also blasted the Coalition for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/coalition-delayed-news-that-electricity-prices-are-set-to-rise-until-after-federal-election\">delaying an important electricity pricing update until after the election</a>, which left Australian voters in the dark about looming increases in their power bills.</p> \n<p>Thus far, Labor has signalled it will end the fuel excise cut in September as scheduled.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/02/australias-official-interest-rates-expected-to-rise-by-half-percentage-point-economists-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T17:30:29Z","webTitle":"Australia’s official interest rates expected to rise by half-percentage point, economists say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/02/australias-official-interest-rates-expected-to-rise-by-half-percentage-point-economists-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/02/australias-official-interest-rates-expected-to-rise-by-half-percentage-point-economists-say","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s official interest rates expected to rise by half-percentage point, economists say","trailText":"Experts predict RBA interest rate decision today will lift cash rate to 1.85%, marking a 175-basis point increase since May","byline":"Peter Hannam","body":"<p>Australia’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/interest-rates-australia\">official interest rates</a> are all but certain to be lifted on Tuesday with the expected half-percentage point increase marking the Reserve Bank’s sharpest tightening phase since 1994.</p> \n<p>A survey by Bloomberg News found 28 of 30 respondents predict the RBA board will lift the cash rate from 1.35% to 1.85% at its monthly meeting.

The shop had the classic, musty smell of vintage from a certain era that, for me, always conjures up memories of playing dress-ups with my sister when we were very small. Tulle tutus, Glomesh handbags and our grandmother’s fur stole were on high rotation.</p> <p>Thanks to its natural properties, leather is strong, water repellent and repairable, which means it can last for decades. “Leather is one of those materials that is often misunderstood – both easier and trickier to look after than people think,” says designer Christopher Esber. “It is a naturally durable material, but never without its quirks. Look after it and it will look after you.”</p> <h2>Balm and buff</h2> <p>The founders of British bag brand LPOL, Katy and John Maskell-Bell, say to keep your leather garment clean and in the best condition, you should apply a high-quality natural leather balm or cream every few weeks. “This will ensure your item will last for many more years, extending its life so you can enjoy more wear.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/26/comfort-style-or-function-dressing-four-different-bodies\">Comfort, style, or function? Dressing four different bodies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before you do this, use a damp cloth to clean the surface of the item and leave it for a few minutes to dry. Then, apply the balm using a soft dry cloth and circular motions over all surfaces. Let it soak in for twenty minutes, then using a clean part of the cloth, remove any remaining residue and buff the leather to give it a discreet shine.</p> <h2>Choosing treatments</h2> <p>Since there are many different types of leather, from patent to suede, it’s important to use the right product for your garment. The team behind Farfetch’s repair service, the Restory, recommend applying <a href=\"https://www.birdsall-leather.com.au/DFCCw/Carnauba-Creme/pd.php\">Carnauba cream</a> to smooth leather, and using a spray for other types of leathers like suede or nubuck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16d20c09af1d4c44d6a22b3296bd69614f8e5035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16d20c09af1d4c44d6a22b3296bd69614f8e5035/0_1962_3648_3510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For tan and brown leather, like this jacket worn by Xiayan Guo at Milan fashion week, use a neutral balm to condition, then wipe off any excess.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"962\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For tan and brown leather, like this jacket worn by Xiayan Guo at Milan fashion week, use a neutral balm to condition, then wipe off any excess.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the Maskell-Bells, you can also select a conditioner based on the colour of your leather item. For black leather they suggest a natural black balm; for tan and brown leather they suggest a neutral one. “We also recommend waxing the edges and stitching on your leather garment to keep them resistant to water.”</p> <p>If you’re not sure, or if the item is particularly precious, Esber says to leave moisturising or replenishing creams to the professionals. Most shoe and handbag repair services will also take care of leather clothes, and you can ask them for advice on home care for the future.</p> <h2>What about washing?</h2> <p>Esber recommends removing superficial stains or dirt with a colourfast, slightly damp cloth and avoiding hard cleaners or detergents. When in doubt, he says, “trust the experts. Look for specialist laundries that handle leather apparel”. According to the Restory, leather should never be machine washed. Instead, wash the exterior of your leather item by hand, using soft detergents to spot clean the garment.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/saved-for-later\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Saved for Later\" data-form-description=\"Weekly lifestyle and culture picks from Guardian Australia\" data-form-campaign-code=\"UK_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Get a week’s worth of must-reads, trends and pop-culture in your inbox\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you’ve noticed the lining of your item has started to smell, you can wash it with water and detergent, but you need to be careful not to get the leather wet. To do this, start by turning the garment inside out. Next, the Maskell-Bells recommend you “use a damp cloth with a little pea-sized dot of natural fabric conditioner and lightly scrub in circular motions to remove any dirt, stains or odours”. Finally, leave the garment to dry naturally, ideally outside in the shade, or somewhere well ventilated.</p> <h2>Storage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5d5e5b2380bd7e46b5d19226cd1d0e761d3e086\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5d5e5b2380bd7e46b5d19226cd1d0e761d3e086/0_100_3910_2346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Padded coat hangers: the ideal leather storage solution to avoid damaging its patina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Padded coat hangers: the ideal leather storage solution to avoid damaging its patina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Esber, leather garments should never be stored folded, as this can damage the patina and result in early ageing. Instead, place leather garments on padded coat hangers and keep them in a dry space.</p> <p>If you live in a particularly humid environment, Esber says, storage is key. “Make sure where it is kept leaves air to circulate. You should also keep it in a place where there is daylight without direct sunlight.” Alternatively, make sure you take your leather out for some air every so often.</p> <h2>Managing mould</h2> <p>Unfortunately, humid environments can cause leather items to develop mould. The Restory says if this happens, “it’s important to isolate the item from the rest of your wardrobe to prevent mould spreading”.</p> <p>They recommend placing it in a plastic bag and sending it to be professionally cleaned. Before putting the item back in your wardrobe, you need to monitor it for an extended period to ensure the mould doesn’t come back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b01445771b9555a1f6fc54ed3f55a449ed6078e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b01445771b9555a1f6fc54ed3f55a449ed6078e/0_0_3986_2393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spot it before it spreads: if you see mould on a leather garment, isolate it from the rest of your wardrobe and get it professionally cleaned.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spot it before it spreads: if you see mould on a leather garment, isolate it from the rest of your wardrobe and get it professionally cleaned.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Norasit Kaewsai/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you’d like to try tackling mould removal at home, the Maskell-Bells suggest taking a damp cotton or microfibre cloth and dipping it in a little white vinegar with a few drops of lemon juice. Then swipe this over the surface of the leather to remove the mould, and repeat until you are certain all the remaining spores are gone. Do this outdoors while wearing a protective mask as spores can be a health hazard, then leave the item in direct sunlight to dry.</p> <h2>Help! My leather got wet</h2> <p>If you happen to get caught in the rain while wearing a leather jacket or skirt, the Restory team says, “Don’t panic!” Just hang the item somewhere airy and let it dry slowly and naturally.</p> <p>“Don’t dry your item on radiators or near artificial heat sources as this risks distorting or warping the shape,” they say. “If it is suede, small rain spots can often be gently buffed away with a soft suede brush.”</p> <p>For more serious damage, take the item to an expert who can clean, recolour and restore the leather. Once the garment is dry, you may need to reapply a leather conditioner.</p> <p>Esber says, “Always remember, at its core, leather is a natural product and it will dry naturally if it’s left in the right, dry environment. And after that you’ll often find it’ll be like new!”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
