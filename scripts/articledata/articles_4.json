Unfortunately for the new head coach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 4-0 loss to Brentford</a> showed his players are failing to implement his style effectively, sapping morale to its lowest point at Old Trafford.</p> <p>It is admirable that Ten Hag wants to replicate the formula that has worked for him elsewhere to make huge strides at United in the long term but, with a fixture against Liverpool on Monday, another heavy loss could have significant ramifications. Trying to adjust to a new set of tactical and stylistic rules is hard for footballers at the best of times. When low on confidence it is almost impossible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/carlo-ancelotti-confirms-casemiro-will-move-to-manchester-united\">Manchester United agree Casemiro deal after Ancelotti confirms player exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To reach a stage where Ten Hag can make a real impact on the United squad he will have to work to their strengths in the short term. A pragmatic approach could aid a squad creaking under the pressure of being Manchester United players in a rut at the bottom of the Premier League table. Casemiro’s experience and footballing smarts should help a demoralised group when he is available but overloading those lacking belief with intricate plans is not beneficial.</p> <p>Those who have played under Ten Hag say his methods take time to get used to. At present United fans are behind him, knowing the breadth of the task, but if the first few months continue along these lines as the Dutchman waits for everything to click into place, then he might not be given the requisite time to correct the years of wrongs at United.</p> <p>If Brentford are capable of picking apart United, then Liverpool will be very confident of doing the same with interest. Jürgen Klopp’s side have drawn their first two games and will be looking to lay down a marker against a side with two defeats.</p> <p>Scott McTominay and Fred are not the long-term solution to United’s midfield problems but Ten Hag is having to work at present with what is available against Liverpool. Neither is able to provide sharp passing and quick progress up the pitch. One could have to partner Casemiro, and Ten Hag may want to test himself by converting the duo into being able to play something akin to his style. But that might be a step too far and he may need to play to their strengths rather than trying to correct in-built flaws.</p> <p>Lisandro Martínez was withdrawn after 45 minutes at Brentford but looks capable on the ball and smart enough to adapt to the direct nature of the Premier League, and in the coming weeks could be utilised in midfield alongside Casemiro.</p> <p>When Stefan Savic joined Manchester City, he struggled in the air and was bullied by numerous strikers, leaving him debilitated on the pitch. Despite his failings, Roberto Mancini insisted on putting him in the firing line when short on confidence. His City career never recovered. The Montenegrin, however, has gone on to have an impressive career with Fiorentina and Atlético Madrid, where he was managed with greater understanding and allowed to grow. Martínez will be targeted in the air regardless of opponent, and it may be sensible to adjust his position for now to avoid lasting damage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"228225d0a67c269aa3dde17f6f8e0208ee065fb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/228225d0a67c269aa3dde17f6f8e0208ee065fb3/0_126_3769_2262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisandro Martínez playing for Manchester United\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisandro Martínez could benefit by being moved into Manchester United’s midfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Federico Guerra Maranesi/PPAUK/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes it takes a backward step to allow a team to go forward. Under Ole Gunnar Solskjær United were set up to counterattack, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/20/manchester-united-have-bigger-problems-than-just-solskjaer\" title=\"\">accepting their limitations</a>. Strikers win matches but defences win titles – not that United should be too focused on the latter. If they manage to put together a sturdier defence for Liverpool’s visit, or at least one that does not concede four in 25 minutes, then it will help boost confidence, especially with the robust Casemiro to be added subsequently. They were disorganised at Brentford and were playing out from the back with a goalkeeper unable to provide the distribution required.</p> <p>Having Christian Eriksen on the pitch at the same time as Bruno Fernandes is a luxury this United side cannot afford. They are fine players but Ten Hag, to aid with stability, may need to decide between the two. Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea mix athleticism with skill on the pitch and United cannot survive on the latter alone, especially given how ineffectual dominating possession has been for them against Brighton and Brentford.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace showed Liverpool are vulnerable</a> to the counter; Wilfried Zaha breezed through a gap to score and United can utilise that weakness. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Anthony Martial and Anthony Elanga should be able to cause any side problems down the wings and can help United get up the pitch more quickly if they go more direct. They provide something Cristiano Ronaldo cannot: constant pressing. His legendary status is not in doubt but his inability to put defenders under pressure over the course of 90 minutes in a struggling United side means it may be time to make a tough decision.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/marc-cucurella-chelsea-eibar-teammates\">‘A player with no ego’: why Chelsea’s Marc Cucurella is so effective</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ten Hag has not thus far been given the players required to reverse the downward spiral United have endured in recent years. The squad is very similar to the one that struggled to sixth spot last season and looks unable to adapt quickly to the methods Ten Hag is trying to instil, so it may be a case of better the Red Devils you know. The scattergun approach over transfers to appease Ten Hag is an intriguing one. It is hard to plan when the targets are very different in what they offer a team. Adrien Rabiot and Casemiro are certainly not the same type of player. With less than two weeks until the transfer window closes, few can guess what the squad will look like.</p> <p>Mikel Arteta has added Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko to his ranks, two 25-year-olds who know what it takes to win the Premier League. United will be hoping for a similar impact from Casemiro. It has taken numerous windows for Arsenal to sculpt the squad they want and United will need to accept they are in the same boat and that panic buys in this window may not aid them down the line.</p> <p>Simplifying things in the short term to restore United to a level they can build from makes the most sense for Ten Hag but it will mean going against his ideals. As a person he is direct and to the point and, for now at least, it might be best if his team are too.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/20/night-dances-review-zoo-southside-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"Night Dances review – ecstasy on the dancefloor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/20/night-dances-review-zoo-southside-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/20/night-dances-review-zoo-southside-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Night Dances review – ecstasy on the dancefloor","trailText":"The sweat and the groove are all that matters in Emma Martin’s mesmerising dance sequences, which capture the power of getting lost in your own rhythms","byline":"David Jays","body":"<p>Sweat pools, hands rise in the air, buttocks twerk like there’s no tomorrow. It’s late at night and people are dancing, each lost in a world of their own. Emma Martin’s Night Dances, first seen in Dublin in 2021, is about the ecstasy of moving on a dancefloor that time forgot.</p> <p>A huge circular light hangs above the stage and Stephen Dodd’s lighting stains the powdery air in deep tones of scarlet and maraschino. Three musicians (led by Daniel Fox of Gilla Band) stand at the back, metallic, electric and deafening: ushers hand out earplugs. It feels subterranean, nocturnal, all a bit David Lynch, where time loses its meaning and the uncanny is unleashed.</p> <p>Four successive sequences show people absorbed in their own rhythms. A shirtless man in blue trackies with an unnerving stare and a giraffe tattoo paces as we arrive, then starts throwing shapes in the muted light. Arms lifted, he moves to a soundtrack in his head, fighting, falling and folding in on himself.</p> <p>Suddenly, a young girl in sugar pink appears, and the man slinks off. The girl parks her gum on the side of the keyboard and, with her dance troupe in gym shorts and ponytails, launches into a ferocious routine – all bend and snap, a fusillade of synchronised rolls, kicks and cartwheels. Unfazed by the scuzzy wall of sound, they’re mesmerising but unsettling at this late hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7016096037f80e54cdd0c36f93374185a9187860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7016096037f80e54cdd0c36f93374185a9187860/0_170_5472_3478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Night Dances.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ferocious … Night Dances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next, another flailing bloke, guitar riffs staggering him off balance.

Now he’s ready to see if people want to hear the guy behind the gags","byline":"Laura Barton","body":"<p>When he was “around 14”, Bret McKenzie became obsessed with the Leonard Cohen album I’m Your Man. Its synth-heavy tales of geopolitics, romantic devotion and the poems of Federico García Lorca made it an unusual choice for a pubescent boy in suburban New Zealand. Nevertheless, at school, he and his friends would happily sing along to tracks such as Jazz Police and First We Take Manhattan when passing between lessons.</p> <p>As they sang, McKenzie listened to the voices of his peers, plumbing Cohen’s baritone depths. Meanwhile his own, still unbroken, squeaked along beside them. Even then, he saw the comedy in this collision: the autumnal wit of the lyrics, the juvenile scratch of the voice. It instilled in him a new sense of how songs could be: “Serious, but also strange, and funny in a weird way,” is how he describes it. “I think that’s always stuck with me.”</p> <p>Over the past 25 years, McKenzie, 46, has forged a career that has existed in a similar space; songs born at the precise meeting point of sincerity and humour. He made his name as one half of Flight of the Conchords, the comedy duo he formed with his university flatmate Jemaine Clement that grew from the live comedy circuit of New Zealand to a BBC Radio 2 series, an HBO sitcom, sold-out arena shows and a Grammy award for best comedy album.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dad2fd257394d47f999f54159858972984d755d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dad2fd257394d47f999f54159858972984d755d/0_1813_6164_6160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainbow connection … McKenzie teams up with Kermit (left) for the Muppets reboots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainbow connection … McKenzie teams up with Kermit (left) for the Muppets reboots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zachary Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, he would move into creating scores for film and television, writing songs for big-budget projects such as The Simpsons and the Muppets, while taking up occasional acting roles in films such as The Lord of the Rings and Austenland. His work has been marked by its delight, innovation and wordplay.</p> <p>This year, McKenzie’s career takes an unexpected turn with the release of his first non-comedy solo record, Songs Without Jokes. Its tracks carry notes of Steely Dan, Harry Nilsson and Randy Newman, its contributors include some of Los Angeles’ most-revered session musicians, and while there is unquestionably great wit at play, there is also sincerity and real tenderness.</p> <p>“To try and not be funny was a curious songwriting challenge,” says McKenzie, speaking from his home studio in Wellington, New Zealand. “When I started, I felt a little naked, because I think in comedy songs you’re hiding behind jokes. You don’t really open yourself up.”</p> <p>This is not to suggest the new songs are wildly exposing or unduly austere; rather they just land differently. “There’s still a bit of a lyrical playfulness that I find hard to resist,” he says. “But it was interesting even starting to play these songs to other people and see they were all surprised – this is not what they were expecting.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had to record another version of Man or Muppet because they didn’t really like it … It was a cultural adjustment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McKenzie is well aware of what people have come to expect from him. “I’m hired to put the heart into songs or projects,” is how he explains it. “They’ve got this idea or this thing that they know they can make money from, but they need your soul to put into these songs or these scripts. And the more songs I’ve done for film, the more I’ve learned that if you can get that heart into a song, it can transcend the Hollywood process.”</p> <p>A good example is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8EURqoKLY8\" title=\"\">Man or Muppet</a>, a track from 2011’s The Muppets that scored McKenzie an Oscar for best original song. The song performs like a traditional power ballad, uniting two characters – human Jason Segel and Muppet Walter – in an emotional climax as each suddenly sees some aspect of himself in the other. “And so I wrote it the way you would write a genuine, heartfelt ballad,” McKenzie says. “But the material is about being a man or a muppet.”</p> <p>You can trace a similar subversion through his work with Flight of the Conchords. Business Time, for instance, which appeared on the duo’s debut EP, struck the seductive tone of a Barry White number, while its lyrics told of eroticism eroded by domestic routine: “Girl, tonight we’re gonna make love,” it purred. “You know how I know? Because it’s Wednesday / And Wednesday is the night that we usually make love.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a98e1b4f26d17fe1c1304cc705f6bee5562a659c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98e1b4f26d17fe1c1304cc705f6bee5562a659c/0_83_2100_1259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McKenzie with Jemaine Clement (right) in Flight of the Conchords.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timeless flight … McKenzie with Jemaine Clement (right) in Flight of the Conchords.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McKenzie recalls how devoted he and Clement were to honing their songwriting. “We used to spend hours singing the same song over and over and over again, just to figure out the way to get a lyric to sit perfectly,” he says. “Because you change a couple of words here or there and sometimes it doesn’t fit, and then you’d be singing and miss the word for the next line.”</p> <p>Still, it took some time for Hollywood to warm to the pair – or perhaps for them to come to understand the peculiar dance of showbusiness in Los Angeles. McKenzie recalls driving between meetings with studio executives, Clement in the passenger seat, their agent on speakerphone imploring them to just bring a little more pep to their next meeting. “He’d say: ‘Try putting a bit more energy in. Just try it – just be a bit more enthusiastic.’”</p> <p>Even when he began working with Disney, the studio seemed sceptical about McKenzie’s ability to write songs for the Muppets. And when he wrote Man or Muppet, they weren’t entirely convinced by it. “I had to record another version of the same song because they didn’t really like that one,” he says. “They didn’t really believe I could do it.” He smiles. “Anyway since then they’re obviously very supportive and I’ve been really lucky,” he adds, diplomatically. “But also it was a cultural adjustment.”</p> <p>These days, McKenzie regards the film songwriting process as half puzzle, half sorcery. “The job is quite a lot like doing crosswords or sudokus,” he says, “but for me it’s usually about getting the melody and the lyric idea. It’s like alchemy where you get it to fuse, I guess. And when I get that right I can usually tell, because I can keep playing it over and over and over again and I still enjoy it.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My demos have a lo-fi, indie looseness, but the band was super-slick. I was like: ‘God! I’ve got to pick up my game here</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Songs Without Jokes took root in the film sessions McKenzie worked on in Los Angeles. Standing in some of the best recording studios in the world, he was surrounded by acclaimed musicians such as guitarist Dean Parks and bassist Lee Sklar, producer and pianist Drew Erickson and drummer Joey Waronker, marvelling at their skill, and startled by the faith they had in him.</p> <p>“I’d had this idea of wanting to do something different and I mentioned it to Lee one day,” he remembers. “And he was so positive and enthusiastic. He said: ‘That sounds great, I’m in!’ It was a cool moment for me, because his enthusiasm for the idea and his willingness to be involved gave me this real boost of: OK, I should do this! I should go for it!”</p> <p>He lights up when he talks about this time, these players; of the day Parks rolled up to the studio with a truckload of 100 guitars, of the art of capturing “the weird, awkward, bluesy LA sound” of Steely Dan, and of how Chris Caswell, the longstanding composer and arranger for the Muppets, is himself “quite Muppet-y in a way”.</p> <p>“Most of them are from a different generation of musician,” McKenzie says. “They’re pre-cut and paste. They just do whole takes of the song, and the takes are really great. People don’t really play like that so much now; I think a lot of songs now are written in pieces and then put together.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"124ce0ad5bbffd3ca6432d6a3b43526ee9c7a2e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/124ce0ad5bbffd3ca6432d6a3b43526ee9c7a2e2/16_798_2502_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McKenzie celebrates his Oscar win at the Academy Awards in 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McKenzie celebrates his Oscar win at the Academy Awards in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Brooker/RexX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McKenzie was keen to conjure a similar era of songwriting and musicianship for the album. Over the years he had collected a number of songs, all without jokes, often written at night and when his children were small. He used his family as a kind of quality control: if his wife poked her head around the door and asked whether he had recorded the track she overheard him playing, he knew he was on to a winner. Similarly, if he heard his children still singing along to one of the tunes the next morning, he knew he’d written something catchy. “It was like the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/anniversaries/september/the-old-grey-whistle-test/\" title=\"\">‘old grey whistle test’</a> at home,” he says.</p> <p>Out of these home recordings, he and producer Mickey Petralia, with whom McKenzie had worked on Flight of the Conchords and Muppets material, began to assemble demos. Initially aiming for a 70s sound, their shared love for synthesisers and drum machines inevitably brought in an 80s vibe. “I feel something happened in the 70s and 80s in these recording studios that makes me wish I was there,” McKenzie says. “It just sounds like it was such a golden time of recording, and at these studios in Los Angeles that I was working in, so many of the records on the walls are from that period, and were records I aspired to.”</p> <p>McKenzie was also struck by the speed with which the session players were able to work. “It’s crazy, the wisdom they have, the studio wisdom, the little things that can really help with the recording process,” he says. With the session musicians on side, he and Petralia reasoned they could make an album in four days flat.</p> <p>It actually took two and a half years. McKenzie looks sheepish when asked where the delay occurred. “The singing, basically,” he laughs. “All my demos have a real lo-fi, indie looseness to them, because my playing is a little more low-key,” he explains. “But suddenly when the band was super-slick I was like: ‘Oh my God! I’ve really got to pick up my game here, guys!’ So that was a big challenge.” The trick, he says, was to sing the songs over and over, to settle them in. “And I realise now that I’m getting a little more experienced and that I should pay a bit more attention to what key a song is in before I record it.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Covid everyone came back to Wellington as it seemed a good place to be. It’s interesting, these cool people returning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McKenzie has now been home for three years – the result of New Zealand’s controlled approach to the pandemic. He talks of how good it has been to spend time with his wife and three children, but a flicker of cabin fever moves across his face as he speaks. “That’s a pretty big shift for me after living and working in Los Angeles, and travelling, and touring for probably 20 years,” he says. “It’s pretty strange.”</p> <p>Still, there has been an unexpected richness to these landlocked months in his homeland. “There’s a thing with New Zealand where lots of people leave for work opportunities and things,” he says. “But during Covid everyone came back, because it seemed like a good place to be. So it’s been quite an interesting time in Wellington, because there’s been all these cool people returning with all these cool skills.” And McKenzie has kept busy. Just prior to lockdown he was workshopping a musical adaptation of George Saunders’ story The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil, with the director Lyndsey Turner and the playwright Tim Price. Since then there have been songs for a Ron Howard-directed animation, the possible revival of a long back-burnered Hollywood project about a man stuck in a musical, and, of course, an episode of The Simpsons titled Panic on the Streets of Springfield, in which he parodied the work of Morrissey.</p> <p>McKenzie laughs as he recalls writing the track Everyone Is Horrid Except Me (and Possibly You) and the subsequent “weird 2am Zoom session with Benedict Cumberbatch [who in the episode plays Quilloughby, lead singer of The Snuffs] doing his best Morrissey impression”. It was not a particularly big ask. “I’m a pretty big Smiths fan, so it wasn’t hard for me to channel that sound,” he says. “It was just really fun to write an overly dramatic melody. We had a ball.”</p> <p>The long stretch at home has also given him time to contemplate a Flight of the Conchords reunion. “I don’t know what it would be, and I can only speak for myself, but I’m probably more interested than I would’ve been in the past,” he says. “There’s just been enough time, enough distance; I try and do things that I will find fun, and I think that could be a fun thing to do now.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/18/best-comedians-of-the-21st-century-comics-standup-comedy\">The 50 best comedians of the 21st century</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the time being he is looking forward to touring the new record, to being in the room with actual people once more. “I spent too much time working at home.

When Angharad Rees and Robin Ellis shot to fame in the BBC series Poldark in 1975, it started a stampede to visit locations such as Kynance Cove and Holywell Bay, both reportedly revisited by House of the Dragon.</p> <p>The more recent edition of Poldark, plus Doc Martin, boosted visitor numbers again. “That was big among the 50-plus age group,” says Bell. “But we’re hoping that House of the Dragon might give us exposure to a younger audience worldwide.”</p> <p>The statistics bear out his hope. <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/993970/united-states-engagement-game-of-thrones-by-generation/\">More than a quarter</a> of all US millennials (born 1981-1996) watched Game of Thrones. With House of the Dragon expected to deploy similar ingredients (plenty of female nudity and bloody violence), viewing figures are expected to follow suit.</p> <p>For Cornwall, however, there are cautionary voices. This is not a place starting from a low level of tourism: the industry in the county is already worth £2bn. When lockdown ended in July 2021, about 2 million visitors arrived within 12 weeks, straining local patience and resources and leading to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/15839380/cornwall-tourists-expensive-beaches-backlash/\">the Sun headline</a>: ‘Tourists say Cornwall is too noisy and expensive’.</p> <p>The accommodation provider <a href=\"https://www.sawdays.co.uk/\">Sawday’s</a>, which owns the glamping specialist <a href=\"https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/\">Canopy and Stars</a>, has already announced a limit on its expansion in the region. Mike Bevens, its managing director, says: “The constant desire for insatiable growth by some holiday operators is unsustainable. The industry can’t keep gorging itself on the generosity of local infrastructure, communities and the environment without considering the longer-term effects.”</p> <p>The message is backed up by Mark Duddridge, from the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership, whose 2021 <a href=\"https://cioslep.com/unlocking-sustainable-tourism-in-cornwall-and-scilly-mark-duddridge/\">report</a> stated: “Simply adding more visitors to our existing pattern of peak-to-trough seasonality is not what we want in terms of jobs, steady income, our environment or our experience of living in Cornwall.”</p> <p>Bevens thinks visitors could explore other Cornish locations. “I’d suggest Restormel Castle, Botelet, or the Lizard and Roseland peninsulas.”</p> <p>The Peak District is also thought to feature in the new series, with Matt Smith spotted during filming in the village of Castleton and at Mam Tor. Jo Dilley, the managing director of Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire, welcomes the presence of the television crews but is keen to point out that the area has more to offer than a couple of film locations. “We have over 500 sq km of open access land to explore – plenty of places to escape the crowds.”</p> <p>Those seeking other-worldly landscapes and magic, she suggests, could try the gritstone edges of Stanage, Curbar and the aptly named Dragon’s Back ridge near the village of Hollinsclough.</p> <p>For Trujillo and Cáceres in the south-western Spanish province of Extremadura, House of the Dragon is definitely a follow-up – they hosted Game of Thrones and have seen a significant effect on visitor numbers.</p> <p>Just across the border in Portugal, however, the hilltop village of Monsanto has lured film-makers with its troglodytic homes and massive granite boulders and is hoping for a similar tourism boost.</p> <p>The wider region has suffered wildfires this year. “It’s a tragedy,” says Antonio Lacerda, the general manager for tourism promotion in nearby <a href=\"https://www.visitalentejo.pt/en/\">Alentejo</a> region, pointing out that much of the mountain area has been burned. “Some places won’t be able to welcome visitors until next year.”</p> <p>He points out that, alongside Monsanto, there are other, “timeless atmospheric hilltop villages … like Marvão and Monsaraz”.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 August 2022 to remove an incorrect statement that the village of Monsanto in Portugal had been damaged by wildfires. To clarify, the wider region suffered wildfires this year but Monsanto was not affected.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/20/prison-reform-aging-parole-medical-care-valerie-gaiter","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T10:00:37Z","webTitle":"New York’s ageing prisoners languish with poor medical care and little hope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/20/prison-reform-aging-parole-medical-care-valerie-gaiter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/20/prison-reform-aging-parole-medical-care-valerie-gaiter","fields":{"headline":"New York’s ageing prisoners languish with poor medical care and little hope","trailText":"Advocates in New York hope the case of Valerie Gaiter, who died in prison after 40 years behind bars, will help bring reform","byline":"Gloria Oladipo","body":"<p>“Val was given Pepto-Bismol when she went to the nurse’s office.

Would a desperate experiment with street narcotics make me see things differently?","byline":"Sophie Knight","body":"<p>At first being diagnosed with ADHD came as a relief. I cried in the psychiatrist’s office: maybe I wasn’t lazy after all. He<strong> </strong>gave me pills that, within days, offered me a glimpse of what I thought a neurotypical person’s brain might feel like: focused and smooth, like a game of leisurely tennis rather than a ball machine going berserk.</p> <p>Dexamphetamine felt like a silver bullet. Suddenly I could plan ahead, follow entire meetings, and pack a bag without having a nervous breakdown. Gone was the constantly harried feeling that had bullied me into perpetual motion for most of my 34 years. There seemed to be more time in each second to listen, absorb and think. I no longer wanted to punch people in the back of the head when they were blocking my way in the supermarket.</p> <p>But after a year on stimulants, things began to unravel. I had constant migraine-like headaches, and was anxious and impatient. When I decided to quit, I was mired in lethargy and mental confusion that lingered far longer than the supposed “withdrawal” window. Had I always felt this foggy before the drugs? Or was it the drugs?</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>I had been a restless child. The first night I slept in a bed rather than a cot, I rolled on to the floor nine times. Even before I could walk, I was constantly wriggling, fidgeting, climbing things. My parents nicknamed me Tigger, after the perpetually bouncy Winnie-the-Pooh character. “You were cute and charming – but very annoying,” my mother recalls.</p> <p>Still, the idea that I might have ADHD never came up. In the UK in the 90s, it was cast as a disorder of naughty boys who struggled at school. I was socially adept and academically successful – gifted, even.</p> <p>I drove myself regularly to exhaustion as a teenager, but it was only once I left home to go to university in London that things really began to fall apart. Without the structure of regular mealtimes and bedtimes, my rhythms became erratic. I couldn’t sit still and study unless I was physically exhausted.<strong> </strong>I set myself unrealistic goals and took on too much: training for a half-marathon, two part-time jobs, a rule that I couldn’t eat anything I hadn’t cooked myself. After frantic waitressing shifts and studying benders, I drank to get to sleep.</p> <p>With a brain like mine, you’re always “on”: a torrent of thoughts and sensations come in like spray from a fire hydrant, and you’re left desperately trying to stem the flow. Even when sick, I feel like I’m being driven by a piston engine, pushing me to move even though my muscles are worn out and my mind is begging for peace.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>At first, Ritalin seemed to fix … everything. I had to take my pills with food, so I began eating regular meals. I even slept better</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Certain requirements for being an active member of society – and an employee – eluded me: a regular sleep rhythm, for one, as well as consistency and an ability to conserve energy for big events or tasks. It didn’t matter how many habits I tried to build, or “hacks” I adopted. I still oscillated between being manic, sleepless and obsessive or catatonic, blinded by brain fog and exhausted, physically and mentally.</p> <p>My career in journalism and research has been characterised by the same boom-and-bust cycle: I get a job, throw myself into it, and then burn out so badly I can’t work for months. After a stint in Japan, I moved to the Netherlands in 2015, hoping for a quieter life. But even on a four-day work week as a researcher, I ended up running myself into the ground again. I went freelance.</p> <p>It was while I was languishing in yet another burnout in late 2020 that a friend sent me an article about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/02/the-lost-girls-chaotic-and-curious-women-with-adhd-all-have-missed-red-flags-that-haunt-us\" title=\"\">women with ADHD eluding diagnosis until late in life</a>.<strong> </strong>I used to be sceptical of ADHD as a diagnosable disorder, as well as the idea of doling out stimulants to supposed sufferers. In 2014, when a therapist first suggested I might have ADHD, I wrote to a friend: “I’m upset and angry to think that someone who just has energy and the will to move is labelled as sick.” But every word of the article had resonated. I resolved to go for a diagnosis. </p> <p>I wasn’t alone: referrals for adult ADHD assessment skyrocketed during the pandemic. Psychiatry-UK, a private company contracted by the NHS, recorded a quadrupling of referrals between 2020 and 2022 compared with the two previous years. And even before Covid, prescriptions of stimulants for ADHD had soared: <a href=\"https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/medicines-used-mental-health-england/medicines-used-mental-health-england-201516-202021\" title=\"\">a record 161,584 adults were given medication in 2021</a>, an increase of more than 50% from 2015.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The psychiatrist started me on Ritalin at first. During the early weeks, it seemed to fix … everything. Because I had to take my pills with food, and they wore off every four hours, I began eating meals at regular times. I even slept better, because I no longer needed to drink coffee. My hypersensitivity to light, noise and sensation faded away: clothes labels no longer bothered me to distraction. The sense of frustration and impatience just dried up. I felt like I was peacefully moving through the world, doing one thing at a time, able to focus on what was important rather than trivial tasks.</p> <p>“Sounds great,” said my psychiatrist on our first check-in call. I brought up the downsides: insomnia, rapid heartbeat. “The side-effects will diminish, as long as you take it on a regular schedule every day,” he reassured me.</p> <p>The amount of work I got done on Ritalin – and the calm it brought – was impressive. But the hyperfocus could be scary. The singular piercing beam of attention it created would latch on to whatever I was looking at, then refuse to let go for the next few hours. I could be in the middle of a dull WhatsApp conversation, but I just couldn’t tear myself away. If my ceiling had caved in, I would have put off fixing it until later. </p> <p>Ritalin also made me depressed. One day I texted a friend: “I feel emotionally dark. Uneasy. Not looking forward to anything. Everything feels really grey. Been pacing the apartment.” It also made my heart race – once, I had a heart rate of 110bpm while doing the washing up. I asked to switch to another medication.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I’d tried meditation, acupuncture, running, handstands, CBT, cold showers, blue-light-blocking glasses … nothing came close to medication</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dexamphetamine felt gentler: the beam of attention was more diffuse, cloaking distractions in shadow but allowing me to move from one task to another. Best of all, I didn’t feel depressed. Shortly after starting on dexamphetamine, I landed a commission for an ambitious article, and an intense full-time research project. I started working long days, marvelling at my focus and ability to ignore domestic distractions. I felt productive and efficient, finally able to work like other people. I want to be on this forever,<em> </em>I thought.</p> <p>One day, a friend’s boyfriend saw me take my pills, and asked what they were. I told him, but before I could describe all the benefits I’d experienced, he launched into a tirade about how ADHD was a disease of modern society, how technology had shortened our attention spans, and how I just needed to train my focus.</p> <p>“Have you tried juggling?” he asked.</p> <p>I walked out flushed, angry and upset. My diagnosis had given me an<strong> </strong>explanation for why things felt so difficult, why I felt so stressed all the time, why I couldn’t turn glimmers of promise into consistent effort. Why my emotions felt so intense and all-consuming, why I had such low self-esteem and why, unlike all my friends, I’d never been able to stay in a job.</p> <p>The diagnosis had quietened the cruel inner voice that told me these problems were personal failings, caused by a lack of effort or tenacity. Anyone who tried to tell me that ADHD was made up and that the medication was a big pharma con raised my hackles, because they seemed to imply that my initial conviction was correct: I was lazy and inept, and just needed to try harder.</p> <p>I felt like I’d spent my whole life trying harder. I’d tried meditation, acupuncture, time-management strategies, working offline, running, handstands, cognitive behavioural therapy, cold showers, blue-light-blocking glasses … nothing even came close to medication.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Still, I couldn’t deny that the side-effects were miserable. There was the dry mouth, the relentless thirst, the burning tongue. I was constantly parched, and pissing like a racehorse. Food just seemed to pass straight through me. I lost 4kg, revealing the contours of my ribs.</p> <p>“You can’t blame this on the medication,” said my psychiatrist sternly when I told him. “Yes, reduced appetite is a side-effect, but it’s your responsibility to eat more and to regain that weight.” I tried eating more chocolate, more butter, fewer vegetables. Pastries for lunch. But food wasn’t interesting. It had become fuel.</p> <p>Managing two intense projects at once, which had seemed so magically possible for the first few weeks, began to take its toll. When I was working, I felt sharp and motivated; the rest of the time, I felt strung out and empty.</p> <p>Worst of all were the rebounds. Dexamphetamine seemed to work by gathering the shimmering strands of my scattered attention and focusing them into a laser beam. But when it wore off, the strands would come loose again, bouncing like a dropped box of toothpicks. I’d get a migraine-like headache that made me confused and unable to follow conversations, listen to music, or think straight. It hurt to look at things. I became hypersensitive to sound. Some days, I’d be reduced to lying in bed with earplugs and an eye mask.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Some women benefit from increasing their medication in the week before their period. But that just made me feel spun-out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Try taking another dose later in the day,” my psychiatrist suggested. “Some people find that they can avoid the rebound by timing it with when they go to sleep.” But upping my dose just stole my appetite for dinner, and kept me awake at night.</p> <p>The rebound was worse on the days before my period. My psychiatrist admitted he didn’t know much about the interaction between medication and hormones, but he did send me a <a href=\"https://adhdnetwerk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/S.Kooij-Hormonal-Moodchanges-in-women-with-ADHD-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">presentation</a> showing that women with ADHD are far more likely to suffer with PMT, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and postnatal depression. Some women, the presentation said, benefit from increasing their dose in the week before their period. But that just made me feel spun-out, and made the rebound more acute. I decided to stop taking it on the worst days of my cycle, even if that meant I couldn’t get any work done at all.<strong> </strong></p> <p>By spring this year, I was taking weekends, days, or even whole weeks off the drugs at a time. (My psychiatrist had advised against this, but some prescribers<strong> </strong>say “drug holidays” do no harm, or can even be beneficial, allowing the heart and kidneys a break and preventing desensitisation). But I felt so foggy and lethargic from the withdrawal, I would end up just going back to the pills.</p> <p>I had thought I might be on the medication for the rest of my life. But now, I started fearing that I was causing myself some kind of long-term damage. If I felt worse on days when I didn’t take the pills – worse than I did before medication – had I actually damaged my body’s ability to feel OK?</p> <p>***</p> <p>My psychiatrist had assured me the medication was safe, backed up by decades of clinical research. But when I went digging for scientific papers, I found that there is precious little evidence of how dexamphetamine and methylphenidate (the generic name for Ritalin) may affect the brain, heart, liver and kidneys when taken for years.</p> <p>Most research has been done on children, and the longitudinal studies looked at behavioural outcomes and quality of life rather than neurobiology. Research done on children taking methylphenidate shows that it can actually help their brains <a href=\"https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2019182528\" title=\"\">grow in a way conducive to improved focus</a>, even if the child stopped taking it. But the research did not find the same effect in the brains of people who began taking methylphenidate as adults.</p> <p>While there is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670101/\" title=\"\">evidence from autopsies of addicts’ brains</a> that chronic amphetamine abuse can induce permanent brain damage, hardly any research has been done into how dexamphetamine – which is chemically different from the amphetamines sold on the street – affects the brain over the long-term when taken at a prescription dose. Such a posthumous study into dexamphetamine has, however, been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670101/\" title=\"\">done on primates</a>. It showed that prescription-level doses damage the brain’s system for delivering dopamine, further exacerbating the very imbalance supposedly responsible for ADHD in the first place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2022/may/12/why-arent-women-getting-diagnosed-with-adhd\">Why aren’t women getting diagnosed with ADHD?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s not clear what that means for humans. But some psychiatrists think the long-term consequences could be significant, and that stimulant medications are vastly overprescribed considering the potential risks.</p> <p>Joanna Moncrieff, a professor in psychiatry at University College London, has spent her career challenging what she sees as the overuse of psychoactive drugs to treat mental disorders. Moncrieff, who recently published a controversial review paper stating that there was <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0\" title=\"\">a lack of evidence</a> for depression being caused by low levels of serotonin, does not believe ADHD is caused by an impaired dopamine system in the brain.</p> <p>“All mental disorders are no more than clusters of symptoms; that is, clusters of behaviours or problems that people describe. There is no definitive link with biochemical abnormality,” she says. “ADHD drugs merely induce an abnormal state that alters the expression of symptoms.”</p> <p>While I don’t agree with all of Moncrieff’s views – she believes that adult ADHD doesn’t exist and has been cooked up by pharmaceutical companies and embraced by perfectionists who want to become superhuman – some of what she says resonates. These pills don’t “normalise” my brain any more than sedatives “normalise” a person in the throes of psychosis. They induce a certain state that sometimes feels helpful – but do I want to stay in that state for ever, with all the short-term side-effects as well as the potential for unknown long-term consequences?</p> <p>***</p> <p>In March,<strong> </strong>I resolved to quit. I told everyone that this time it was for good. I hunkered down to weather the exhaustion and listlessness of withdrawal. My muscles ached; my head felt like it was stuffed with cotton wool. Just a few days of this, I told myself.</p> <p>But it didn’t entirely go away. I was behind at work, struggling to make sense of my list of tasks. I had a video call about a potential project, but it was as if everyone was speaking in Greek. I wrote notes in the hope that it might help me understand what was happening but, while my hand was moving, no information was coming in.</p> <p>After a week, I’d had enough. “Maybe just a little,” I thought, breaking a pill in half.</p> <p>An hour later, I felt a hushed calm descending, like snow falling on a fire. The muscle pain that had blared like a klaxon in my head for the past few days hovered quietly somewhere in the distance. I started to write, and the words poured out effortlessly. I marvelled: this magical feeling, with just a third of my prescribed dose?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The nadir came when I took a bump of speed instead of my prescription, to try to feel some energy and blast the fog out of my head</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The next day, of course, I took the same amount. It felt less magical, but still preferable to my unmedicated state. I began taking the pills as needed, rather than on the regular schedule that my psychiatrist had urged me to adhere to, and in far smaller doses than I’d been prescribed.</p> <p>Still searching for ways to reduce the headaches and rebounds, and having exhausted my psychiatrist’s suggestions, I found a post on Reddit that suggested letting the tablets dissolve under my tongue instead of swallowing them. Intrigued, I dug for more, and ended up on the Reddit forum for “tweakers”, or people who take amphetamines as “smart drugs”, to improve their cognition and efficiency. Trawling through their posts, I saw people going through precisely the same struggle as I was: loving what the drug made them capable of, struggling with its side-effects, and trying to find a way they could keep taking it without ruining their lives.</p> <p>I began to worry that I was behaving like a speed addict. I kept telling everyone that I was getting off the drugs but, the next day, the craving burned so strongly I snuck back to get my fix.</p> <p>***</p> <p>During my assessment, my psychiatrist asked whether I’d ever taken speed. “Some people with ADHD find that when they’ve taken ecstasy or speed, they experience the opposite effect to what most people experience: it calms them down rather than making them energetic,” he explained.</p> <p>Having never tried illicit amphetamine, I couldn’t relate. But a year and a half later, in May this year, I decided to try it while clubbing in Berlin. Before going, I took our stash of drugs to a <a href=\"https://www.ggd.amsterdam.nl/geintegreerde-voorzieningen/drugstestservice/\" title=\"\">drug-testing centre</a> in Amsterdam, funded by the Dutch government. (They like to keep an eye on drug purity, as well as prices and market trends). I asked the tester the difference between dexamphetamine and street amphetamine. </p> <p>She explained that street amphetamine adheres less strongly to the brain’s dopamine receptors than stimulants for ADHD – giving more of an “up” feeling and less of the calm concentration. “Also,” she added, “it’s likely you’ve just got a higher tolerance for speed than other people. I’ve got ADHD and I’ve figured out I need to take more to get the same effect.”</p> <p>I arrived in Berlin tired and achy, having taken the advice of another friend with ADHD to come off my medication for a few days beforehand to avoid overdosing or drug interactions. On the day of our big night out, I was in bed crying, suffering from a heavy headache and fatigue. But at 10pm, I did a line, just to see what would happen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Having ADHD means that, even more than the average person, you have to find out what makes you tick and pursue it – even if it changes weekly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Speed, I discovered, made me feel confident, but not histrionically so. By the time we rocked up to the notorious techno club Berghain just before dawn, I had the requisite nonchalance for getting past the famously intimidating bouncers.</p> <p>In the toilets, I talked to a girl who’d just emerged from a cubicle. “Sometimes, all you need is a big, fat line of speed,” she said, beaming. I told her about my dexamphetamine. “I’ve always wondered what it’s like to be on medication,” she said, enviously. “I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, but my psychiatrist won’t give me a prescription because he says I do speed too often on the weekends.”</p> <p>Once back from Berlin, the familiar exhaustion and headaches crept back. Dexamphetamine seemed to just make me tired. I wondered if amphetamine might work better – it had made me dance for hours, after all.</p> <p>The nadir came when I took a bump of speed – tipped out of its little paper wrap, carefully stored in my freezer – instead of my own prescription, to try and feel some physical energy and to blast the fog out of my head. “Where does this end?” I asked myself.</p> <p>Realising what a slippery slope I was on – and the stupidity of taking street amphetamines instead of medical-grade prescription pills – my experiment only lasted one day. But I couldn’t stop thinking about how pro-drug psychiatrists like to maintain an illusory boundary between ADHD medications and amphetamines sold on the street. Where is the line between prescription and recreational speed?</p> <p>***</p> <p>Relying on a stimulant to resolve your psychological distress is never going to solve everything. Not only do the side-effects mean that I don’t want to be on it every day and have to resort to old strategies – frantic cleaning missions of the house to procrastinate, meditation, blocking the internet, to-do lists, lots of walks – it also can’t give me the consistency I crave, nor the capacity to work eight-hour days without getting itchy and enraged. At some point, I have to accept that I might not fit society’s idea of productivity or normality – and that that’s OK.</p> <p>Having ADHD means that, even more than the average person, you have to find out what makes you tick and pursue it – even if that changes weekly.<strong> </strong>The truth remains that the drugs do ameliorate the worst of my symptoms – and often, for me, in a way that feels necessary. There are days when I cannot get even half an hour of work done without medication. (That was also the case before the drugs.)

Now Krishna Léger is one of the country’s most exciting chefs. What made him change his ways?","byline":"Laura Spinney","body":"<p>Krishna Léger is confident he is the only person to have smuggled fresh fish into Les Baumettes in Marseille, one of the most notorious prisons in France. With the fish he made bouillabaisse, the famous Marseillais soup. One of his fellow inmates – also from Marseille – said it was the best he had ever tasted.</p> <p>These days, Léger serves bouillabaisse on the first Sunday of every month at his restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.volver-restaurant.fr/\" title=\"\">Volver</a>, just outside the pretty medieval town of Uzès, in the southern French département of the Gard.</p> <p>The setting is a little different from Les Baumettes, with its once high walls and watchtowers (the old prison buildings were demolished this year, to be replaced with new ones): Volver is set in a lemon-coloured stone farmhouse with shutters as blue as the Cévennes mountains visible in the distance, and a terrace shaded by a pergola. In 2021, only two years after it<em> </em>opened, Léger was awarded an <a href=\"https://guide.michelin.com/en/occitanie/serviers-et-labaume/restaurant/volver-1191414\" title=\"\">“assiette”</a> – the first rung on the Michelin ladder. And though he is discreet about his past, once the service is done, he can sometimes be persuaded to recount how he, an ex-con, conquered the world of French <a href=\"https://labelleassiette.co.uk/blog/bistronomy-culinary-revolution/\" title=\"\">“bistronomy”</a> (“quality ingredients … superb cooking”).</p> <p>***</p> <p>On the afternoon of 27 February 1994, Léger, then a 24-year-old firefighter, flew from Paris to Nîmes. His girlfriend, Karine, and another friend met him at the airport, and the three of them got into Karine’s car.</p> <p>After a harsh winter, spring was stirring in the Gard. Happy to be together again, the trio stopped at a bar in the town of Remoulins. Dusk fell. When they got up to leave, Léger says that Karine asked him to drive the short distance to his home, because she wore contact lenses and didn’t like driving in the dark.</p> <p>Messing about in the car, one of the passengers accidentally thumped the steering wheel. The car spun off the road and hit a plane tree, then an oncoming car smashed into its side. Karine died. Léger, his friend and the driver of the other car were seriously injured. The police found him to be just over the alcohol limit.</p> <p>Léger had fractured his spine and was warned he might not walk again. He did, but only after six months of rehab. A court in Nîmes found him guilty of manslaughter and gave him a six-month suspended prison sentence. Losing his driving licence made it almost impossible to work. Karine’s parents supported him throughout. “They saw what happened as an accident, fate, even though they were devastated by the death of their daughter – as was I.” Still, he adds: “From that moment on, everything fell apart.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>They aren’t obliged to make life easy for a criminal who decides he wants to cook, but all they did was throw a spanner in the works</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Named Krishna for the Hindu god of compassion by his mother (one of the many <em><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/soixante-huitard\" title=\"\">soixante-huitards</a></em> who came to the Gard in the 1960s in search of a freer life), Léger viewed his childhood as a joyful time, even though his parents separated when he was four (the name was a burden for a small French boy, but “Kris” learned to live with it). However, his mother remarried and with her new husband made him feel unwelcome, so, aged 16, he left home and moved to Uzès. He got into fights, and channelled some of his energy into boxing.</p> <p>At first he worked as a volunteer firefighter. Then he passed his exams and joined the Paris fire service, sloping off at night to take part in clandestine bare-knuckle fights. After a team he was part of rescued seven people from a blaze at the now defunct Laennec hospital in 1991, he was awarded a medal for bravery. Soon he had a second, the National Defence Medal. The five years he spent in the capital were the best he had known.</p> <p>Sitting in Volver, surrounded by some of the colourful, abstract paintings his father left him, Léger, now 52, smiles easily beneath his cropped hair and five o’clock shadow. But his smile vanishes when he remembers the courtroom in Nîmes.</p> <p>There, he says, he encountered “only cold judgment, no humanity”. Nobody took into account his track record as a firefighter or his medals, he says. Nobody acknowledged that what had happened had been an accident, or that he was grieving, and there was no consideration of his plea to keep his licence so he could work. “They tear up your life, fling you to the bottom and say, ‘Now deal with it.’”</p> <p>Léger’s deep sense of injustice at that first brush with the law set him on a different path – one that would take him far from the Gard and even farther from the ideals represented by his namesake. “I revolted, turned my back on society, and, through some acquaintances, I pretty quickly entered into a parallel world of professional crime.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Léger is tall – 1.84 metres (6ft) – with the physique of a boxer. When he is wearing his white chef’s tunic, you sometimes catch a glimpse of the tattoo, an abstract design of his own creation, that covers the whole of his right arm.</p> <p>The first job he got after the accident was as a bouncer in a club. The owner had one foot in the underworld and, at Léger’s request, arranged his entrée into it. Before long, he had been sucked into the racket around illegal slot machines and was rubbing shoulders with the various mafias that worked the Côte d’Azur – Corsican, Italian, <em>Grenoblois</em>. He turned out to be good at judging which bars and arcades would bring in the most cash if he placed machines in them. It was the late 90s. He was earning a living, and moved to Nice.</p> <p>In 1999, after a settling of scores between crime groups on the Riviera that ended in gun violence, the police searched Léger’s home. They found a key that opened a garage containing a cache of arms, some of which had been used in the shooting. Arrested and charged with homicide and possession of firearms (the homicide charge was later dropped), he spent 96 hours in police custody before a court in Nice determined that he should be remanded in jail.</p> <p>He still remembers his state of mind as he sat alone in a cell beneath the courtroom, awaiting the van that would take him to prison. “I suddenly felt the weight of the choices I’d made. I didn’t regret them, but I did realise that I had played the game and now I would pay the price.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6741f2db7e76583162b2d8f3faa465038f3e19e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6741f2db7e76583162b2d8f3faa465038f3e19e/0_270_5259_3155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Krishna Léger sitting at an outside table at his restaurant, Volver, near Uzès in southern France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Léger at his restaurant, Volver, near Uzès in southern France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Dalmasso/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A court found him guilty of the firearms charge and he spent four months in prisons in Nice and Grasse – his first jail time, which he experienced as an initiation rite, a test he had to pass in order to be fully accepted into the world he had chosen. By then, Léger was in a relationship with a model named Valérie he had met through associates on the Côte d’Azur; she had just given birth to their daughter. His police interrogators tried all kinds of techniques to make him give up his colleagues, he says, even bringing Valérie in and threatening to have the baby, Elyne, taken into care. “I didn’t denounce anyone; none of my associates had any trouble because of me.”</p> <p>On his release in 2002, he was welcomed into the “family”. What rules this family had, he observed scrupulously, and he found his niche at a new, more serious level of crime. In prison he had met some drug traffickers and, despite never having smoked a joint, he now worked those connections. The first operation he took part in involved smuggling 300kg of hashish from Morocco to Spain, crossing the Strait of Gibraltar at dawn in a rigid inflatable boat.</p> <p>Léger graduated to smuggling cocaine and acquired a nickname – <em>l</em><em>e Grand</em>, the Tall One. He started making serious money. Not long after France adopted the currency in 2002, he was a euro millionaire. Still in his early 30s, he moved his family to a villa in Marbella and bought a Porsche Cayenne.</p> <p>It was around then that he began to indulge his passion for food. He had always loved experimenting in the kitchen, he says, but hadn’t always had the resources to dedicate to it. Having known hunger as a teenager, it gave him particular pleasure to cook for friends – finding the ingredients; tweaking classic Spanish recipes such as gazpacho or tortilla – or invite them to restaurants. He loved everything about this new world: the cash, the coke, the women, the bling. “It was my revenge on life.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The role of prison is to separate dangerous people from society, and to work on their re-insertion. But that second part doesn’t exist – it’s a lie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, his luck ran out. It was 2003. He had started travelling to South America to meet the suppliers, and, having crossed the Atlantic in a catamaran with more than a tonne of Venezuelan cocaine in the hold (a record haul for European law enforcement at that time, though <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2021/feb/24/twenty-three-tonnes-of-cocaine-seized-in-europes-biggest-haul\" title=\"\">peanuts</a> now), was off Cádiz on the Spanish coast. The intended recipients had been arrested, and before Léger and his two associates knew what was happening their vessel had been surrounded by police boats.</p> <p>At the trial in February 2005, he was sentenced to 14 years – later reduced to 12 and a half – and fined €10m (calculated as a percentage of the street value of the haul; he never could have paid it, he says, and technically it remains on the books). He passed through a string of Spanish prisons before escaping in 2009 from the Ocaña jail near Madrid by paying off a prison employee. </p> <p>The plan was to retrieve cash that was owed to him, revive his dormant business interests and, as soon as possible, head for South America. His relationship with Valérie hadn’t survived the stretch inside, but they separated amicably. His parting gift to her was a house in Saint-Tropez. And before he left, he wanted to reconnect with his 10-year-old daughter, Elyne. The plan went awry, mainly because his former associates were either dead or in jail, placing his cash out of reach, and he didn’t get away as quickly as he had hoped. In December 2009, in a blur of false papers, motorway hotels and burner phones, he celebrated his 40th birthday.</p> <p>The following September, after he had been a fugitive for 18 months, the police caught up with him again in a layby near Narbonne, close to<strong> </strong>the Spanish border, having tapped his phone. He had been driving in a convoy with two other men, transporting nearly 5kg of cocaine from Spain to France. One of the lawyers who defended him at the trial, which took place three years later in Marseille, found him intelligent, courteous and unusually trustworthy. “In fact, that was one reason he was given a heavy sentence,” Thibaut Rouffiac says. “He wouldn’t trade names.”</p> <p>He got nine years, more than anyone else implicated in the affair, and was shipped off to Les Baumettes. There, he considered another escape, involving the helicopter he had used to transport drugs from Morocco to Spain, but the pilot had been arrested, too – in a Paris hotel room, with a Brazilian sex worker. “End of story,” he says.</p> <p> In total, Léger was sentenced to 21 years, of which he served 13 and a half.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In prison, his passion for food remained a constant, and he did what he could with the single electric plate in his cell and the uninspiring wares at the prison shop. He watched cookery programmes on TV and jotted down recipes in exercise books.</p> <p>At Les Baumettes, he took stock. He was more than 40 years old. His “home” was a filthy, overcrowded, rat-and-cockroach-infested jail where the food was dismal and violence endemic. However, life was bearable for him and his associates, dozens of whom he was thrilled to recognise in the exercise yard, because they were there for organised crime. They had individual cells in one of the less dilapidated buildings, and they ran the place. This meant they could smuggle in any number of desirable items – including fish – from outside, with visitors and prison officers acting as go-betweens.</p> <p>But it was a poor existence whose rhythm was set by the desultory game of cat and mouse the prisoners played with the guards – passing illicit mobile phones from cell to cell, for example, from false shoe sole to tin can, before routine searches. He pitied the officers. “At least I would get out one day.” And all around him were youngsters – mostly black or of north African heritage – who had grown up in poverty and were serving time for minor crimes. Unlike him, they didn’t seem to have chosen their path. He taught some of them to box, watched others radicalise.</p> <p>During his time in Les Baumettes, Léger saw what the anthropologist Didier Fassin observed from his own deep dives into the French justice system. The prison population has more than tripled in the last half-century (the increase has been even greater in the UK and the US) and the main “growth sector” has been minor crime: failure to pay child support, driving without a licence, or possessing small quantities of cannabis. Fassin argued that this punitive turn had been counterproductive, making society less rather than more safe – notably due to high rates of recidivism. “The power to punish has become uncoupled from its rational justification,” he wrote in 2015. Prison had become “senseless”.</p> <p>Léger’s initial response to his penal experiences was simmering resentment, but over the years he managed to put his feelings into words: “The role of prison is, first, to separate dangerous people from society, and second, to work on their reinsertion. But that second part doesn’t exist. In France, at least, it’s a lie.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98bc3479089fe94e96f6b528c4a36998b642d615\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98bc3479089fe94e96f6b528c4a36998b642d615/0_0_3580_3580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Krishna Léger at his restaurant, Volver, near Uzès in southern France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Léger at his restaurant. He trained at Ferrandi, the Harvard of French gastronomy, while still in prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Dalmasso/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When an old friend, Mireille (not her real name), whom he had known growing up in Uzès, paid him a visit, he confided in her that he felt he was wasting his life. In that case, Mireille said, why not change it? “It sounds strange,” Léger says, “but that possibility hadn’t even occurred to me.” When he saw a TV programme about Ferrandi Paris, a cookery school that turns out top chefs, a plan began to form in his mind: to open his own restaurant.</p> <p>Executing this new plan wasn’t easy.<strong> </strong>First he had to get his baccalaureate, which he did after being transferred to a prison in Béziers (considered an escape risk, he was transferred relatively often over the years). Then he had to acquire the computing and administrative skills essential for setting up a business, and finally he had to secure a place at Ferrandi – the <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/m-actu/article/2013/10/24/a-l-ecole-ferrandi-le-harvard-de-la-gastronomie_3501922_4497186.html\" title=\"\">Harvard of French gastronomy</a>, which at that time received at least half a dozen applications for every place on its coveted adult cooking course. Whenever he requested permission to leave the prison for an interview or administrative task, the authorities either refused his request or responded too late. “I understand they aren’t obliged to make life easy for a professional criminal who is doing 20 years and decides he wants to cook,” says Léger, “but when I wanted to rehabilitate myself, all they did was throw a spanner in the works.”</p> <p>Luckily, he had loyal supporters, starting with Mireille, who continued to visit him after his move to Béziers, and eventually became his girlfriend. Though educational opportunities are hard to come by in prison, especially for long-haulers, he had teachers who went the extra mile. One of them, Claude-Emmanuelle Pallo, taught him computer skills at Béziers. She recognised someone with great psychological strength who might actually do something with those skills. But she had an ulterior motive for bringing him into her class, which consisted mainly of mouthy young men. “A profile like his commands respect,” she says. “It calms the troops.”</p> <p>Léger didn’t say much during lessons – he was too busy learning Excel – but when he did, the others listened. The Béziers prison couldn’t have been more different from Les Baumettes. It was new, semi-private, hi-tech and clean. In the prison shop, basic products were more expensive than on the outside. But when the prisoners worked, they were paid less than the minimum wage. “Where is it written that you should make money out of prisoners?” he says. “It’s shameful.”</p> <p>In 2015, he took up a place at Ferrandi – paid for with Mireille’s help. His persistence with the prison authorities had paid off, too; he had managed to get himself transferred to La Santé prison in Paris, from where he could commute. He was in semi-liberty, meaning he was allowed to travel alone, on condition that he returned to his cell each night. Initially his mentors were told only that he was a prisoner; the other students weren’t allowed to know even that. “Our first reaction was, what has he done?” says one of those mentors, chef Jérémy Touzelet. “There were knives in the kitchen. Did we need to count them? Chain them up?”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>At the school, he wore no handcuffs. He mingled with the other students, then returned to a very different milieu at night</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The new student’s unusual name meant that Touzelet could easily Google him. He discovered Léger’s past as a drug lord, but also that he hadn’t been convicted of any violent crimes. It was a relief, of sorts, and that relief soon turned to admiration. Of all the students in his intake, Touzelet says, Léger “was the most talented, the hardest working and the most dedicated”. He graduated top of his class, earning a perfect score for his red mullet accompanied by a black olive and thyme tapenade, ratatouille, rouille sauce and crushed herby potatoes – a dish with unmistakable notes of Marseille.</p> <p>For Léger, that prize was extremely hard-won. The eight months at the school were wonderful in one way – an opportunity to shine doing what he loved – but torture in another.</p> <p>Apart from the shock of encountering a world that had moved on – travelling on trains whose passengers were glued to their phones (had there been a catastrophe?), learning to order fast food from a computer – he found juggling his double life incredibly tough. At the school, he wore no handcuffs or electronic bracelet. He mingled with the other students, listening to them chat about their blameless lives, then returned to a very different milieu at night. “There were times when I no longer knew who I was,” he says.</p> <p>His mentors helped discreetly, allowing him to shower at the school, for example, since his schedule left him no opportunity to do so in prison. And there were moments of comedy, as when the class was required to weigh gelatine to within a gram or two – more accuracy than the average kitchen scales provide. “I let slip: ‘We need a dealer’s scales,’” says Touzelet, “then swore inwardly and glanced at Krishna. But he took it well. He understood it was the price he had to pay for being treated naturally.” Nevertheless, it was a liberation in more ways than one when, in 2016, he got parole along with his diploma.</p> <p>Touzelet recommended him to a colleague who worked as a second to the Parisian chef Guy Savoy. She, in turn, recommended him to Rémy Doridam, who was setting up a bar in Paris specialising in artisanal beers. Impressed, Doridam gave him his first paid role running a kitchen: “There were people who didn’t like beer who came every lunchtime for Kris’s cooking.”</p> <p>He had dreamed of opening a restaurant in Paris, and calling it Les Baumettes. But Paris was expensive and he found himself drawn back to the Gard, where diners might not recognise the irony in that name. Banned from the part of France south of the Bordeaux-Lyon axis until his parole ended in 2021, he requested a special dispensation to open a bistro in Uzès. It was only granted because Mireille owned the building that would house the business, which duly launched in January 2018 under the name Caractère. Nine months later, he and Mireille split up. In the short existence of their joint project, it had received a <a href=\"https://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/restaurant/souvenirs-de-vacances-nos-tables-favorites_2032633.html\" title=\"\">glowing write-up</a> from the respected restaurant critic François-Régis Gaudry – who praised Léger’s “inspired pairings”.</p> <p>He found himself, once again, without a home, a job or a girlfriend. Technically, having no permanent address, he was violating the terms of his parole and in danger of being sent back to prison. This was the reason for his wariness when, in late 2018, he met Céline Simitian, the judge who oversaw his parole in Nîmes. Sympathetic to his plight, she ensured that he remained free, and he started again – from scratch.</p> <p>He persuaded a bank to give him a loan – no mean feat given his criminal record – and bought the converted farmhouse that houses Volver<em> </em>for a snip at €32,000, the previous owner having gone bankrupt. He sold his scooter to make up the shortfall, salvaged some of his kitchen equipment from Caractère, and chose, as a name, the Spanish word for “return”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"861c0bf5284d05491ae050d7b5a31b2162dc1fc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/861c0bf5284d05491ae050d7b5a31b2162dc1fc1/0_0_1291_1291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Léger with his daughter, Elyne, in 2003, when she was four\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Léger with his daughter, Elyne, in 2003, when she was four</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Elyne Léger</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since he wasn’t yet allowed to own a business in the region, he created a holding company for Volver,<em> </em>with his daughter Elyne – now in her early 20s – as managing director. Less than a year after the restaurant opened its doors, Covid struck. Léger tightened his belt, and once the first lockdown had been lifted, chalked up a stunning summer season. “Elegant and precise,” is how one fan, Yves, describes his cooking. “He often uses quite humble and local ingredients,” says another, Arline: “squash, mackerel, squid, lots of fresh vegetables.” The poached egg with mushrooms, herbs and parmesan cream is a reliable hit. People make detours to taste his limoncello baba.</p> <p>Léger is now looking to take on a second in the kitchen, so he can devote some time to his next project: a training centre where former prisoners can learn the basics of the restaurant trade. The idea is to offer them decently paid work, dignity and prospects, while at the same time addressing the shortage of staff in the trade post-pandemic.</p> <p>It is news that delights Simitian. She understands Léger’s anger towards the system she represents. “The problem is obvious,” she says. “When you have to manage a very large number of people, with the means at the disposal of the justice system and rehabilitation services, it’s difficult to tailor those services to individuals.” But she also believes that the system can be a force for good, and that it is people like Léger – who turn their experience into something positive – who make her job worthwhile. She is aware of the paradox in that. “You don’t see people like Krishna every day,” she admits.</p> <p>The paradox isn’t lost on him either. Looking back over his life, he says that the same skills that made him a good firefighter, and a good crime lord – discipline, attention to detail, a certain fearlessness – make him a good chef, too. And, though he considers the justice system unfit for purpose, he also acknowledges that it is the reason he is talking to me in his own restaurant today. He deserved his punishment, he says, and he paid his debt. Anyone can taste the results.<strong> </strong></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/20/when-the-sun-sets-there-is-this-incredible-pink-thomas-jordans-best-phone-picture","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T09:00:35Z","webTitle":"‘When the sun sets, there is this incredible pink’: Thomas Jordan’s best phone picture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/20/when-the-sun-sets-there-is-this-incredible-pink-thomas-jordans-best-phone-picture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/20/when-the-sun-sets-there-is-this-incredible-pink-thomas-jordans-best-phone-picture","fields":{"headline":"‘When the sun sets, there is this incredible pink’: Thomas Jordan’s best phone picture","trailText":"The US-based photographer on finding a warm, quiet moment in West Chicago","byline":"Grace Holliday","body":"<p>Thomas Jordan was faced with a problem.

About juicy flies, about humans, about anything at all?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/13/why-do-many-animals-snore\">Why do many animals snore?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A US-European research partnership suggests that thousands of species of jumping spiders might <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2204754119#sec-2\">experience rapid eye movement stages of sleep</a>. That is the state in which humans have their most vivid dreams, though the study in question stops well short of concluding that spiders have dreams.</p> <p>The team from universities in Germany, Italy and Harvard University in the US observed the arachnids during night-time inactivity using infrared cameras, and it found “periodic bouts of retinal movements coupled with limb twitching and stereotyped leg curling”.</p> <p>While the researchers are not spinning a tale that spiders were definitely experiencing anything close to human-like patterns of sleep, they said, it did leave them “begging the deeper question of whether jumping spiders may be experiencing visual dreams”.</p> <p>“They were just uncontrollably twitching in a way that really looked a lot like when dogs or cats dream and have their little REM phases,” Daniela Rößler, a biologist at Germany’s University of Konstanz and the study’s lead author, <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spiders-seem-to-have-rem-like-sleep-and-may-even-dream1/\">told Scientific American</a>.</p> <p>“Whether that means that they’re visually experiencing this similar to how we experience visual dreams is a completely different story,” she said in a separate interview with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/08/15/jumping-spiders-rem-sleep-study/\">the Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>She suggested the spiders could be experiencing dreams “through vibrations”.</p> <p>The group’s findings were <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2204754119#sec-2\">published this month</a> in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a peer reviewed journal of the National Academy of Sciences.</p> <p>Rößler said the study of REM sleep is still largely centered on terrestrial vertebrates, particularly mammals and birds, with research into insects and arachnids rare.</p> <p>“Movable eyes have evolved only in a limited number of lineages, an adaptation notably absent in insects and most terrestrial arthropods,” the study notes.</p> <p>“Jumping spiders, however, possess movable retinal tubes to redirect gaze.”</p> <p>Lisa Taylor, research scientist at the University of Florida’s department of entomology, and an <a href=\"https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/news/2022/05/11/inside-the-mind-of-a-spider/\">expert in the behavior and cognitive abilities of jumping spiders</a>, said it was possible to believe the spiders were asleep.</p> <p>“They have pretty good cognitive abilities,” said Taylor, who is not connected with the study. “They are very active in the day, they’re constantly moving, constantly getting information from their eyes, they also have tiny hairs around their bodies, and pick up vibrations and can hear.</p> <p>“So there’s a lot of cool stuff going on in their brains, then they climb into their little silk nests at night. They have to process all this information, so it wouldn’t be surprising if they might be doing something like that at night.”</p> <p>Taylor added: “I often wonder if spiders have dreams, and what they might dream about. But that’s something that might be better left to artists.”</p> <p>The researchers stress that before they can address whether spiders have dreams, they first must prove they are actually sleeping, which they intend to work on in the future. But they say the evidence they’ve seen so far suggested it was possible.</p> <p>“Given the regularity of twitches and leg curls and their co-occurrence with retinal movements, both movement types appeared to be different expressions of the same active sleep–like phase,” they said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/20/solar-panels-how-to-fix-your-energy-bills-while-the-sun-shines","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T09:00:35Z","webTitle":"Solar panels: how to fix your energy bills while the sun shines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/20/solar-panels-how-to-fix-your-energy-bills-while-the-sun-shines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/20/solar-panels-how-to-fix-your-energy-bills-while-the-sun-shines","fields":{"headline":"Solar panels: how to fix your energy bills while the sun shines","trailText":"Demand goes through the roof as struggling British households try to tackle soaring electricity prices","byline":"Patrick Collinson","body":"<p>British households are racing to install roof-top solar electricity panels amid huge energy price rises, with installers saying demand has “exploded”.</p> <p>Simon Dudson, the chief executive of the Little Green Energy Company, which serves London and south-east England, says: “It’s absolutely crazy times. It’s unprecedented. We have had a 400-500% increase in business.”</p> <p>The soaring price of electricity means a domestic solar panel system can now pay for itself in as little as seven years, and the way things are going, that could go down to five years. About a year ago, installers were saying the “payback” period was 15 years or more. Then there are the environmental benefits of solar panels.</p> <p>But don’t expect to have a system installed by your first-choice company this side of winter. The increase in demand, plus supply problems – about 90% of panels are made in China – mean some installers are warning customers of delays stretching out 10 months or more.</p> <p>Sussex Solar, like many installers across the UK, this week had a blunt message on its website. “We are very sorry but due to an unprecedented level of interest in solar panels and heat pumps, we are unable to accept any new inquiries for the time being. We will reopen our contact page towards the end of August …”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The supply chain is the thing that is holding us all back</p> <footer> <cite>The Little Green Energy Company’s Simon Dudson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sussex Solar’s director, Amanda Baxter, adds: “It’s absolutely mad at the moment.”</p> <p>The Solar Shed, based near King’s Lynn in Norfolk, had a similar message: “Thanks for getting this far. We’re not taking any new inquiries at present. Sorry. The contact us page will open again when we clear the backlog.”</p> <p>Many reputable installers say they won’t start taking inquiries again until September – but could close again at any time.</p> <p>“The supply chain is the thing that is holding us all back,” Dudson says. “The main issue six months ago was the shortage of skilled labour. Now it’s the global shortage of stock. The panel manufacturers are telling us they shifted as much in the first quarter of this year as they did for the whole of last year.”</p> <p>So if you want to have any chance of getting panels on your roof, you will need to act soon. Keep a close eye on firms’ websites, and also be aware that the prices of panels and batteries are on the march upwards after many years of decline.</p> <h2><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></h2> <p>As little as £6,000 and up to £20,000 for a large house.</p> <p>It all depends on the size of the system (measured in kilowatts), the battery (optional, and can double the price), the diverter (to feed electricity to your immersion water heater), and whether you choose to install an electric vehicle charger at the same time. “Premium” panels and batteries (such as Tesla’s) cost more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cf78d9b0534992ec44058bc3a290aa652a5e6db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cf78d9b0534992ec44058bc3a290aa652a5e6db/52_388_7818_4690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Equipment with solar panels or solar cells on the roof of a house\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The prices of solar panels and batteries are rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EyeEm/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Is it worth it?</strong></h2> <p>A 4kW system, suitable for the average home, should generate about 3,500kWh (kilowatt hours) of electricity a year across much of England.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the average 28p unit price of electricity a kWh means the 3,500 kWh produced is worth £980. So if you paid £7,000 for an installation, it’s paying for itself in about seven years.</p> <p>However, the 28p unit price is expected to leap to 45p or more this winter. That would mean the value of electricity produced by a 4kW system would rise to £1,575 or more – suggesting solar panels could pay for themselves in as little as five years.</p> <p>But electricity unit prices could fall back, while the costs of the panels and installation are likely to rise, possibly steeply, so there are no guarantees.</p> <h2><strong>Will it supply all my electricity? And heat my water?</strong></h2> <p>The typical bungalow or detached home in the UK uses about 4,100 kWh a year, so panels producing 3,500 kWh a year will cover much of your usage.</p> <p>You will want to change your electricity usage habits to make the most use of your panels. That means running appliances such as the dishwasher during the day, not at night.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"74b601d1746564f6421440d7b3003b31ff91a150\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74b601d1746564f6421440d7b3003b31ff91a150/596_0_2837_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Water pours from a tap in a home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"858\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Have you thought about tapping into solar power?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A diverter can send any surplus energy generated by solar PV panels to an immersion heater. Installers say this is now a better option than having separate solar hot water panels. They cost about £500.</p> <h2><strong>Should I buy the battery?</strong></h2> <p>A battery will store the solar energy produced – but not used – during the day and let you use it at night.</p> <p>On a sunny day, many households will struggle to use half the electricity produced by the panels, so a battery sounds like a very good idea – except they are costly. Kevin Holland of the Solar Shed says: “You can almost double the cost of the installation by opting for a battery.”</p> <p>The batteries cost £5,000 upwards – if you can find one. Installers say they are the most difficult thing to source at the moment.</p> <h2><strong>Can I sell surplus electricity back to the National Grid?</strong></h2> <p>The “feed-in tariffs” that kickstarted the UK’s domestic solar industry have long gone. They were extremely lucrative, initially paying households 43.3p for every unit of electricity. But the rate was subsequently cut, then completely axed in 2019.</p> <p>There is a rather less lucrative replacement scheme called the <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/smart-export-guarantee-seg\">Smart Export Guarantee</a>. The big electricity companies set their own SEG rate – and most pay just a few pence. At the time of writing, the best-paying was Octopus Energy at 7.5p/kWh, with the next best at only 5p/kWh.</p> <p>Octopus also operates a tariff where what customers are paid varies every half-hour, according to day-ahead wholesale prices. Earlier this year customers in London were picking up £1.29 for every unit sent back to the grid.</p> <p>“We choose to give these best-in-market rates on our tariffs because we know that our future energy system will need to include lots of small generators and homes with their own energy sources, too,” an Octopus spokesperson says.</p> <h2><strong>Is my home right for solar panels?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0da7d76be26005158d85afa4c9aeef617a29daa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0da7d76be26005158d85afa4c9aeef617a29daa4/26_212_4503_2702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Side view of large solar panel on roof at sunset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You will want to change your electricity usage habits to make the most use of your solar panels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxshoto/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A south-facing roof, sloping at a 30-degree angle, is best. East- and west-facing panels will produce about 15% to 20% less electricity.</p> <p>The good news is that advances in solar technology mean you need less roof space than 10 years ago to produce the same amount of electricity. You will generally need at least 20 sq metres of usable roof space.</p> <p>Solar panels do not require planning permission but you will need listed building consent to put solar panels on a listed building. If you live in a conservation area, you will also need to contact your local council before going ahead.</p> <h2><strong>In a heatwave, do solar panels really pump out the electricity?</strong></h2> <p>Not really. What’s important is the intensity of light. Many experts say the panels actually work better at a temperature of 23C to 25C. Scorching weather is good for thermal water solar systems but not for maximising output from photovoltaic cells.</p> <p>“If you compare a 4kW system in Madrid with one in London, on a perfectly clear day you will get more electricity from the one in London,” Holland says.</p> <h2><strong>Can I get a grant?</strong></h2> <p>Not at the moment. In 2013, the government’s green deal offered loans to help households buy solar panels but it ended in 2015 and there is no funding available for solar panels now.</p> <p>One option is to apply to your bank for a home improvement loan. At HSBC, a £10,000 loan secured against your home would cost £183 a month over five years, with an APR of 3.9%.</p> <h2><strong>Will the panels last?</strong></h2> <p>The early adopters of solar panels report generally good news on this front, with the panels requiring little maintenance, and new ones expected to last up to 40 years.</p> <p>Their efficiency declines over time – but only slowly. Batteries decline faster and may have to be replaced after 10 years.</p> <h2><strong>Aren’t they all just </strong><strong>double-glazing cowboys?</strong></h2> <p>“There are still a fair amount of cowboys in the industry,” Sussex Solar’s Baxter says.</p> <h2><strong>So how do you find a reputable installer?</strong></h2> <p>Word of mouth is your best bet.</p> <p>Ask around on your local street WhatsApp forums.

It has produced about 2,700 kW hours (kWh) a year – enough for more than 80% of his annual electricity needs – and 15 years later it is still going strong.</p> <p>“The panels are supposed to degrade by about 0.5% a year but they have not. I’d estimate they have declined by no more than 0.25% a year,” he says.</p> <p>“The newer panels are now more efficient. A 3kW roof system now needs less roof space than we needed back in 2007. You can now get a 4kW system in the space needed for a 3kW system years ago.”</p> <p>Seager spent £8,500 on his panels, and they have more than repaid his investment. “Even before prices for electricity shot up we were getting a return of 10% to 15% per annum on the roof panels.”</p> <p>Seager benefited from the government’s “feed-in tariffs” paid to early adopters, which are no longer available. He now thinks the government was overly generous: “They set the tariff so high, there was a massive return on the investment.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbdc7d1be4886702f51ec101c9a9cbc1d7278bb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbdc7d1be4886702f51ec101c9a9cbc1d7278bb3/0_245_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley Seager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashley Seager says: ‘Even before prices for electricity shot up we were getting a return of 10% to 15% per annum on the roof panels.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/Ashley Seager, solar entrepreneur</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the falling cost and higher efficiency of the panels since 2007, combined with today’s soaring electricity prices, mean that the financial equation for fitting solar panels still stacks up without any government subsidies.</p> <p>His company, <a href=\"http://sun4net.co.uk/\">Sun4net</a>, focuses on installing panels on commercial rooftop spaces. But, like everyone else in the industry, he warns of the difficulty in obtaining supplies.</p> <p>“We are busier than ever but it continues a strong upward trend that we saw after Cop26 [the 2021 UN climate change conference]. The value of the projects has really gone through the roof, so to speak. But anyone in the domestic panels business who says they have much stock is not telling you the truth.”</p> <p>He estimates that about 95% of all panels come from China. Its government heavily subsidised its solar PV industry, which helped bring down prices but also drove manufacturers in Europe and North America to the wall.</p> <p>Now, as Europe wakes up to its overdependence on Russian gas, it is realising it has an even greater dependence on China to supply solar panels.</p> <h2>‘My aim is to be off-grid as much as possible in the summer’</h2> <p>Norfolk homeowner Stephen Beardmore says he has just spent £14,500 on a complete home solar system – including panels, battery, diverter and car charger.</p> <p>He made the move not only because of recent electricity price rises but because “for me, it was always the right thing to do”.</p> <p>Beardmore, who works for the Royal Air Force, says: “I’ve been thinking about it for the last two years.

It felt like I was walking into a dodgy car sales agency,” Beardmore says.</p> <p>Friends recommended the Solar Shed in nearby King’s Lynn. “My aim is to be off-grid as much as possible in the summer. I agreed a 16-panel, 405W-per-panel system, with an 11kW battery. And I put a car charger in at the same time, even though I don’t have an electric car yet. For me, it’s about a change in lifestyle and the way you use power.”</p> <p>As part of his research, he calculated his household’s overall electricity usage before the panels were installed, which added up to 4,300 kWh over 2021.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After the scaffolder came in, the whole thing only took two days</p> <footer> <cite>Stephen Beardmore</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“They have only been up for six weeks but I’m completely happy with them.

In Scotland, the same is true for children in primary one to five. In Wales, universal free school meals are being rolled out from September, beginning with children in reception, and by 2024 every primary school pupil will receive one.</p> <p>Families with low incomes can apply for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals\" title=\"\">free school meals</a> – and any child who is eligible can also take part in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/holiday-activities-and-food-programme/holiday-activities-and-food-programme-2021\" title=\"\">holiday activities and food programme</a>, offering activity clubs and a hot meal.</p> <p>For children who do pay for school meals, prices vary across the country. One primary school in Bristol charges £2.30, while in Leicester meals cost £2.35 in primary school and £2.55 in secondary school.

It’s exactly the fun-packed approach you need for this kind of travel show","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","body":"<p>It is a tough time for the TV travel show. It feels like a relic of a distant age, like Babycham or job security. For starters, the role of the travelogue has changed. In the evolving cultural climate, we have started to accept that simply pointing and staring at other countries and their inhabitants is no longer good enough. Throughout the era of cheap flights, when it was possible to nab a £20 seat on a plane to Pisa for the weekend to see the leaning tower, there was less call for an unqualified famous person to appear on our screens and explain why it was wonky. And let’s not even get started on the climate and the environmental impact of long-distance travel. You can see why it might be getting harder for the travelogue to thrive.</p> <p>There are plenty of series trying to find a workaround, from many different angles. There’s the grand, trad adventurer, crossing continents on foot while properly engaging with geopolitical issues. There’s the ultra-local, slowburn BBC Four-type of series, in which a presenter goes for a lovely stroll, or a swim, or sails a barge, and chats to the camera about their lovely thoughts and lovely feelings. And then there’s the comedian-led approach, which mostly treats the holiday as a washing line on which to peg its sun-warmed jokes. The destination is fine, a source of passing interest, but it will never really be the star.</p> <p>Rosie Jones’ Trip Hazard (23 August, 10pm, Channel 4) is in that last camp, though very much without the sun. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/mar/30/rosie-jones-i-hope-disabled-people-can-see-me-on-tv-and-think-if-she-can-do-it-i-can-do-it\">comedian</a> and “national liability” visits various British destinations within a reasonable budget and tears around the place generally causing chaos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13aca67e984b44e9b5c6d63d6498b76ee8234d88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13aca67e984b44e9b5c6d63d6498b76ee8234d88/0_46_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosie Jones and Joe Wilkinson in Whitby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosie Jones and Joe Wilkinson in Whitby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Brammall/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having done the Lake District, Whitby, Norwich and Anglesey, Jones begins this second run in Moray, Scotland. There are more episodes than series one, and each is longer, plus it has added Joanna Lumley as narrator, which is a nice touch – as if one travel presenter is waving to another.</p> <p>Jones’s companion is presenter and Strictly almost-finalist AJ Odudu, and the pair have big “hen do for an outdoorsy bride” energy. It looks like a lot of fun, though perhaps less so for the guides showing them how to do things. They try clay pigeon shooting – there are plenty of gags about a woman with cerebral palsy being handed a shotgun – and whisky tasting, and they row across a loch, or part of it, and visit an eco-village where they make clay pots, or at least try to, and then they climb a mountain. It has the feel of a very British holiday, in that it’s often pouring it down and nobody really wants to be there, but everyone is going to make the bloody best of it, OK, because the queue to go through security at the airport now extends into the long-stay car park and the Airbnb was non-refundable and it was either this or glamping at the pig farm down the road, so shut up and eat your packed lunch in the car.</p> <p>It’s messy and chaotic and silly, and it certainly doesn’t skimp on fun. They get the giggles over whisky (“sausage roll” is not, it turns out, a tasting note), and lose the plot over the pottery wheel, when every sentence uttered by their poor potter is caressed into a euphemism. I will never be able to watch the Great British Pottery Throwdown without thinking of their faces at the suggestion that they “stabilise the rim”. Though the general idea is that they will take on challenges, the biggest challenge of the whole episode turns out to be when the owner of the eco-village tries to get them to be silent in the “quiet garden”, where residents usually go to meditate.</p> <p>The danger of taking this tone – naughty kids at the back of the class – is that it might seem sneery, but this pulls off a tricky double-hander. It is frank about the slightly grey rubbishness of certain UK holidays and the things we do to make them entertaining, while also celebrating these traditions and activities with unfettered, slightly unhinged glee, from the good parts to the bad. It feels like a very honest postcard from a sensible summer break. At the end, Odudu and Jones do eventually climb their mountain (“I thought it would be more of a big hill”) and reach the summit, only for the weather to turn so spectacularly that they barely have a view of their own hands, let alone any picture-perfect scenery. It is a highly relatable ending.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/aug/20/scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-covid-omicron-cost-of-living-john-barilaro-fannie-bay-byelection-gunner","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T07:46:29Z","webTitle":"Greens question governor general’s ‘non-disclosure’ of Morrison powers – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/20/scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-covid-omicron-cost-of-living-john-barilaro-fannie-bay-byelection-gunner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/20/scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-covid-omicron-cost-of-living-john-barilaro-fannie-bay-byelection-gunner","fields":{"headline":"Greens question governor general’s ‘non-disclosure’ of Morrison powers – as it happened","trailText":"Albanese government awaits legal advice from solicitor general over former prime minister’s power grab.

A New Age-spouting, barefoot business messiah, he managed to build and burn his last startup, the office-sharing company WeWork, in such spectacular fashion that even Hollywood paid attention.</p> <p>And now he is back – on a quest to become America’s biggest landlord.</p> <p>Neumann, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/adam-neumann-wework-founder-bounces-back-with-flow-a-1bn-property-project\">reported this week</a>, is at the helm of a new company looking to reinvent apartment living. Details are sketchy but the company, called Flow, aims to address the world’s housing crisis with “community-driven” rentals – so basically WeWork for renters.</p> <p>Flow is off to a flying start after receiving one of the most sought-after blessings a new venture could get from Silicon Valley: an $350m investment from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, known as A16Z.</p> <p>The announcement of the firm’s investment in Flow, which values the “pre-seed” company – meaning it has not yet launched – at $1bn rocked the startup world. Not only is it A16Z’s biggest single investment in a venture yet, but it is also a sizable endorsement of Neumann, who has become an entrepreneurial antihero.

This week he described Neumann as “a visionary leader” who had revolutionised commercial real estate and was ready for his next adventure.</p> <p>“It’s often under-appreciated that only one person has fundamentally redesigned the office experience and led a paradigm-changing global company in the process: Adam Neumann,” Andreessen wrote in a <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/08/15/investing-in-flow/\">blogpost</a>. “We understand how difficult it is to build something like this and we love seeing repeat-founders build on past successes by growing from lessons learned.</p> <p>“For Adam, the successes and lessons are plenty.”</p> <p>Neumann kept a low public profile in the years since leaving WeWork, but he has slowly been making more appearances. In November, he appeared at a New York Times’ DealBook summit where he said WeWork’s growth “went to my head”.</p> <p>“I’ve had a lot of time to think, and there have been multiple lessons and multiple regrets,” he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/business/dealbook/adam-neumann-wework.html\">said</a>.</p> <p>In the spring, he spoke to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42c8644e-240e-45a8-954d-31d58e036dec\">Financial Times</a> about his new ambitions, including the then-not-yet-named Flow and his new role as an investor in startups. Through his family office, Neumann invests in more than 45 startups and has over 50 employees, according to the Financial Times.</p> <p>“The opportunity is tremendous,” Neumann told the newspaper about his new idea. “We started by buying this real estate, but then I started walking the buildings, just feeling, and it felt like there’s so much more that could be done to make these tenants’ lives better.</p> <p>“It felt like, frankly, there’s room for more community.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe8b29b7af49aef66753f7910740a75dcc634a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe8b29b7af49aef66753f7910740a75dcc634a0/0_498_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘For Adam, the successes and lessons are plenty.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘For Adam, the successes and lessons are plenty.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VCG/Visual China Group/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even before he came out publicly with his idea for Flow, a report from the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-co-founder-adam-neumann-is-becoming-an-apartment-mogul-11641292207\">Wall Street Journal</a> in January revealed Neumann had quietly bought 4,000 apartments, valued at more than $1bn, in large metropolitan areas in the Sunbelt, including Miami, Atlanta and Nashville. Neumann had started telling friends and associates that he was looking to build a company that would create branded apartments that come with amenities. One of the apartments in Nashville has a saltwater pool and a dog park.</p> <p>There is no arguing that the US has a housing crisis. Lack of supply and soaring prices have made home ownership unaffordable for many and rents have risen sky-high.</p> <p>As Neumann has pointed out: “If you stopped construction today, you [would] run out of homes in less than two months. Crazy, huh?”</p> <p>Andreessen, too, sees the need for more housing, just not in his back yard. In a 2020 <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/\">essay</a> on his vision of the future titled “It’s Time to Build”, Andreessen proclaimed: “We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they?”</p> <p>“We can’t build enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential – which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future,” he wrote.</p> <p>Despite this declaration, it is unlikely that Flow’s first apartment will be in Atherton, California, Andreessen’s upmarket neighbourhood. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/marc-andreessens-opposition-housing-project-nimby/671061/\">the Atlantic</a> reported that Andreessen and his wife, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, sent a public comment laced with all-caps words against zoning for multifamily housing development in Atherton.</p> <p>An effort to increase the housing supply in the area would “MASSIVELY decrease our home values, the quality of life of ourselves and our neighbors and IMMENSELY increase the noise pollution and traffic,” they wrote.</p> <p>And it’s not just housing advocates who have rolled their eyes at Flow. A16Z is coming under criticism for giving a sizable backing to Neumann as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/women-founders-raised-just-2-of-venture-capital-money-last-year?sref=fqqmZ8gi\">women</a> and <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/diversity/disparity-startup-funding-minority-founders-chisos-capital/\">Black and Hispanic</a> founders struggle to get funding. Recent data has shown that as little as 2% of venture capital funds in recent years have gone to underrepresented founders.</p> <p>“This is disgusting,” tweeted Kate Brodock, CEO of Switch and a general partner at the W Fund. “A16Z’s largest check going to a (straight white male) founder of one of the most toxic companies we’ve seen. Firms like this perpetuate over and over again a traditional system that favors a small, homogenous set of founders.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Just_Kate/status/1559201097029677057\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THIS IS DISGUSTING.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@a16z</a>’s largest check going to a (straight white male) founder of one of the most toxic companies we’ve seen.

Neumann is an example of the norm, rather than an exception, in venture capital.</p> <p>“At the end of the day, we as VCs are essentially money managers – we’re glorified financial advisers. We take money from rich people or groups that have large pockets of capital, and our job is to make them more money,” Conwell, who is Black, said. “Our job is not necessarily to care about ethics, morality, systemic racism or financial inequalities. There are many VCs who care about that, but that’s not the job.”</p> <p>Despite Neumann’s past, Conwell noted that the founder brought generous returns to early investors of WeWork who sold out before its crash.</p> <p>“From a VC’s perspective, if you were an earlier investor in WeWork, you made a lot of money,” Conwell said. “It’s very common for VCs to reinvest in folks they’ve invested in before, especially those who have made them money. Adam Neumann made a lot of people a lot of money.”<br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/20/elvis-zelenskiy-and-trump-wiggle-best-worst-dancing-world-leaders-sanna-marin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T07:00:33Z","webTitle":"‘Elvis’ Zelenskiy and Trump’s wiggle: the best and worst dancing world leaders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/elvis-zelenskiy-and-trump-wiggle-best-worst-dancing-world-leaders-sanna-marin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/20/elvis-zelenskiy-and-trump-wiggle-best-worst-dancing-world-leaders-sanna-marin","fields":{"headline":"‘Elvis’ Zelenskiy and Trump’s wiggle: the best and worst dancing world leaders","trailText":"As a video shows Finnish PM busting some moves, the Guardian’s dance critic judges other political performers","byline":"Lyndsey Winship","body":"<p>Leaked video of Finland’s Prime minister, Sanna Marin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/supporters-defend-finnish-pm-sanna-marins-right-to-party\">dancing exuberantly</a> has sparked worldwide debate – and highlighted how political leaders have not been shy about showing off their favourite moves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JonOfUs/status/1560362968839225344\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n  <p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">Sanna Marin, wir alle kennen es <a href=\"https://t.co/cPIDUzd9U3\">pic.twitter.com/cPIDUzd9U3</a></p>— Jon Of Us ☀️ (@JonOfUs) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonOfUs/status/1560362968839225344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 18, 2022</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian dance critic Lyndsey Winship casts her eye over their routines and divides the showstoppers from the clodhoppers.</p> \n<h2><strong>Top 3</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>1.

It’s only recently that I realized the greatest sadness isn’t that we’ve lost that diversity. It’s that we don’t even know that we’ve lost that diversity,” says Chris Smith, founder of the Utopian Seed Project.</p> <p>Here’s a look at five crops, beyond rice, wheat and corn, that farmers across the world are now growing in hopes of feeding the planet as it warms:</p> <h2>Amaranth: the plant that survived colonization</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fcff1c91492ff1faf2d141955cc92f92f14fb38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fcff1c91492ff1faf2d141955cc92f92f14fb38/0_204_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twig with amaranth flowers and a heap of seeds on white background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Indigenous farmers have long grown this drought resistant crop, which is now experiencing a resurgence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picture Partners/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From leaf to seed, the entirety of the amaranth plant is edible. Standing up to eight feet tall, amaranth stalks are topped off with red, orange or green seed-filled plumes. Across Africa and Asia, amaranth has long been eaten as a vegetable – whereas Indigenous Americans also ate the plant’s seed: a pseudocereal like buckwheat or quinoa.</p> <p>While amaranth leaves can be sautéed or cooked into a stir-fry, the seed is commonly toasted and then eaten with honey or milk. A complete protein with all nine essential amino acids, amaranth is a good source of vitamins and antioxidants.</p> <p>In the Americas, Spanish colonizers banned the Aztecs and Maya from growing amaranth when they arrived on the continent. However, the plant continued to grow as a weed and many farmers saved amaranth seeds, passing them down for generations, until their descendants were allowed to grow it again.</p> <p>Today, Indigenous farmers in Guatemala, Mexico and the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/06/ancient-grain-amaranth-food-trend-indigenous\">are collaborating to grow</a> this drought-resistant crop. Like fonio, an African grain, amaranth is not a new crop, but one that is experiencing a resurgence as communities adapt to the climate crisis. “Everything that’s new was old once,” said Matthew Blair, a professor at Tennessee State University and co-president of <a href=\"https://amaranthinstitute.org/\">the Amaranth Institute</a>.</p> <p>Amaranth has found its way into European kitchens, with Ukraine coming in as the crop’s largest producer on the continent.</p> <h2>Fonio: the drought-resistant traditional grain</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ae14926036e576a87dd8c2d5551979963c1457c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ae14926036e576a87dd8c2d5551979963c1457c/0_162_5302_3182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A farmer with his back to the camera sprinkles fonio seeds on to brown earth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farmer Jeane Pierre Kamara 49, sows fonio cereal seeds on freshly plowed land along with fellow farmers in the fields of Neneficha, south-eastern Senegal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For thousands of years, farmers across west Africa have cultivated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/07/fonio-indigenous-crops-africa-food-security\">fonio</a> – a kind of millet that tastes like a slightly nuttier couscous or quinoa. Historically, fonio is considered to be Africa’s oldest cultivated cereal and was regarded by some as the <a href=\"https://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046(10)00126-0/fulltext\">food of chiefs and kings</a>. In countries such as Senegal, Burkina Faso and Mali, fonio would be served on holy days, like at weddings and during the month of Ramadan. </p> <p>Today, attention is increasingly focused on fonio <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/07/fonio-indigenous-crops-africa-food-security\">for its resilience and health benefits</a>. As the climate continues to change, fonio’s drought resistance and ability to grow in poor soil has made it a standout crop in water-scarce regions. It also has important nutritional value as a low glycemic, gluten-free grain – making it a good source of amino acids for people with diabetes or gluten intolerance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad342e23639e3f4c3dea05b114bc92ef65646c06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad342e23639e3f4c3dea05b114bc92ef65646c06/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A metal dish containing cooked fonio with shredded chicken.

The Italian company Obà Food helped introduce fonio to the EU in December 2018. And in the US, the Senegalese chef Pierre Thiam sources fonio from the aid organization SOS Sahel for his brand Yolélé, also the name of his cookbook celebrating west African cuisine.</p> <h2>Cowpeas: the fully edible plant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f56a46297d97f2ff978037f9838239ec3b9726f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f56a46297d97f2ff978037f9838239ec3b9726f/0_321_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A farmer stands on a plot of land with plants growing up to her knees, harvesting cowpeas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farmer Amina Guyo harvesting cowpeas on her land in Moyale, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Tato/FAO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1940s, more than 5m acres of cowpeas were grown in the US – the majority, as their name suggests, for hay to feed livestock. But long before cowpeas – also called southern peas or black-eyed peas – came to the Americas, they were grown for human consumption in west Africa. Although cowpea production has declined in the US in recent decades, the crop is hugely important in much of Africa. Nigeria is the world’s largest cowpea producer.</p> <p>As scientists look for alternative crops, Blair said it was important to identify ones where the entire plant is edible. Although historically people have mostly eaten cowpeas’ seeds, the leaves and pods are also a good source of protein.</p> <p>Because cowpeas are highly drought tolerant, they’re also a good candidate as the climate changes. At Tennessee State University, Blair is part of a team studying the introduction of cowpeas to Latin America, as an alternative to beans, like pinto and black beans, with similar flavor profiles that may soon become more difficult to grow.</p> <h2>Taro: adapting the tropical crop for colder climes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd7b20b113dd159c9f93c5ac2b4878d99cbc010a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd7b20b113dd159c9f93c5ac2b4878d99cbc010a/7_0_1362_817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three bunches of taro next to each other on a table.

But as rising temperatures threaten cultivation of the crop in its natural habitat, farmers in the continental US are trying to adapt the tropical perennial to grow as a temperate annual, because it cannot survive the cold of US winters.</p> <p>At the Utopian Seed Project in North Carolina, founder Chris Smith and his team have been experimenting with tropical crops, looking for ways to help the plants survive the winter. Today, they’re growing eight varieties of taro, including ones sourced from Korea, the Philippines, Hawaii, China and Puerto Rico.</p> <p>“We want to introduce taro because we truly believe that that will give us a more secure food system,” Smith says. “But the beautiful byproduct is that that also allows us to engage with foods that are traditionally from either Indigenous or peasant farming communities. And I think it really gives those traditionally underserved populations an opportunity to engage with the food system that they don’t usually get.”</p> <p>Like fonio, amaranth and cowpeas, taro isn’t a new crop – it’s just new to the US food system. Which is why the Utopian Seed Project isn’t just learning how to grow taro, but also teaching people how to cook it. “These crops are just foods that are embedded in cultures around the world in a way that they’re not embedded here,” Smith said. “It takes work to build that community and desire for that crop.”</p> <h2>Kernza: the crop bred for the climate crisis</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01a2ffd6bdbd811379801903f471ed18d2e8e499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01a2ffd6bdbd811379801903f471ed18d2e8e499/0_0_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A field of kernza plants at sunset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kernza ripens in a breeding plot at the Land Institute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Seirer/Scott Seirer for the Land Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many alternative crops are just plants that were grown somewhere else in the world generations ago, others have been cultivated specifically to withstand climate change.</p> <p>In the 1980s, researchers at the Pennsylvania-based Rodale Institute identified a wheat-like grass called intermediate wheatgrass as a perennial cereal crop that could be developed as a substitute for annual grains like wheat. The goal was to minimize the environmental impacts of grain production.</p> <p>In 2019, the Kansas-based Land Institute, a non-profit research organization focused on sustainable agriculture, introduced Kernza, a cereal crop developed from intermediate wheatgrass and trademarked to ensure farmers know they’ve bought seeds from the official breeding program. Although researchers are still working to improve the grain’s yield, farmers in Minnesota, Kansas and Montana are today growing nearly 4,000 acres of Kernza.</p> <p>“Growers immediately understand the benefits of perennials on their landscapes,” said Tessa Peters, director of crop stewardship at the Land Institute, “and for those working in grain-producing areas, Kernza is very appealing.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2022/aug/20/waterproof-mascara-that-doesnt-smudge-clump-clog","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T07:00:33Z","webTitle":" I’ve found a waterproof mascara that can cope | Sali Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/aug/20/waterproof-mascara-that-doesnt-smudge-clump-clog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2022/aug/20/waterproof-mascara-that-doesnt-smudge-clump-clog","fields":{"headline":"Come rain, shine or heatwave, I’ve found a waterproof mascara that can cope","trailText":"It doesn’t smudge, clump or clog, and gives noticeably longer and more fluttery lashes","byline":"Sali Hughes","body":"<p>Somewhere along the line, I took against waterproof mascara through no fault of its own.

His usually profitable company, OA Coffee, one of Estonia’s biggest coffee bean roasting companies, may have posted a loss for the first time last year and is set to do so again this year, but Vaaderpass remains strikingly sanguine as he sits on the terrace of the cafe he also owns on a cobbled street in the old town of Tallinn.</p> <p>The central causes of Vaaderpass’s misfortune is a 240% increase in the price of unroasted green coffee and a 20% surge in the cost of the gas he uses to roast his imported beans. He also felt the need to give his staff a 10% pay rise in January despite the lack of company profits.</p> <p>This is the reality of living in Europe’s inflation hotspot. The latest figures, published on Thursday, showed that Estonia has an annual inflation rate of an astounding 23.2% – the highest in the eurozone, vastly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/29/eurozone-inflation-record-energy-prices-growth\">outpacing the average of 8.9%</a>.</p> <p>Vaaderpass is inevitably part of the cycle. He has raised his price to supermarkets by 25% over the last eight months and he fears he will have to do so again this year. A coffee in his cafe is today half a euro more expensive than it was, and Vaaderpass says he will also have to cut costs to get “back on track”.</p> <p>But he is not on the streets calling for the government’s downfall. No Estonians are. Indeed the latest polling has the Reform party, the largest party in the ruling coalition, flying high with 34.4% of the vote, and their conservative rivals on 21.3%, six months before the national elections.</p> <p>“Estonians are not that temperamental,” Vaaderpass says. “Calm northern people. No emotions, you know. The joke is that when Covid hit and people couldn’t meet, it was a lucky day for Estonians. Celebration day.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"659cd1122f095c7ea4f7fbd9f8c2dcd05af3fd47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/659cd1122f095c7ea4f7fbd9f8c2dcd05af3fd47/0_208_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman picking nectarines at Balti Jaama market in Tallinn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman picking nectarines at Balti Jaama market in Tallinn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of the explanation for the lack of a political backlash may be that Estonian salaries have been on a sharp upward trajectory for several years and the economy recovered well and quickly from the Covid pandemic, leading to labour shortages and higher wages. Voters are relatively relaxed about a temporary period of higher prices, it is suggested.</p> <p>But there is also an understanding in Estonia, once part of the Soviet Union and containing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/jun/23/what-is-stopping-us-becoming-ukraine-20-the-estonian-women-preparing-for-war\">large Russian-language minority</a>, that the war in Ukraine is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/14/russian-war-slowing-growth-and-hiking-inflation-european-commission-warns\">source of many of their problems</a>, says Kaspar Oja, an economist at Estonia’s central bank.</p> <p>“In many countries people have gone to the streets even with lower inflation rates, but here people are quite calm,” he says. “Of course there are people who complain, but most people understand that the increase in energy prices is broadly related to the war and they understand what it is behind it.”</p> <p>There is, however, something percolating, he admits.</p> <p>Estonia’s standout inflation rate is also due to some peculiarities in its economy, and potentially some governmental missteps that may be seized upon. Recent pension reforms have allowed people to dip into their nest eggs to spend now rather than later. A large proportion of consumers are on energy deals that are linked to the market price rather than fixed. </p> <p>And the newspapers are increasingly full of complaints about how Estonian energy producers, with relatively low production costs, are racking up high profits as they raise their prices in line with other regional producers in the Nord Pool exchange via which electricity is shared and prices set. Estonia remains a relatively poor country within the EU, and so energy and food prices make up an oversized part of consumer spending.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-19-02:47:38/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-19-02:47:38/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“Lately there have been more complaints about the electricity because they can see companies have benefited from it,”Oja says. “Consumers are paying more but Estonia has energy producers which are benefiting pretty well and people are not happy about that. That is why the government is planning to have a universal electricity service for small consumers, mostly households, to take effect from October. The electricity companies will have to sell electricity according to the production costs.”</p> <p>It is also, however, starting to be noticed in the media how little the prime minister, Kaja Kallas, who has spoken of the need to keep tight control over spending, has offered in terms of mitigation on energy prices.</p> <p>Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute For International Economics, says the latest inflation figures show that the more interventionist governments, such as the French, with the lowest annual inflation rate in the eurozone at 6.8%, and the Italians (8.4%), have done best in shielding their voters from the inflationary pressures.</p> <p>“The underlying issue is that the Estonians haven’t done very much,” Kirkegaard says. “The French have been largely insulated because of the nuclear production and they haven’t had nearly the same pass through. This is unlikely to last because if you look at the forward energy pricing in France, it is higher than most of the rest of the Europe as the fear is that the river levels are so low that they will have to take the nuclear plants off the grid because they will not have the water to cool them.</p> <p>“But the government has done quite a lot. They have nationalised EDF [the country’s largest energy company] fully and it will do what the government wants. They have also raised public benefits to low-wage people by up to 10% to basically try to mitigate the cost of living <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/09/cost-of-living-crisis-europe-britain-energy-bills-rishi-sunak\">for low-income groups</a>.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1129ad5682dbd279ee3e891de2e3b01da181c990\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1129ad5682dbd279ee3e891de2e3b01da181c990/0_208_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baristas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baristas Elizabeth Liiv (left) and Anastasia Kralle at OA Coffee cafe say the understand why prices are rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The link between lower inflation rates and intervention should not be lost on Boris Johnson’s successor in the UK, Kirkegaard suggests. According to data released by the Office for National Statistics this week, consumer price inflation in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\">jumped to 10.1% in July,</a> the highest since February 1982, making it the first major economy to see price growth hit double digits.</p> <p>“My sense is that the UK when it comes to fiscal transfers or direct government help hasn’t done much compared to the continent, certainly southern Europe and France and the pass through of costs has been much larger,” he says. “I would say the UK is one of the least activist major governments.”</p> <p>It is yet to be seen whether British voters will be as relaxed as those in Estonia. In central Tallinn, Lisa, 34, a psychotherapist picking up some fruit at the covered Balti Jaama Turg market, says she is buying fewer cosmetics and opting for secondhand clothes over new ones, but is more concerned about the fate of Russians and Ukrainians than that of the Estonian economy. “I feel sad about that rather than angry,” she says. </p> <p>Anastasia Kralle, 21, and Elizabeth Liiv, 17, serving at the OA Coffee cafe, agree. “I have noticed the price of eggs keeps on going up, every time I go to the shops,” laughs Kralle. “Yes, everything is more expensive, but I don’t want to be angry. I am not blaming anyone, we all know why it is happening.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/19/how-the-nrl-played-politics-and-emerged-as-the-big-winner-from-grand-final-stoush","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T06:58:05Z","webTitle":"How the NRL played politics and emerged as the big winner from grand final stoush | Nick Tedeschi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/how-the-nrl-played-politics-and-emerged-as-the-big-winner-from-grand-final-stoush","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/19/how-the-nrl-played-politics-and-emerged-as-the-big-winner-from-grand-final-stoush","fields":{"headline":"How the NRL played politics and emerged as the big winner from grand final stoush ","trailText":"The league has successfully managed to manoeuvre into a strong position that will serve it well for years to come","byline":"Nick Tedeschi","body":"<p>After a month of posturing, positioning, politicking and publicity-hunting, the NRL has agreed to stage the 2022 NRL grand final in Sydney with Accor Stadium to host the decider for the 23rd time. It was long assumed the showpiece event would return to Sydney this season after Covid forced the 2021 title decider to Brisbane, but when politics and sport collided over the issue, all bets were off.</p> <p>The origins of this trace back to the fall of Gladys Berejiklian as NSW premier. Her government had promised the NRL $800m in funding to upgrade four suburban venues. That promise came on the back of a deal to not proceed with a planned upgrade of the Sydney Olympic stadium that was initially tied into a plan that would also see the Sydney Football Stadium rebuilt. The new Moore Park venue, which has been completed at a cost of $828m is due to open in two weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/18/nrl-grand-final-to-be-played-in-sydney-ending-nsw-and-queensland-battle-for-event\">NRL grand final to be played in Sydney, ending NSW and Queensland battle for event</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Berejiklian’s successor Dominic Perrottet took a different view on stadium funding and advised ARLC chair Peter V’landys that funding for suburban ground upgrades would no longer be a priority for the government. This came after an April meeting that saw $300m in funding for an upgrade to Penrith Stadium – located in Ayres’ seat – locked in.</p> <p>Funding for the remaining three venues – Leichhardt Oval, Brookvale Oval and Cronulla’s Shark Park – would be redirected to flood rebuilding efforts, a decision V’landys said “was using the human floods to spin it”. Leichhardt Oval had a railing collapse days after it was revealed the state would be deferring any funding for an upgrade.</p> <p>The stoush became very public in early August and created significant uncertainty as to where the 2022 grand final would be played. It also, by design or by accident, provided a new revenue stream for the NRL and a template by which future grand final venues would be decided.</p> <p>V’landys retaliated to the tearing up of an arrangement with the NSW government dating back to 2018 that would keep the season decider in Sydney until 2042 – a failure “to honour an agreement”, according to the ARLC chair. It was a stick wielded publicly and often during recent negotiations as the NRL opened talks with the Queensland government to stage the game at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium.</p> <p>Nothing drives a price north more than competitive tension and V’landys created it by turning Queensland into a legitimate player. Leaks suggested that the grand final would move to Brisbane. Even in announcing Sydney as the winner, V’landys declared that “media reports that were giving out that Queensland were favourites were on the mark”. It was not until NSW offered a figure believed to be in the region of $8m at the last minute that the NRL gave the game to Sydney.</p> <p>Victory for the NRL was not just a cash hit in an environment where the government is looking to shift money away from sports funding. It also opened the door to sell to the highest bidder each year in a situation V’landys likened to the Super Bowl, ensuring the NRL gets a significant cash injection along with leverage over state governments to ensure rugby league projects receive ongoing funding.</p> <p>The NRL managed to extract millions of extra dollars for a product that had not changed, and as V’landys was at pains to stress “this is only for one year”. An incredibly astute political player who has a long history of winning clashes over both change and money, V’landys has created a landscape where state governments could potentially throw significant sums at the NRL on an annual basis, knowing that failure to do so could have very real electoral consequences, at least in traditional rugby league states.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/former-nrl-star-corey-norman-gets-eight-match-ban-for-hand-between-buttocks\">Former NRL star Corey Norman gets eight-match ban for ‘hand between buttocks’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pressure is building on Perrottet to take further funding away from rugby league projects – such as the confirmed Penrith Stadium upgrade – but given how the last four months have played out and the potential ramifications of losing most favoured nation status with the NRL, it is unlikely to be a fight the chastened premier will seek out.</p> <p>Even in victory, V’landys could not help but rub Perrottet’s nose in his political loss, saying: “Dom is a very good premier, a very good human being, but don’t have a bet with him because if you win he won’t pay.” It was a throwaway line but one that speaks to where power resides in this stoush. The game has changed and rugby league is unquestionably the winner.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 August 2022 to remove the incorrect statement that Stuart Ayres was the minister for sport when the Berejiklian government promised the stadium funding.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/aug/20/graeme-souness-mans-game-comments-chelsea-spurs","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T06:55:40Z","webTitle":"Graeme Souness’s careless comments meant his point got lost in translation | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/20/graeme-souness-mans-game-comments-chelsea-spurs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/aug/20/graeme-souness-mans-game-comments-chelsea-spurs","fields":{"headline":"Graeme Souness’s careless comments meant his point got lost in translation","trailText":"The TV pundit’s clumsy discussion of a ‘man’s game’ obscured an interesting observation about the theatre of aggression","byline":"Barney Ronay","body":"<p>It is one of the most reliable features of modern life that any piece of news, no matter how banal, must inspire an instant and violently polarised public response.</p> <p>In its simplest form this boils down to the standard opposition of snowflakes and gammons.

And it was there again at the weekend in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/graeme-souness-criticised-mans-game-premier-league-chelsea-tottenham\">comments from Graeme Souness on Sky Sports</a> after Chelsea v Spurs, that weird interlude where suddenly Souness was talking about the man’s game, about men going at it with men, about getting our game back; stuff that, even as he was saying it, made you want to reach into the screen and place a hand over his chiselled, grizzled jowls, to feel the iconic abrasion of the Souness moustache, and to say No, Graeme, this is not it.</p> <p>This is not the incredibly ill-thought-out hill you should be so ready to die on. Even if you do seem incredibly keen on the basic idea of dying on a hill.</p> <p>I don’t know what Souness was trying to express. I am biased in his favour because I admired him as a footballer (for those who weren’t there: he was a genuinely A-list central midfielder) and I find him watchable and very funny as a TV pundit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30f957328c1891b6edc8eaeb268b287aebf60796\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30f957328c1891b6edc8eaeb268b287aebf60796/0_41_2772_1663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel in a heated argument after Sunday’s match between Chelsea and Tottenham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel in a heated argument after Sunday’s match between Chelsea and Tottenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What does he look like, coiled in the corner of your screen? Like a disappointed lion. Like he’d fight you over the last refrigerated triangle of Primula cheese at a motorway hotel breakfast buffet. And this is his key quality, a muscular puritanism, an adherence to old Saxon poetry tropes of the warrior creed, of men who say things and then do things, where every game of football is in some sense the Battle of Maldon.</p> <p>This requires something to rail against. As a result it has led him into some weird places, not least his wrong-headed preoccupation with Paul Pogba, who is tall, but also skilful rather than physically dominant, and thus very difficult to process.</p> <p>And yet, for all that, I really don’t think Souness was trying to say women shouldn’t play football, or that women’s football is inferior. Even if this was, in its basic form, literally a man saying women’s football is inferior.</p> <p>I think what he was trying to express, poorly, was his enthusiasm for letting the game flow, a lust for extreme physicality, and his own obvious nostalgia for the world of his youth, a place where Wulfstan is always the noblest and bravest of all warriors, still out there defending the bridge from the Vikings.</p> <p>He used the wrong words and did so very carelessly. If he had said “this isn’t the under 11s” or “this isn’t badminton” it would have been OK, the same point made without pointlessly alienating many of his viewers. It might have been OK if he hadn’t then refused to back down and admit he had used the wrong words, but then his entire sense of self, the Sounessness of Souness, is built on not backing down. And yes this is an extended benefit of the doubt. But there is a strange kind of honesty in those simple warrior values. I just can’t believe Souness wouldn’t love watching women kick the crap out of each other just as much.</p> <p>So, that’s that then. Man rages, inaccurately, at the sky. It is the oldest of stories. But there is another element here too. The thing is, Souness did actually raise an interesting point, intentionally or not, something sport will surely unravel a little more coherently in the next few years.</p> <p>It is at this point that the flakes start to bleed pink, and something a little vague and unresolved starts to intrude. What Souness was saying, essentially, is that he enjoys watching extreme aggression. And that the most extreme physical aggression is, more often than not – and with all due exceptions – extreme male aggression, expressed, still, in extreme male terms.</p> <p>It is hard to talk about this without sounding like bad Hemingway after six quarts of sherry, musing on the muscular buttocks of the matador, the nobility of blood, bare forked man confronting his own rigid manly death staff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c7614520a7c20f302d934b4e686a85821a714ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c7614520a7c20f302d934b4e686a85821a714ba/0_107_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graeme Souness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘What does Souness look like, coiled in the corner of your screen? Like a disappointed lion.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malcolm Mackenzie/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But sport is still essentiality male-filtered. These disciplines were codified at a time when cliched ideas of male strength, male collisions, male manliness were an unquestioned ideal.</p> <p>The language of sport, its customs and behaviours, were minted that way over the next hundred years. A lot of this is simply styling and mannerism. But the thing that Souness could only express as male, that element of pure aggression remains a brilliant, vital ingredient, something to cherish and preserve.</p> <p>And who knows maybe Souness, in his unprogressive way, was actually saying something deeply progressive here. If there is one thing I would personally adjust in the way women’s sport is presented, it would be ditching the idea that it has to be an inspiration, to break down barriers, to make nice and bring together, rather than simply existing as theatre, the way the men’s game does.</p> <p>The future is surely in there, just a small step sideways from the Souness screed, a world where Sarina Wiegman is wheeling Martina Voss-Tecklenburg around by the post-match handshake, where Jill Scott is telling pricks to fuck off, not just once, but repeatedly. Where women are also giving it to women in the most womanly of women’s games; and where we all, Graeme included, get our game back.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/20/how-robert-garcia-can-help-anthony-joshua-against-oleksandr-usyk-boxing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T06:55:25Z","webTitle":"‘This guy teaches you’: how Robert Garcia can help Joshua against Usyk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/how-robert-garcia-can-help-anthony-joshua-against-oleksandr-usyk-boxing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/20/how-robert-garcia-can-help-anthony-joshua-against-oleksandr-usyk-boxing","fields":{"headline":"‘This guy teaches you’: how Robert Garcia can help Joshua against Usyk","trailText":"After Anthony Joshua cleared out his corner following defeat, he took on a trainer with 14 world champions to his name","byline":"Bryan Armen Graham","body":"<p>At this point Robert Garcia is no stranger to boxing’s biggest stages. As a fighter, the southern California native captured the IBF junior lightweight title and defended it twice before finding his true calling as a cornerman, where he’s trained no fewer than 14 world champions over more than two decades out of his flagship gym in the coastal town of Oxnard, some 60 miles north-west of Los Angeles.</p> <p>Should Anthony Joshua defy the oddsmakers against Oleksandr Usyk in Saturday night’s rematch in Saudi Arabia and regain the WBA, WBO and IBF heavyweight titles he surrendered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/25/oleksandr-usyk-shocks-anthony-joshua-to-claim-world-heavyweight-title\">in their one-sided first instalment last year</a>, there may be no bigger difference-maker than the 47-year-old Mexican-American trainer entrusted with drawing up the gameplan that was so conspicuously absent the first time around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/anthony-joshua-oleksandr-usyk-boxing-rematch-saudi-arabia\">Anthony Joshua desperate to avoid line in the sand with Usyk rematch | Sachin Nakrani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The fact that Robert is a former champion and was a fighter makes a huge difference in the way that he communicates to his athletes,” says Chris Algieri, the former WBO welterweight champion who trained under Garcia for several years in Oxnard. “Not all fighters were high level when they competed but Robert was, so his ability to be able to communicate and use the right words to get his fighters – whether they need to be fired up or they need to be more disciplined – he knows how to turn that extra knob to get the most out of them.”</p> <p>That rapport, both in the training that’s behind them and in the career-defining fight ahead, could prove crucial to Joshua’s hopes. His comprehensive defeat by Usyk last September at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was, above all, a tactical catastrophe. Rather than press his natural advantages in height, reach and power, Joshua curiously attempted to outbox the superior boxer in front of him. As the rounds ticked onward and Usyk mounted a commanding lead on the scorecards, Joshua was done no favours by a corner unable to implement anything even resembling an adjustment to alter the one-way traffic.</p> <p>From the moment Joshua exercised his immediate rematch clause in the aftermath, it was clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/29/anthony-joshua-let-down-by-his-corner-in-oleksandr-usyk-defeat\">a sweeping change was necessary</a>. That meant ending his decade-long partnership with Robert McCracken, the only trainer he’d ever known as a professional, who also guided Joshua to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/anthony-joshua-wins-gold-boxing\">a star-making Olympic gold medal</a> as the head coach of Team GB’s boxing team at the 2012 London Games.</p> <p>Joshua toured the United States at the end of last year in search of a replacement with Virgil Hunter, Eddy Reynoso and Ronnie Shields emerging as leading candidates. But he ultimately opted for Garcia, whose sterling reputation has only grown in the decade since he gained mainstream recognition upon being voted trainer of the year by America’s boxing writers in 2012.</p> <p>“He’s a teacher, he’s not a coach,” says Abner Mares, the three-division champion who teamed with Garcia after a series of confidence-shaking defeats to regain the featherweight title in 2016. “A coach can put on mitts, just sit and look pretty and tell you what you do, but this guy teaches you. He guides you. If a fighter walks into his gym, he doesn’t try to change how you stand or what you bring. He works with what you have, and that’s what separates Robert from other coaches.”</p> <p>While he’s nominally shared the role of chief trainer with longtime Joshua assistant Angel Fernandez in the backroom setup, Garcia is the addition that’s had everyone talking. On one hand it’s a partnership bursting with promise. Garcia has become associated with teaching a relentless pressure style peppered with roughhouse tactics, which if realised properly could make demands of Usyk that went unasked in their first meeting. Even fundamentals like leaning his 6ft 6in frame on Usyk in the clinch could at least make Saturday’s rematch at Jeddah’s King Abdullah Sports City more complicated for the clever southpaw than last year’s straightforward affair.</p> <p>On the other, none of the fighters on Garcia’s résumé of world champions have won a title above 160lb, making him something of an unproven entity in boxing’s prestige division. And will the scant three months that Garcia has spent with Joshua at his new Loughborough training headquarters offer enough time for his instruction to take meaningful hold?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0112d508b4bab12cb2950d6ab4c12fbce1fe043c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0112d508b4bab12cb2950d6ab4c12fbce1fe043c/0_13_2371_1422/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oleksandr Usyk is the superior boxer and outfoxed Anthony Joshua in their first fight last September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oleksandr Usyk is the superior boxer and outfoxed Anthony Joshua in their first fight last September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It takes time for a coach to change an athlete, especially one who’s been in the game as long as Joshua,” Algieri says. “He’s a world champion, a dominant world champion. I hate the saying ‘old dog, new tricks’, but teaching an established champion new stuff on short notice is almost impossible. I’m imagining that the conversations between Joshua and Robert were more important than the technique in terms of whatever kind of training they did.”</p> <p>But Mares believes Garcia’s track record of building fighters back up from hard defeats and helping them recapture world titles in upsets, as he famously did with Marcos Maidana and Brian Viloria, makes him a good fit for Joshua, who will go off as an underdog for the first time in his professional career on Saturday night.</p> <p>Mares would know. He was coming off a loss to Léo Santa Cruz and not too far removed from a devastating first-round destruction at the hands of Jhonny González when he joined Garcia’s stable. The partnership yielded immediate dividends when he surprised Jesús Cuellar to win the WBA featherweight championship in their first outing together.</p> <p>“It is a challenge when someone brings you a broken fighter, if you want to call it that,” Mares says. “Robert as a teacher, as a surgeon, as a doctor, whatever you want to call him: he fixes things and he makes them better. With Anthony Joshua, I think more than anything it’s his confidence. This is just me seeing it from the outside, but Robert can get the focus back to the fundamentals.</p> <p>“Physically, Anthony Joshua is always 100%. He looks like a monster. But it’s the mental part now that I hope they’ve worked on. If he’s good there, I think everything else is going to come out great.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/20/planta-sapiens-by-paco-calvo-review-extraterrestrials-in-the-garden","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T06:30:32Z","webTitle":"Planta Sapiens by Paco Calvo review – extraterrestrials in the garden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/20/planta-sapiens-by-paco-calvo-review-extraterrestrials-in-the-garden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/20/planta-sapiens-by-paco-calvo-review-extraterrestrials-in-the-garden","fields":{"headline":"Planta Sapiens by Paco Calvo review – extraterrestrials in the garden","trailText":"A mind-expanding exploration of botanical intelligence argues that plants can remember, learn and even plan ahead","byline":"PD Smith","body":"<p>In Denis Villeneuve’s 2016 movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/01/arrival-review-amy-adams-denis-villeneuve-alien-contact\" title=\"\">Arrival </a>the US army asks an expert in linguistics to decipher the complex language of the seven-limbed aliens (“heptapods”) who have landed on Earth. It’s a memorable and indeed moving attempt to portray the immense challenges involved in bridging the gulf of mutual incomprehension between two completely different species.</p> <p>I thought of Arrival while reading Paco Calvo’s remarkable book, the result of “two decades of passionate exploration into a rich and alternate world that exists alongside our own” – the world of plants. The subject of his exploration is startlingly radical: the question of whether plants can be regarded as possessing intelligence.</p> <p>Calvo is a professor of the philosophy of science in the Minimal Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Murcia, Spain. Although he presents detailed scientific evidence to support his case, he also draws on philosophical arguments about the nature of consciousness. We humans have a tendency to believe that the world revolves around us, but Calvo writes that intelligence is “not quite as special as we like to think”. He argues that it’s time to accept that other organisms, even drastically different ones, may be capable of it.</p> <p>“I am getting very much amused by my tendrils,” Darwin <a href=\"https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-4241.xml\" title=\"\">wrote</a> to a friend in 1863. Confined to his sickbed for weeks, the author of On the Origin of Species occupied himself by studying the movements of cucumber plants on his windowsill. As he convalesced, he was forced to live slowly – “to become more plant-like”, Calvo writes – and this stillness opened his mind to the wonder of his vegetable companions: “It allowed him to see them more on their terms, to experience plant life at plant pace.”</p> <p>Darwin has clearly been a guiding presence in Calvo’s attempt to open up a new frontier in science: “He learned to think differently and clearly outside the frameworks in which most of his contemporaries happily confined themselves.” The result of his confinement with the cucumbers was a 118-page monograph on The Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants. Darwin realised before anyone else that these movements were in fact “behaviour”, comparable to that of animals. And observing behaviour is the route to understanding intelligence. In plants, it reveals a range of faculties “from learning and memory to competitive, risk-sensitive behaviours, and even numerical abilities”.</p> <p>In the course of his book, Calvo describes many experiments that reveal plants’ remarkable range, including the way they communicate with others nearby using “chemical talk”, a language encoded in about 1,700 volatile organic compounds. He also shows how, like animals, they can be anaesthetised. In lectures, he places a Venus flytrap under a glass bell jar with a cotton pad soaked in anaesthetic. After an hour the plant no longer responds to touch by closing its traps. Tests show the plant’s electrical activity has stopped. It is effectively asleep, just as a cat would be. He also notes that the process of germination in seeds can be halted under anaesthetic. If plants can be put to sleep, does that imply they also have a waking state? Calvo thinks it does, for he argues that plants are not just “photosynthetic machines” and that it’s quite possible that they have an individual experience of the world: “They may be <em>aware</em>.”</p> <p>Other studies show that some plants retain a memory of where the sun will rise, in order to turn their leaves towards the first rays. They store this knowledge – an internal model of what the sun is going to do – for several days, even when kept in total darkness. The conclusion must be that they constantly collect information, processing and retaining it in order to “make predictions, learn, and even plan ahead”.</p> <p>Of course, these are revolutionary ideas and, as Calvo admits, contested by many scientists who study the physiology of plants. But he guides us patiently through the latest research and builds a compelling case that, unlikely as it may seem, deserves to be taken seriously.</p> <p>Clearly plants don’t have brains in any familiar sense of the word. But although they lack our grey matter, Calvo believes they have a unique “green matter”. In the absence of nerves, plants use networked cells to regulate themselves. Their vascular system consists of tubes arranged in layers, like the mammalian cortex, that run from root to shoot. It transmits electrical signals, like a “green cable that carries news throughout the plant”. This, he suggests, is where we need to look for a “phytonervous” system. Calvo admits, however, that it is too early to say whether, even in the most complex plants, it amounts to “the functional equivalent of a hierarchically organised but diffused brain”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"926d828cb03baa826b2ef2bc06e472ca826da92d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/926d828cb03baa826b2ef2bc06e472ca826da92d/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Venus flytraps can be anaesthetised, just like animals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Venus flytraps can be anaesthetised, just like animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Shirk/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fundamentally, Calvo’s important book is about changing our perception of plants. He points out that without them “human life would be untenable”. As we confront the reality of the climate crisis, we need to accept plants as “co-inhabitants of the planet”. Grasping this reality could lead to a fundamental shift in our view of our own role in the biosphere, and help us to work to rebalance our destructive effects on it. As in the movie Arrival, embracing the otherness of a fundamentally different form of life could transform both our understanding of ourselves and our role on the planet.</p> <p>Calvo has a wonderfully infectious enthusiasm for his subject that makes this book, for all its complex science, a joy to read. He challenges us to set aside our “zoocentric” perspective and to change our view of plants radically: from mechanisms akin to robots to complex organisms with a range of behaviours, responding to and anticipating their environments. In doing so, he has written a genuinely mind‑expanding book.</p> <p>• Planta Sapiens: Unmasking Plant Intelligence by Paco Calvo with Natalie Lawrence is published by Little, Brown (£14.99) on 25 August.

The buzziest series on the CW are centered on teenagers: Riverdale, a modern, supernatural update on the Archie comics, and All American, about a Black high school football player recruited to play for a school in Beverly Hills. They also have two superhero shows, Superman &amp; Lois and The Flash, which also theoretically appeal to younger audiences. Youthful content, however, does not necessarily equal youthful viewers, which we learned this week when it was revealed that <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/the-cw-age-average-viewer-broadcast-1235342962/\">the average age of a CW viewer is 58</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/wednesday-netflix-tv-series-movie\">No, your TV series isn’t an eight-hour movie, it’s a TV series | Charles Bramesco</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a twist worthy of Riverdale itself, which recently featured a time travel storyline, the hip, young viewers of the CW have suddenly turned middle-aged. Or maybe not. The data cited by Nexstar, a media group that has just bought a controlling interest in the network, tracks only initial viewership and some DVR viewing. It says nothing of viewing on streaming services, where younger viewers increasingly get their television. For that, the youth has options. The CW has its own streaming site where shows can be viewed for free, but they also have a licensing deal with Netflix. In other words, while it’s possible Riverdale and All American are being watched by gray-haired viewers, most of its fans are still watching it on Netflix while keeping one eye on TikTok.</p> <p>The news was <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/08/cw-average-viewer-age-58-nexstar-1235092697/\">good fodder for jokes on social media</a>, but its implications are stark. It’s no industry secret that streaming is on its way to becoming the dominant format for television – and maybe even movies – but this announcement essentially gives us the expiration date for broadcast and cable. If a network as youth-oriented as the CW has an average viewing age approaching 60 – and only one other network, FOX, has a younger audience at 56 – the end of “traditional television” is on the horizon. To put it bluntly, the folks who watch broadcast and cable will not be around forever, and when they’re gone, there will be few viewers left who don’t see streaming as the norm.</p> <p>And if that wasn’t enough to scare network executives, consider this: last month, for the first time ever, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/streaming-tops-cable-tv-viewing-nielsen-1235344466/\">streaming platforms surpassed cable in popularity</a>. The streamers had beaten out broadcast networks before, but cable had continued to hold on to its spot at the top until July, when streaming represented 34.8% of total consumption in the US, with cable coming in at 34.4% and broadcast limping to a third-place finish with 21.6%. To be sure, the conditions were just right for this. Streaming had a particularly strong month, with the fourth season of Stranger Things and The Gray Man, starring Hollywood stars Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, premiering on Netflix. Meanwhile, Amazon Prime’s The Terminal List <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/08/10/the-terminal-list-creator-addresses-woke-criticism/\">racked up over 1.5bn minutes of viewing despite dismal reviews</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e9f5730b03eedd3e95db8d184cd309a66b78a5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e9f5730b03eedd3e95db8d184cd309a66b78a5b/273_0_3164_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sadie Sink in Stranger Things\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sadie Sink in Stranger Things</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also didn’t help that it was the only month of the year without either NBA or NFL action. Of the four major US sports, only baseball has games in July. Live events, especially sports, are increasingly the only thing cable and broadcast television have going for it, but the streaming services are making their play here. AppleTV+ has begun streaming baseball on Friday nights, and starting next year, it will be the sole television provider of Major League Soccer.</p> <p>More importantly, Amazon Prime will hold exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football starting this fall. The NFL might be the only thing keeping the networks afloat; for the 2021-2022 television season, football dominated the ratings, with various weekly football telecasts making up each of the top four spots. The NFL has been part of the network television landscape from nearly the beginning; games started being broadcast regularly soon after the second world war, and the first championship game to be nationally televised came in 1948. If streaming services ever deepen their inroads with the NFL, broadcast TV will be as good as dead, and cable will be on life support.</p> <p>Then again, every end brings new opportunities. Maybe traditional television could find a way to reinvent itself, albeit with lower expectations for ratings. The CW have announced a goal of shifting their demographic focus, creating more content that will appeal to their older viewers. There will be fewer original, scripted programs, and more “high-quality syndicated programming” and unscripted shows. This probably means reality television and competitions shows like The Masked Singer and America’s Got Talent. Sports were not mentioned. The goal isn’t to increase the ratings to where they once were. It’s a strategy of efficiency, saving money while catering to the core audience, but it’s hardly certain to stave off the inevitability of the streaming revolution. Like their viewers, broadcast and cable television aren’t guaranteed to go on forever, and for the first time, it feels like the end is in sight.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/20/us-political-violence-civil-war","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T06:05:31Z","webTitle":"US political violence is surging, but talk of a civil war is exaggerated – isn’t it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/20/us-political-violence-civil-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/20/us-political-violence-civil-war","fields":{"headline":"US political violence is surging, but talk of a civil war is exaggerated – isn’t it?","trailText":"The FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago unleashed the latest barrage of threats of violence, on top of a wave of threats against election workers and rising weapons sales","byline":"Chris McGreal","body":"<p>Dr Garen Wintemute used to laugh off warnings of a civil war coming to America as “crazy talk”. Then the emergency room doctor in California saw the figures for gun sales.</p> <p>Wintemute, who founded a centre to research firearms violence after years of treating gunshot wounds, had long observed that the rush to buy weapons came in waves, often around a presidential election. Always it fell back again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/joe-biden-donald-trump-us-politics\">How a wild week in Washington changed the game for Biden and Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Then in January of 2020 gun sales took off. Just an unprecedented surge in purchasing and that surge continued,” he said. “We were aware that, contrary to prior surges, this one wasn’t ending. People are still buying guns like crazy.”<br>Many were buying a weapon for the first time.</p> <p>Wintemute wanted answers and they stunned him. A <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.22277693v1.full\">survey for his</a> California Firearm Violence Research Center released last month showed that half of Americans expect a civil war in the United States in the next few years. One in five thought political violence was justified in some circumstances. In addition, while almost everyone said it was important for the US to remain a democracy, about 40% said that having a strong leader was more important.</p> <p>“Coupled with prior research, these findings suggest a continuing alienation from and mistrust of American democratic society and its institutions. Substantial minorities of the population endorse violence, including lethal violence, to obtain political objectives,” the report concluded.</p> <p>Suddenly Wintemute didn’t think talk of a violent civil conflict was so crazy any more.</p> <p>The doctor is quick to note that large numbers of those people expecting a civil war say it is only “somewhat likely”. But half of the population even considering such a possibility reflects the failing confidence of large numbers of Americans in a system of government under assault by Donald Trump and a good part of the Republican party.</p> <p>The FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence earlier this month for classified documents removed from the White House unleashed the latest barrage of threats of violence, this time directed at an institution widely regarded as a bastion of establishment conservatism.</p> <p>The Florida senator Rick Scott likened the FBI to the Gestapo. In Ohio, the police killed an armed US navy veteran who attacked an FBI office. In Pennsylvania, a man with a history of vaccine denial was charged with threatening to “slaughter” federal agents he described as “police state scum”, and compared to the Nazi SS and the Soviet secret police.</p> <p>In the days after the search of Mar-a-Lago, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned of a surge in threats of violence against federal agents, their families and the judge who issued the search warrant. The FBI said these included calls for “civil war” and “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mar-a-lago-search-fbi-threat-law-enforcement/\">armed rebellion</a>”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3dd5008ac5ea3b8deaa4db656a92337fa88fe72b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dd5008ac5ea3b8deaa4db656a92337fa88fe72b/0_381_5712_3427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The FBI headquarters, seen behind security fencing, in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The FBI headquarters, seen behind security fencing, in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That comes on top of a wave of threats against election workers since Trump alleged he was robbed of victory by fraud in 2020, and a sharp increase in intimidation of others in public service from school board members to librarians as well as elected politicians.</p> <p>Wintemute said that the surge in violent threats is made more potent by rising weapons sales. “What happens when you take a society that is increasingly fearful for its future, increasingly polarised, increasingly angry at itself, and throw a bunch of guns into the mix?” he said.</p> <h2>‘Willing to harm other Americans for their political beliefs’</h2> <p>Many Americans flinch at talk of civil war because it recalls the bloodiest conflict in their history. The threat of violent conflict in the US also looks very different from the wars once fought by guerrillas in Latin America and Africa, or during the breakup of Yugoslavia.</p> <p>But Rachel Kleinfeld, a specialist in civil conflict at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that does not mean it cannot happen. “Countries with democracies and governments as strong as America’s do not fall into civil war. But if our institutions weaken, the story could be different,” she said.</p> <p>“What most worries me right now is polling that suggests somewhere between 20% and 40% of Americans would like a strongman leader who doesn’t have to follow the democratic rules. That would allow institutions to weaken and an insurgency like the Troubles in Northern Ireland could break out.”</p> <p>The parallel with Northern Ireland may jar but recent polling suggests it is not unwarranted. In 1973, in the midst of some of the worst years of the Troubles, one in five people in Northern Ireland agreed that “violence is a legitimate way to achieve one’s goals”. Half a century later, a similar proportion of <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.15.22277693v1.full\">Republican voters</a> in the US say that it is “justified to use political violence to accomplish political goals”.</p> <p>A more complex picture emerges when the numbers are broken down, including over whether such violence is targeted against people or property. But even then Kleinfeld said the results are disturbing. “You’re looking at 3 to 5 million Americans willing to harm other Americans for their political beliefs,” she said.</p> <h2>‘Politicians’ attacks on the system’</h2> <p>The US has a long history of political violence and killings, including bombing campaigns by radical leftwing organisations in the 1970s and more recent attacks from the right by anti-abortion groups and white nationalists. The country’s deadliest domestic terrorist attack, the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, was perpetrated by members of an anti-government militia.</p> <p>But now the greatest threat to political stability comes from within the power structure including Republican politicians subverting the electoral system and further eroding trust in democracy.</p> <p>Trump’s allegation that the 2020 presidential election was stolen unleashed actual and threatened violence from the storming of the Capitol to the barrage of threats to kill election workers. The justice department set up a special taskforce to protect election officials after more than 1,000 were directly threatened over their unwillingness to declare Trump the winner in 2020. Many <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-march-2022\">have quit or intend to do so before the 2024</a> presidential election because of “politicians’ attacks on the system and stress”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db8e03165a72a7426d92423a8cb14c002cb23f07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db8e03165a72a7426d92423a8cb14c002cb23f07/0_297_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters rally near Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters rally near Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karla Coté/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wintemute said that with the attack on election workers has come a parallel effort by Republican leaders to weight the electoral system in their favour through gerrymandering and obstacles to voting in swing states that further undermines confidence in democracy.</p> <p>“One of the great ironies is that there is the false narrative that the election was rigged which is being used in order to set up a rigged election in the future,” he said.</p> <p>“Democrats see democracy is under threat because of authoritarianism from the right and the prospect of stolen midterms and the infrastructure that’s been setting up for a stolen presidential election in 2024. For the right, it already happened. Many people in our survey say 2020 was stolen. So their point of view is that the threat has been realised. It’s hard to see a good way out.”</p> <p>To Kleinfeld that in part explains the significant numbers of Democrats also prepared to justify political violence in certain circumstances – 13% compared with 20% of Republicans. She said that, nonetheless, actual acts of violence are almost entirely from one side.</p> <p>“What that suggests is that the American people are very frustrated with our democracy, and don’t think it’s working. But Republicans think they can get away with violence, and it’s being normalised by their leaders, whereas Democratic leaders are keeping a check on their side. But that’s not to say that will be forever,” she said.<br>Underpinning all of this are America’s changing demographics and the diminishing of white political power.</p> <p>Wintemute’s survey showed that one in three people buys into the far right “great replacement” conspiracy theory that white Americans are being supplanted by minorities – cited by the murderers of dozens of people in recent massacres from Texas to New York state. The “great replacement” theory is also regularly aired on Fox News.</p> <p>Lilliana Mason, the author of Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity, said the election of the US’s first black president, Barack Obama, in 2008 made race “a really salient issue” for many white voters.</p> <p>“Then Trump said the quiet part out loud. He started using overtly racist and misogynistic language and creating a permission structure for his supporters to become much more aggressive and intentionally offensive in their rhetoric. That really encouraged not just uncivil behaviour but broke all of these social norms that we had previously considered to be sacred,” she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db34a8cef54688ee6111423ae3534de6468e752e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db34a8cef54688ee6111423ae3534de6468e752e/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump departs Trump Tower in New York City two days after FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump departs Trump Tower in New York City two days after FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump’s embrace of white nationalist groups, such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, also brought armed militias into mainstream politics, helping them to infiltrate local police forces and the military.</p> <p>In December, three retired US generals said that Trumpism has infected parts of the armed forces and noted the “disturbing number of veterans and active-duty members of the military” who took part in the attack on the Capitol. They warned of the “potential for lethal chaos inside our military” if the result of 2024 presidential election is disputed.</p> <p>“The potential for a total breakdown of the chain of command along partisan lines – from the top of the chain to squad level – is significant should another insurrection occur. The idea of rogue units organizing among themselves to support the ‘rightful’ commander in chief <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/17/eaton-taguba-anderson-generals-military/\">cannot be dismissed</a>,” they wrote</p> <p>“It really does feel a pivotal moment in in American democracy,” says Mason. “We’re probably going to see more violence.

But does that make her a general without an army?","byline":"David Smith in Washington","body":"<p>She knew the price of defying Donald Trump but did it anyway. Liz Cheney, crushed in a primary election in Wyoming, was anointed by supporters and commentators as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/15/liz-cheneys-political-life-is-likely-ending-just-beginning/\">leader of the Republican resistance</a> to the former US president.</p> <p>But that invited a question: what resistance? Admirers of the three-term congresswoman who lost her House seat to a Trump-backed challenger warn that she could now find herself a general without an army.</p> <p>In her concession speech in Jackson, Wyoming, on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/wyoming-republican-primary-liz-cheney-donald-trump-harriet-hageman\">Cheney pointed out that</a> if she had been willing to parrot Trump’s election lies, she would have remained in Congress. Instead she voted to impeach him and, as vice-chair of the January 6 committee, eviscerated him on primetime TV.</p> <p>Now, having transferred leftover campaign funds into a new entity, The Great Task, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/liz-cheney-president-2024-trump-republican-primary-defeat\">hinted at a presidential run</a>, she seems determined to embrace her status as the face of the Never Trump movement.</p> <p>“She set herself up to be that, to be the force that is going to stand up and fight because very few people have come forward and taken such a powerful stance,” said <a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott</a>, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York.</p> <p>“It helps that she lost so she’s able to do that. That’s what she’s hoping to be.”</p> <p>The Great Task, however, may be an understatement of the challenge ahead. Trump’s Republican critics did appear to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/03/donald-trump-ron-desantis-republicans-maga-presidential-candidate\">the wind at their backs</a> just couple of months ago as his poll ratings sank, he was pummeled by the January 6 committee and candidates he endorsed lost primaries in Georgia and elsewhere.</p> <p>But the 76-year-old managed to turn an FBI search for government secrets at his home in Florida into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/joe-biden-donald-trump-us-politics\">a public relations triumph</a> with his base. Donations poured in and Republicans rallied. Even potential 2024 rivals such as Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, felt obliged to question the justice department’s motives.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump-favoured candidates surged in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-donald-trump-presidential-phoenix-arizona-aa7c453639b27d0e856460b91fcd70d2\">states such as Arizona</a>, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Of the 10 House Republicans, including Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6 insurrection, only two remain up for re-election.</p> <p>McDermott said: “It seemed like he was fading from the public eye and a lot of people, especially Republicans, were glad about that. But his base is being riled up again. The FBI search was one source of that. The primary wins have been another.</p> <p>“He has bounced back. He’s rebounded quite a bit from where he was post-presidency. At this point he is the titular head of the Republican party, whether people want him to be or not.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.filuntz.com/\">Frank Luntz</a>, a pollster who has advised many Republican campaigns, agreed that the primary wins are significant. He said: “Trump’s probably stronger with the GOP right now because of the Mar-a-Lago raid than in any time in the last six months.</p> <p>“He’s turned himself into a victim and that unites Republicans around him. So they [the US justice department] better have something, because he has a new life within the GOP.”</p> <h2>‘Whatever it takes’</h2> <p>Anti-Trump forces remain scattered. Some Republican senators, such as Mitt Romney of Utah, and governors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/fbi-trump-search-gop-outrageous-rhetoric\">such as Larry Hogan of Maryland</a>, remain willing to speak out. Disaffected conservatives have set up ventures such as the Lincoln Project, Principles First, the Republican Accountability Project and the Bulwark website.</p> <p>Adam Kinzinger, Cheney’s sole Republican colleague on the January 6 committee, created a group called <a href=\"https://www.country1st.com/\">Country First</a> to recruit and back anti-Trump candidates. But Kinzinger himself is retiring.</p> <p>With her storied name – her father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/05/dick-cheney-trump-liz-cheney-threat-republic\">Dick Cheney</a>, was vice-president under George W Bush – Cheney could emerge as the de facto resistance leader, touring the country and TV studios, prosecuting the case against Trump as an existential threat to democracy. Her work on the January 6 committee will continue until she relinquishes her seat in January. More televised hearings are promised.</p> <p>On Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/liz-cheney-commits-broad-united-front-seeking-defeat-trump-rcna43465\">she told NBC</a>: “I will be doing whatever it takes to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office.”</p> <p>She added that running for president “is something I’m thinking about and I’ll make a decision in the coming months”.</p> <p>It would be tough. Cheney would have almost no chance of winning a primary and could expect the Republican National Committee to look for reasons to keep her off the debate stage. Few know the pitfalls better than Joe Walsh, a former congressman from Illinois <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/02/republican-joe-walsh-iowa-trump\">who took on Trump</a> in 2020.</p> <p>Walsh said: “There is no anti-Trump movement in the Republican party. I love Liz and she’s a hero for what she did and God bless her but, as I realised two years ago, there’s no room in that party for me. There’s no room in this party for her. She knows that. She’s got a bigger name so she’ll leverage it but she’s got no army to lead.”</p> <p>So where do anti-Trump Republicans go from here?</p> <p>“What Liz Cheney is going to find is this is a difficult road because, if you play this road out all the way, you have to do what I do, which is temporarily be on Team Democrat, which is weird for a Tea Party guy like me.</p> <p>“I know Liz believes the Republican party right now is a threat to our democracy. If you believe that then you have to support people who will defeat Republicans and right now the only people who will defeat Republicans are Democrats. I think Liz is getting close to that point.”</p> <p>Walsh admitted that being on “Team Democrat” is still a strange sensation.</p> <p>“It’s fucking bizarre. Once a week, I pinch myself and think, ‘How the hell did I get here?’ I mean, I’m out there trying to help <a href=\"https://timforoh.com/\">Tim Ryan win in Ohio</a> but this is where we are because my former party has become what they’ve become.</p> <p>“I don’t know what Liz will do. Again, she’s a different animal because she’s a Cheney and she can stay in that party and raise hell, but to what end? It can’t be changed.”</p> <h2>‘A big mistake’</h2> <p>If Trump is the Republican nominee, Cheney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/liz-cheney-biden-trump-2024-election\">could stand as an independent</a> in a general election. But that would run the “spoiler” risk of peeling off anti-Trump Republicans from the Democrat, presumably Joe Biden, and inadvertently giving Trump a path to the White House.</p> <p>Luntz predicted: “She actually would take away more Biden votes than Trump votes.”</p> <p>Cheney has won the admiration of Democrats and independents but some observers detect hubris. In her concession speech, she raised eyebrows by drawing parallels with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/abraham-lincoln\">Abraham Lincoln</a>, the president who steered the union through the civil war.</p> <p><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/teamcheney/cheney-now-the-real-work-begins?e=a8ebb5daf2\">Cheney said</a>: “The great and original champion of our party, Abraham Lincoln, was defeated in elections for the Senate and the House before he won the most important election of all. Lincoln ultimately prevailed, he saved our union, and he defined our obligation as Americans for all of history.”</p> <p>Luntz said: “Some Republicans who admire her tenacity and her convictions became annoyed that she compared herself to Abraham Lincoln. That was a big mistake. Whoever wrote that line really should be fired because instead of it being about Trump it became about her. And that did her irreparable damage.”</p> <p>The Cheneys have been players in Washington for half a century, from the time Dick Cheney first ran for Congress to the arrival of Liz Cheney in 2017. She rose to the same position as her father, No 3 Republican in the House, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/12/liz-cheney-ousting-republican-party-trump-big-lie\">only to be ousted</a> as punishment for her dissent.</p> <p>Then, on Tuesday, after the highest turnout of any Republican primary in Wyoming’s 132-year history, Cheney lost to the conservative lawyer Harriet Hageman by 36 points. Trump acolytes gloated that it signified the final purge of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cheney-defeat-marks-end-of-era-for-gop-65c8b400b533dffc422322031a0dbf5c\">the Bush-Cheney era</a>, surpassed by his populist brand of “America first” and baseless conspiracy theories. The Never Trumpers were in retreat once more.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/larry-jacobs\">Larry Jacobs</a>, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “Liz Cheney certainly won the hearts of many Democrats and independents but her power in the Republican party doesn’t hold a candle to Donald Trump.</p> <p>“We have to just be honest about that. She’s not a real threat to Donald Trump. She sees herself as kind of saviour but it’s in a party that’s not really looking for a saviour.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/20/why-are-four-leaf-clovers-lucky-and-what-dogs-can-run-the-fastest-try-our-kids-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Why are four-leaf clovers lucky, and what dogs can run the fastest?

Although they look similar, jaguars are more muscular, with a wider head and big, strong jaws. Leopards are nimbler at climbing trees and have longer tails, which help them balance., 3:C - Toenails keep the blood vessels, muscles and flesh underneath them safe – like armour for your toes!, 4:B - Greyhounds are the fastest dog breed – they can run up to 72km an hour. That’s almost double the speed the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt, has run., 5:B - Sadly not. It would burst around 10km above the Earth.

More than half of pregnant or breastfeeding woman are also malnourished.</p> <p>Health officials consider malnutrition rates of 15% or over indicative of an emergency situation where the humanitarian needs are critical. In one area of Tigray, 65% of children under five were malnourished. In another, the proportion was 55%, with 16% suffering from the more serious severe acute malnutrition.</p> <p>A malnourished child is estimated to be 12 times more likely to die than their well-nourished counterparts. The high level of malnutrition in Tigray “calls for urgent action to strengthen wasting treatment interventions [in the region] to prevent excess mortality due to malnutrition”, said the assessment, published on Friday.</p> <p>Claire Nevill, a spokesperson for WFP in Ethiopia, said the figures were extremely worrying and likely to worsen as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/17/hungry-starving-aid-agency-face-dilemma-ukraine-yemen-ethiopia-sudan\">UN faces a funding squeeze</a>, partly as a result of the war in Ukraine. WFP’s funding to treat malnutrition across northern Ethiopia was “fast running out”, Nevill added.</p> <p>The emergency food security assessment, the first conducted by WFP in Tigray this year, paints a worrying picture of a society struggling to recover from 21 months of war.</p> <p>While there is currently an uneasy truce between Tigrayan forces and troops loyal to the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, and some aid is getting in, the region is still facing restrictions on basic services such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/29/anguish-of-tigrayan-families-cut-off-by-telecom-shutdown-ethiopia\">communications and banking</a>, the latter meaning that people do not have easy access to cash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff829b8690985566a9e3f4f0b0f3709a868b7ecf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff829b8690985566a9e3f4f0b0f3709a868b7ecf/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some aid is entering the region, but supply chains with the rest of Ethiopia are severely disrupted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some aid is entering the region, but supply chains with the rest of Ethiopia are severely disrupted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Nevill/WFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Supply chains with the rest of Ethiopia remain disrupted and the assessment found the price of staples such as sorghum and teff has “skyrocketed” since the start of the conflict in November 2020. Fuel is in very short supply.</p> <p>As a result of these and other pressures, WFP said, 5.2 million people – nearly 90% of the population – are now deemed “food insecure”, an increase of six percentage points on the last assessment. Out of this, 2.4 million people (47%) are considered “severely food insecure”, which WFP defines as having “extreme food consumption gaps”.</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/06/famine-what-is-it-where-will-it-strike-and-how-should-the-world-respond\">a famine to be declared</a> in a certain part of the world, at least 20% of households must be facing an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 a day dying “due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease”.</p> <p>Nevill said that although the malnutrition and food insecurity statistics for Tigray were deeply concerning there was no reliable data on mortality that would point to a famine declaration.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/19/hunger-in-tigray-pushing-women-and-girls-into-sex-work\">Hunger in Tigray pushing women and girls into sex work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We just don’t know,” she said. “But we do know that the next three months [before the autumn harvest] are critical, and if we don’t scale up our response and get this food into the hands of communities now as the lean season approaches, people will certainly move closer to the edge.”</p> <p>Nevill said it was essential that the parties to the conflict maintained the access route into Tigray from the neighbouring Afar region, through which all humanitarian convoys have been passing since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/01/first-food-aid-for-100-days-enters-tigray-under-humanitarian-truce\">their resumption in April</a>.

But scientists say there is a misconception that this latest vaccine is an upgrade on what has come before.</p> <p>The evolution of the Covid virus to be more transmissible and better evade immunity is outpacing even innovative mRNA vaccines such as Moderna’s. The current generation of vaccines remain essential to protect us against severe illness and death. But when it comes to controlling infection, we are in a situation equivalent to running at a steady speed on a treadmill that is accelerating.</p> <p>Now leading scientists are calling for a renewed focus on nasal vaccines, delivered through a spray up the nose rather than an injection. They say nasal vaccines have the best chance of being able to halt Covid transmission and bring infections down to a manageable level.</p> <p>“Solving this problem of inducing really effective immunity to block transmission is such an important challenge, it really deserves to receive significant attention and energy even though it’s going to take some time and effort,” said Dr Sandy Douglas, a member of the team that delivered the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.</p> <p>Current vaccines trigger a response in the systemic immune system, which helps to prevents serious illness once an infection has occurred. But a major shortcoming has been the failure of injected vaccines to produce immunity in the respiratory tract – so-called mucosal immunity – which is the body’s first line of defence against Covid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/ways-totakethecovidvaccine/giv-6562vf583pQrR4Eg\" data-alt=\"Covid nasal vaccines\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/ways-totakethecovidvaccine/giv-6562vf583pQrR4Eg\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“It’s like having guards behind the castle’s gate versus having guards in front,” said Benjamin Goldman-Israelow, an infectious diseases researcher at Yale.</p> <p>Many now view a nasal vaccine as the most realistic way of achieving nasal immunity and breaking the chain of Covid transmission. More than a dozen clinical trials of nasal vaccines are under way, including a phase 1 trial of a nasal version of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.</p> <p>The challenge should not be underestimated, according to Douglas. “To protect against transmission, we’re in the territory of trying to do significantly better than exposure to the virus does naturally,” he said.</p> <p>There is less experience with nasal vaccines. The most widely used to date is Flumist, AstraZeneca’s influenza spray, which uses a weakened influenza virus that works by entering the cells of the nasal lining and triggering an immune reaction.</p> <p>This kind of vaccine needs to hit a sweet spot where enough virus is delivered to kickstart the immune system, but not so much that the virus starts replicating and results in the person becoming infectious (the phenomenon behind a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/22/polio-uk-public-health-officials-declare-national-incident-over-poliovirus\">recent spate of polio cases in the UK</a>). “That’s not a road people are very enthusiastic about going down with a new vaccine,” said Douglas.</p> <p>With new vaccine approaches, there is always the possibility of unexpected side-effects, which could deter some companies. An intranasal flu vaccine used in Switzerland in the 1990s was withdrawn <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15317028/\">after being linked to cases of facial paralysis</a>. “The safety profile may well turn out to be better for nasal vaccines, but there’s a little bit more of the unknown,” Douglas said.</p> <p>There is also no consensus on how effective a nasal vaccine would need to be in order to make it to market. “It is safe to say that a complete or near complete block of transmission would be preferable,” said Dr Samuel Wu, the interim chief medical officer of the US-based company CyanVac, which is preparing to take a Covid nasal vaccine into a phase 2 trial.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/17/unexpected-changing-waves-covid-seasonal\">‘The way it’s playing out is unexpected’: UK faces up to changing waves of Covid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, a small percentage reduction in transmission can make a big real-world difference. “A 30% reduction in transmission would result in a 65% reduction in infections after three rounds of transmission,” said Wu.</p> <p>“The harder question to answer is how you would actually measure reduction in transmission in a clinical trial,” he added. “We have performed a cohabitation model to show that our vaccine reduces Covid transmission in ferrets, but as far as we know no one has tried to conduct such an experiment with human volunteers.”</p> <p>Prof Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale, co-founded the company <a href=\"https://ocr.yale.edu/news/xanadu-bio-obtains-licenses-and-options-novel-platform-technologies-yale-university\">Xanadu Bio</a> to develop a nasal booster vaccine designed to “coax” existing circulating immunity (from an injected vaccine) into the respiratory tract, without requiring live virus.</p> <p>The vaccine, which delivers the Covid spike protein to the nose, offered protection against transmission in animal tests, and the team hopes to launch a phase 1 trial next year. But Iwasaki says a coordinated effort will be required to deliver a nasal vaccine to market, and she has called for “Operation Nasal Vaccine at lightning speed”, an initiative similar to Operation Warp Speed for this stage of the pandemic. </p> <p>“A small academic lab like mine is not equipped with manufacturing, regulatory, distribution capabilities,” she said. “This requires sufficient support by public and private sectors.”</p> <p>Douglas agrees. “There are market failures in vaccine development because companies are reluctant to take the risks. They don’t reap the full benefits to society,” he said. “If they’re going to have to bear the costs and risks without substantial public funding, not enough research happens.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/20/which-muppets-were-named-after-new-york-hotels-the-saturday-quiz","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Which muppets were named after New York hotels?

Over on a hilltop stand the silver canopy of an olive grove and the remains of a stone windmill, spokes and sails long absent.

He greets us warmly, asks if we’re having a good walk, then carries on with his work.</p> <p>From there, we amble through another flower-filled meadow, then switchback down to the picturesque village of Faros, a cluster of white cubic houses hugging a bay. Once the island’s main port, Faros is quiet today, so we continue walking to the beaches of Vlicho and Apokofto and, our destination, the 16th-century monastery of Chryssopigi.

A fortified medieval settlement built as a labyrinth around a 6th-century BC acropolis, Kastro has been continuously inhabited since the third millennium BC and was the island’s capital until 1836, but – as in Faros – inhabitants seem few during these quiet days before the Orthodox Easter. Each morning as we set out, we’re greeted by a chorus of songbirds, roosters and mourning doves, the distant tinkling of goats’ bells, and the mewing of cats who have learned that we will gladly dispense affection along with small bites of food. The people we see on Kastro’s narrow cobbled streets, accessible only by foot, can be counted on two hands: an older woman clad in black who never fails to bid us good morning, the village priest who teaches violin and lute down the alley from our accommodation, a street sweeper, and a handful of tourists who, like us, are here to walk.</p> <p>Kastro is like a living museum, with sarcophagi and other antiquities scattered in the streets, yet its cafes and tavernas are shuttered at this time of year. There aren’t enough locals to warrant keeping them open year-round, and there aren’t enough tourists either. Most of Kastro’s businesses will open for Easter weekend and then close again until peak season in July and August.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bad9f8e6b6afc543af5d2cf7603e2078a71ad59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bad9f8e6b6afc543af5d2cf7603e2078a71ad59/0_0_5585_3353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kamares is the main port of Sifnos and also has one of the island’s best beaches\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kamares is the main port of Sifnos and also has one of the island’s best beaches</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cavan Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More and more people are travelling here because of the footpaths...The walkers are extending our tourist season</p> <footer> <cite>Moscha Diareme</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But, slowly, the trails are changing the feast-and-famine nature of tourism on Sifnos, says Moscha Diareme, owner of the <a href=\"https://www.nymfes.gr/\" title=\"\">Nymfes Hotel</a> in the port town of Kamares. “More and more people are travelling here because of the footpaths,” she says. “They arrive in September, after the peak season ends, and they keep coming through June, until it gets too hot to walk and the hotels fill with the other tourists. For the people who come for the beaches, there’s nothing to do here for nine or 10 months of the year. But for people like you, there’s beautiful walking almost all year long.”</p> <p>Diareme noticed the increase in walking-based tourism in 2017. “That year, plus 2018 and 2019, were good years because of the walkers. They’re quiet people, but they still like to wake up in a nice place and eat a good breakfast. When they’re done walking for the day, they still like to relax, go for dinner, and shop. Around here we say, ‘If we have more boats, we have more work.’ Now, because of the walkers, we have more boats – during the off-season. The walkers are extending our tourist season; they’re growing our economy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eada0adef66a10198f058aea465f3d75c498e1cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eada0adef66a10198f058aea465f3d75c498e1cc/0_301_4794_2876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Greek orthodox church of Saint Charalampos in Faros village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The church of Saint Charalampos in Faros village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ioannis Mantas/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, she says, more young people are staying on Sifnos and others, without family connections to the island, are moving here, drawn by the changing economics.</p> <p>Anna Graikou is one of those young people. Born in Thessaloniki, on the mainland, she visited Sifnos in her early 20s. An avid walker, she was captivated by the island and its trails – and stayed. Today she owns and runs a guiding company, <a href=\"https://sifnoshiking.com/en\" title=\"\">Sifnos Hiking</a>. “In a single walk, you can see a Mycenaean acropolis, falcons, eagles and rare flower and tree species. You’re accompanied by the smells of oregano, thyme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jul/07/how-to-grow-summer-savory\" title=\"\">savory</a> and sage.”</p> <p>As with so many we’ve met here, Graikou’s love for Sifnos is infectious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a single walk, you can see a Mycenaean acropolis, falcons, eagles and rare flower and tree species</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Graikou</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The footpaths have always been here, Graikou says. Before roads were built and cars became commonplace, Sifnians used them to travel from village to village, reach the island’s many chapels and churches, and get to their fields. Over the decades, as young people left farming for work in the island’s growing tourist economy, or left the island altogether, many of the pathways fell into disrepair. Few were ever consistently marked or properly mapped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f35025a9ca9b32ba5f2bf8e5daa9e0b3a39d3ea6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f35025a9ca9b32ba5f2bf8e5daa9e0b3a39d3ea6/0_172_5170_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Kamares Bay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of Kamares Bay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EmmePi Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2015, the island’s municipality decided to invest in the trails and promote them to tourists. But first, they had to repair, waymark and map them. For help, they turned to an organisation called <a href=\"https://www.pathsofgreece.gr/en/\" title=\"\">Paths of Greece</a>.</p> <p>Founded in 2010 by Fivos Tsaravopoulos, Paths of Greece works to develop trail networks throughout the country. Tsaravopoulos traces the organisation’s beginnings to 2008 and the island of Kythera, off the southern tip of the Peloponnese peninsula. When he visited to hike the island’s historic pathways, he found many of them neglected and overgrown. “It occurred to me that a vital part of Kythera’s history was disappearing along with the trails,” he says.</p> <p>He approached the Kytherian Foundation for Culture and Development about restoring them. Since then, more than €140,000 has been invested in the island’s pathways. As Tsaravopoulos worked to help Kytherians revitalise their paths, it struck him that myriad ancient trails exist all over Greece and, if developed, could attract hikers and generate a steady, sustainable source of income for rural communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b0f39e8a74defba4d527c0e7dad3180c69019cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b0f39e8a74defba4d527c0e7dad3180c69019cd/0_0_5253_3152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street in Kastro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in Kastro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: vivoo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A study by the Kytherian Foundation showed from 2012 to 2016 the island’s trails generated €1.8m in off-season revenue. “Wherever they are, trail networks stabilise the seasonality of traditional, mass tourism,” says Tsaravopoulos. “People don’t come to walk in summer; they come during the off-season.”</p> <p>Moreover, says Rigas Zafeiriou, programme director for the Kytherian Foundation, walking-based tourism generates money that stays in the community. “We’re seeing that local, family-owned businesses profit from the trails, whereas, for example, package tours, all-inclusive resorts, and cruise ships typically offer fewer benefits to locally owned businesses.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When locals see people walking the trails of their ancestors, they’re inspired to walk them, too</p> <footer> <cite>Rigas Zafeiriou</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The challenges created by mass tourism aren’t limited to economics, Zafeiriou adds, especially given the climate crisis. “Suddenly, instead of 3,000 inhabitants, you have 25,000 and all need a shower and access to potable water. By spreading tourism across the year, we normalise water consumption, and we make better use of existing infrastructure, like hotels and restaurants. To further develop peak-season tourism, you’d need to build more infrastructure. This increases carbon emissions and can result in urban sprawl. We want to reduce emissions and prevent sprawl. The trails help us do all of that.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/aug/25/milos-sifnos-cyclades-greece-mediterranean-aegean-island-hopping\">Odyssey’s end: exploring Milos and Sifnos, Greece</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Sifnos, Paths of Greece worked with the municipality, local people and volunteers to survey, waymark, and rebuild a network of 19 trails. While community interest is vital to the success of each trail project, Tsaravopoulos says, sometimes he’s initially met with scepticism. “Thankfully, it doesn’t last. When locals see people travelling to their region to walk the trails of their ancestors, they’re inspired to walk them too.” Today, hiking clubs have formed on both Sifnos and Kythera; members gather routinely to walk and help maintain the trail systems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7103e4c8f2beb1573fd4c4674679bde8032ea21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7103e4c8f2beb1573fd4c4674679bde8032ea21/662_0_6566_3939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faros is another village reached on superb paths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faros is another village reached on superb paths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rawf8/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the quiet in Kastro, there is life on the island during the week my daughter and I are there. For dinner, we often drive our rental car to the towns of Apollonia or Artemonas which has a solid base of year-round residents, and restaurants, bakeries, and shops are open for business. Our favourite taverna is in Kamares where we also like a shop that sells local honey, sweets, and ceramics. Everywhere we go on Sifnos, waymarked trails cross roads and villages, and we see and meet tourists who are here to explore them.</p> <p>During our walk back to Kastro from Chryssopigi monastery, on the trail marked as a donkey path, my daughter and I do indeed see a donkey, and a white-haired man riding it. Within moments, because this is Greece where people are as warm as the sun, we learn that the 78-year-old travels this path daily to check on his sheep, tend his olive grove and visit a chapel.</p> <p>“I’ve walked this path nearly every day since I was a little boy,” he tells us when I ask him about the island’s trails. “The paths give us olives, they give us milk, cheese, they give us God – and they give us beauty,” he adds, gesturing at the sea. He asks me pointedly, “Do you agree?”</p> <p>I nod enthusiastically. “Oh, yes.

The squirrel made a daily habit of pulling the bird feeders off their hooks to let them smash open on the ground. He stole produce from my vegetable patch and taunted me with it, eating it front of me. If I ignored the taunting he would walk up to my office door and tap on the glass.</p> <p>But he hasn’t been anywhere near my office since October; I never hear him running across the roof any more, or spot him digging holes in the lawn. It could be because the cat has seen him off. Or it could be because the overhanging tree he formerly used as his base of operations was cut down by the neighbours.</p> <p>I don’t know why he left, but I do know where he’s gone: these days he lives out front. Sometimes when I go to the shops I catch him crossing from beneath one parked car to another with a bit of pizza crust in his mouth. When he sees me he freezes in the middle of the road and gives me a look that says: “I’m a completely different squirrel.” And I give him a look that says: “I know it’s you.”</p> <p>It’s none of my business what my enemy the squirrel gets up to in the streets, and I find it difficult to maintain a serious territorial presence in the front garden. I am spending more time in the front, because the bulk of my tomato crop has been rotated there this season, but it’s still a quasi-public space. When I’m out there I can’t really talk to myself, and I feel obliged to wear a shirt.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He gives me a look that says: I’m a completely different squirrel.

It waited a long time before moving aside, as if to make it clear that its decision had nothing to do with me. The back garden may be the leafier of the two spaces, but the true wilderness is out front.</p> <p>When I first saw a tomato lying in the road at the beginning of the month, I ignored it. That could be from anywhere, I thought – a remnant from an unloved takeaway salad. A week before that my wife had claimed someone was breaking her sunflowers in half. I’d said nothing, even though I’d recognised the squirrel’s MO: he climbs the sunflowers to get at the seeds, until his weight snaps the stalk and the whole top half smashes to the ground. A sunflower is basically a bird feeder on a tall stand.</p> <p>On Sunday my wife and I return from somewhere with a car full of stuff. As I heave two bags through the front gate I see it: a large red tomato sitting on the edge of the raised bed with a dozen tiny bites taken out of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/06/tim-dowling-i-try-to-ignore-the-pile-in-the-corner-until-i-realise-it-has-a-face\">Tim Dowling: only when I pull the rug back do I realise we’ve hit a new low | Tim Dowling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is an outrage,” I say.</p> <p>“What is?” My wife says, from behind me.

Directed and hosted by Ethan Hawke, it uses hundreds of hours of transcripts from interviews commissioned by Newman for a biography that never materialised. Modern-day actors play the roles of old movie stars – with George Clooney as Newman and Laura Linney as Woodward – to tell the story of their glamorous lives. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>The Big Breakfast</h2> <h2>10am, Channel 4</h2> <p>Ellie Goulding, Sam Ryder, Chris McCausland, Poppy O’Toole and Fuse ODG join hosts Mo Gilligan and AJ Odudu. Judi Love will also be grilling a guest on her bed, while Melvin Odoom and Harriet Rose have a sausage-eating contest. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Britain By Beach</h2> <h2>8pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Anita Rani returns for a second season of this idyllic journey around the nation’s best seasides. First up: Porthcurno beach on the Cornish coast, where she uncovers Victorian engineering buried in the sand. She then learns about the impact of Cornwall’s “great mining migration” in the 19th century, and even has a go at belly-boarding. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>State of Happiness</h2> <h2>9pm, BBC Four</h2> <p>The late-70s North Sea oil rush is under way as this intriguing Norwegian drama returns for a second series. With opportunity, however, comes a great deal of risk: tonight’s opener begins with an ominous conversation about circumventing safety regulations. Expect politics, profiteering and tragedy to intersect explosively.<em> Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>SurrealEstate</h2> <h2>9pm, Sky Sci-Fi</h2> <p>This thrifty but fun supernatural drama stars Sarah Levy from Schitt’s Creek as the newest hire at a property firm that specialises in flipping haunted houses. Tonight’s double bill kicks off with the Roman Agency’s team of stressed misfits locking down their swanky office to deal with a possession demon. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>The Secrets She Keeps</h2> <h2>9.20pm, BBC One</h2> <p>“Better hope she doesn’t agree to a blood test.” Another deliciously dark wave of subterfuge is afoot, as Agatha (Laura Carmichael) triggers an internal prison investigation to uncover the father of her unborn child. But as Rhea (Jenni Baird) resurfaces with blackmail on her mind, Meghan (Jessica De Gouw) is preoccupied serving up stark ultimatums. <em>Danielle de Wolfe</em></p> <h2><br>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Witness for the Prosecution, 2.35pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>Billy Wilder meets Agatha Christie in court and the verdict is unanimously positive. The 1957 thriller, adapted from Christie’s play, is carried along partly by its twisty plot and partly by Charles Laughton’s twinkly-eyed turn as defence barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts. His interest is piqued by a watertight murder case against poor inventor Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) – and he won’t let a recent heart attack stop him taking the brief. Marlene Dietrich challenges him for star wattage as Vole’s wife Christine, who is strangely indifferent to her husband’s fate … <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <p><strong>Foxtrot, 12.30am, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>War affects two Israeli parents and their soldier son in different ways in a narratively bold drama. Michael (Lior Ashkenazi) and Daphna (Sarah Adler) are devastated after being told their son Jonathan (Yonathan Shiray) has been killed in the line of duty. We then see Jonathan at his desert checkpoint, where the mood is, initially, a bit Catch-22 – a squaddie foxtrots; the barracks slowly sinks into the sand; a camel saunters past. Samuel Maoz’s film encompasses both black comedy and searing grief, while his camera hovers like a military drone, monitoring events. <em>SW</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>European Championships, 9am, BBC Two</strong> Including the men’s 20km walk, team gymnastics and pole vault, women’s 800m and 4x400m relays.</p> <p><strong>Test Cricket: England v South Africa, 10.30am, Sky Sports Main Event</strong> The fourth day of the first Test in the three-match series at Lord’s.</p> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Spurs v Wolves, 11.30am, BT Sport 1</strong> Followed by Bournemouth v Arsenal at 5pm on Sky Sports Main Event.</p> <p><strong>Racing: York Ebor Festival, 1.25pm, ITV</strong> The final day, including the 3.35pm Ebor, plus races at 1.50pm, 2.25pm, 3pm and 4.10pm.</p> <p><strong>Heavyweight Boxing: Oleksandr Usyk v Anthony Joshua, 6pm, Sky Sports Box Office</strong>Joshua fights to regain his IBF, WBO and WBA titles in Saudi Arabia.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/20/blind-date-kat-jack","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Blind date: ‘It’s going to be awkward if he slags me off!’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/20/blind-date-kat-jack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/20/blind-date-kat-jack","fields":{"headline":"Blind date: ‘It’s going to be awkward if he slags me off!’","trailText":"Kat, 28, charity marketing manager, meets Jack, 33, consultant","byline":"","body":"<p><strong>Kat on Jack</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0067bd4aae9efb2651d2d1249033d86e7020f9fb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0067bd4aae9efb2651d2d1249033d86e7020f9fb/1607_1184_1061_1061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br>Good food, good company and, if nothing else, a funny story to tell.</p> \n<p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br>Confident and relaxed.</p> \n<p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br>Alanis Morissette.

It works with <a href=\"https://newquayorchard.co.uk/canteen/\">The Canteen at the Orchard</a>, supplying vegetables in exchange for meals for its volunteers. This symbiotic relationship between farm and restaurant creates a closed loop system that reduces waste by saving surplus produce, such as Hetty’s wheelbarrows full of marrows. A large surplus of any ingredient needs lots of ideas to save it, and marrows are delicious fried, steamed or barbecued, such as in my recipe from a few years ago for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/22/how-to-make-the-most-of-a-marrow-recipe-tom-hunt-waste-not\"> burnt marrow with burnt butter</a>. They also make a delicious, moist and flavourful cake.</p> <p>If you’d like to get ahead, make the cashew cream icing the day before. It’s not essential to soak the cashews before blending them, but it will give them a more satisfying, creamier texture.</p> <p>I use a heritage wholegrain flour such as emmer wheat, einkorn or spelt flour, for flavour, nutrition and planetary health, but regular wholewheat flour will work well, too.</p> <p>For the cashew cream icing<br><strong>250g Fairtrade cashew nuts<br>1 tbsp orange blossom water</strong>, or orange juice<strong><br>¼ tsp sea salt<br>4 tbsp unrefined sugar</strong></p> <p>For the cake<br><strong>130ml extra-virgin olive oil<br>180g unrefined sugar<br>Zest and juice of ½ orange</strong>, plus extra zest to garnish<strong><br>2 tsp psyllium husks<br>350g wholewheat flour<br>2 tsp baking powder<br>2 tsp bicarbonate of soda<br>1 tsp ground ginger<br>1 tsp sea salt<br>100g ground almonds<br>350g marrow</strong>, grated with the skin on, plus extra skin to garnish<br><strong>300ml oat, almond or soya drink<br>2 tsp cider vinegar</strong></p> <p>Make the cashew cream first. Soak the nuts in plenty of cold water for four to eight hours, then drain and blitz in a high-speed blender with the orange blossom water, salt and sugar, until a very thick, double-cream consistency; if need be, add a little extra water (or orange juice) to thin or extra cashews to thicken it. Store in the fridge.</p> <p>Now for the cake. In a large bowl, whisk the olive oil, unrefined sugar and the zest from half an orange. In a second, smaller bowl, mix the psyllium husks with the juice of the half-orange, leave for 30 seconds to coagulate, then whisk into the oil mix until emulsified.</p> <p>Add the flour, baking powder, bicarb, ground ginger, salt, ground almonds, marrow, oat drink and cider vinegar, then mix until well combined. Transfer to a greased and lined 20cm cake tin and bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 45 minutes, or until cooked through.</p> <p>Remove and leave to cool fully in the tin, then turn out and use a palette knife to ice the cake with the cashew cream . Sprinkle a fine grating of both orange zest and marrow skin over the top, slice and serve.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/aug/20/my-life-in-subscriptions-edith-pritchett-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life

Nationwide the figure has slumped to below 2,000, with about 400 of them in the capital.</p> <p>Japan’s postwar economic success gave working-class families the means to buy new homes where they could perform their ablutions in the privacy of their own bathrooms. Now, ageing <em>sento</em> owners are struggling to find successors to take over family-run businesses, while many premises are being swallowed up by rampant redevelopment.</p> <p>The image of a <em>sento</em> as a slightly down-at-heel refuge for older men has long deterred younger customers, while the Covid-19 pandemic and rising fuel prices have only added to the sense that the tradition of <em>hadaka no tsukiai</em> (naked friendship) could one day become a cultural relic.</p> <p>But a small and growing group of proprietors are making <em>sento</em> cool again, by enticing people who may never have experienced the simple pleasure of lowering themselves into piping hot water against the backdrop of a lovingly painted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/07/painters-tokyo-bath-house-murals\">mural of Mount Fuji</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/wearable-fans-help-japans-hot-dogs-beat-the-heat\">Wearable fans help Japan’s hot dogs beat the heat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new breed of sentō are about more than a shower and a soak. The offer post-bath craft beer and pizza made on the premises, music events that take advantage of the bathhouse’s impressive acoustics, early-morning opening times for people who want to bathe before work, saunas, traditional sweets and games for children, and book-lending services for just a few hundred yen a month.</p> <p>“We saw people who were coming to a bathhouse for the first time,” said Sam Holden, an American who in 2020 co-founded <em>Sento</em> <a href=\"https://www.sento-to-machi.org/en\"> &amp; Neighbourhood</a>, a nonprofit that refurbished <a href=\"https://www.sento-to-machi.org/inariyu-en\">Inari-yu</a>, an old bathhouse in northern Tokyo, and turned an abandoned Edo-style row house next door into a space where squeaky clean bathers come to read, have a drink and a snack or take a nap on its tatami-mat floors.</p> <p>Inari-yu now attracts several hundred people a day – a mixture of veterans and younger people – who together bring in just enough income to keep it afloat.</p> <p>“There are a lot of older people in this neighbourhood, so we didn’t want to rebrand the <em>sento</em>, but make it welcoming for regulars and new people alike,” said Holden, who has visited about 200 <em>sento</em> since first encountering them as a graduate student in Tokyo. “You come across a whole section of the population here – men and women, young and old, foreigners and people from different walks of life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80879ae26775a7005a1455d07aebc64549120d1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80879ae26775a7005a1455d07aebc64549120d1c/0_37_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man stands in front of a painting of Mount Fuji\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural of Mount Fuji is standard in many older <em>sento</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Issei Kato/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“They are somewhere to ground yourself in the city. When you go into a bathhouse, you’re in rhythm with other people … there’s a nice feeling about that.”</p> <p>After the coronavirus pandemic hastened the demise of even more bathhouses, those that survived now have to contend with the soaring fuel prices, which forced authorities in Tokyo to raise admission for adults by ¥20 to ¥500 (£3.08) in July.</p> <p>The many challenges have not deterred Sanjiro Minato, who quit his “boring” job as a salaryman and took over the running of the Ume-yu bathhouse in Kyoto in 2015.</p> <p>“I loved going to <em>sento</em> when I was a university student and I was bothered by the fact that they were in decline,” said Minato, who attracted new customers with concerts and flea markets, and promotes <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/umeyu_rakuen\">Ume-yu</a> on Twitter, where it has more than 16,000 followers.</p> <p>When Minato took over the <em>sento</em>, most of his customers were older people; now more than half are in their 20s and 30s. “The problem was that young people didn’t really understand what <em>sento</em> were all about, but social media has helped change that.”</p> <p>Shinobu Machida, Japan’s foremost expert on <em>sento</em>, concedes that ordinary <em>sento</em> will continue to close, but believes revamped bathhouses have a brighter future as their clientele undergo a subtle demographic shift.</p> <p>“Young people are getting more interested in <em>sento</em>, and new owners are trying a fresh approach to keep them on board,” said Machida, who has written several books about Japan’s bathhouses.</p> <p>“Westerners don’t think of a bath in the same way as the Japanese do,” added Machida, who has visited 3,800 bathhouses over the past 40 years. “They think of them as functional, but in Japan a bath has another, equally important role as somewhere to mentally and physically unwind. Bathing in a <em>sento</em> can be a spiritual experience.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/20/tangled-politics-why-shark-nets-are-still-being-used-on-nsw-beaches","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T02:00:27Z","webTitle":"Tangled politics: why shark nets are still being used on NSW beaches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/20/tangled-politics-why-shark-nets-are-still-being-used-on-nsw-beaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/20/tangled-politics-why-shark-nets-are-still-being-used-on-nsw-beaches","fields":{"headline":"Tangled politics: why shark nets are still being used on NSW beaches","trailText":"Experts say ‘nets don’t work’ and the meshing program is in its death throes – so when will there be sufficient political will to scrap them?","byline":"Royce Kurmelovs","body":"<p>It was a six-minute masterclass in the politics of shark nets in New South Wales.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Waverley council mayor, Paula Masselos, <a href=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/opinion/chris-kenny/shark-nets-are-old-technology-and-arent-very-effective/video/7ff0b8e7b0fb50de77e87330e7e2312a\">appeared</a> on Sky News to talk about her opposition to the continued use of shark nets off Sydney’s Bondi beach.</p> <p>Chris Kenny opened the segment by reminding his audience it had been six months since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/fatal-shark-attack-sydney-beaches-closed-as-lifeguards-patrol-for-further-sightings\">a man had been killed by a great white shark</a> off a Sydney beach – 35-year-old diving instructor Simon Nellist, who had publicly opposed shark nets, was attacked at Little Bay.</p> <p>Kenny then peppered Masselos with a series of loaded questions. “Have you told them enough about this?” “Do you believe that your policies reflect the public world?”</p> <p>Masselos attempted to explain her position. Waverely council wanted a better, smarter approach to shark mitigation, one that actually protected people and did not indiscriminately kill marine life.</p> <p>But as she attempted to explain, Kenny cut her off: “Are you prepared to take the nets away and just take the chance we’ll see more fatalities at some of our most popular beaches?”</p> <p>It was a frustrating exchange.

Putin agreed to allow independent inspectors to go to the plant, Macron’s office said, and had “reconsidered” allowing the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency to travel to the facility from Ukrainian territory. </p> \n<p>The Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom said on Friday that it feared that Russia plans to switch off the functioning power units at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which in normal times provides about one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity.</p> \n<p>Russia has controlled the plant in south-east Ukraine since March, although it is still run by Ukrainian scientists. If it stopped generating electricity, its technicians would have to rely on backup power systems to continue cooling the nuclear reactors, which raises the risk of accidents.</p> \n<p>“The Russian military is looking for suppliers of fuel for diesel generators, which must be turned on after the shutdown of power units and in the absence of external power supply for nuclear-fuel cooling systems,” Energoatom said.</p> \n<p>Western officials said they were concerned about whether water cooling could be maintained, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. “[It is] a situation we should all be watching very closely,” said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p> \n<p>A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost in an earthquake, a tsunami that followed overwhelmed backup generators, and the lack of cooling led to a partial reactor meltdown.</p> \n<p>Russia has controlled the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe, since March and stationed troops and military equipment there, leading to urgent calls for it to be demilitarised, including from the UN and Nato.</p> \n<p>The western official said fighting around the plant was considered a lesser risk than a cooling failure, because the nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impact, including that from a passenger jet.</p> \n<p>On Friday Putin renewed Russian accusations that Ukraine was shelling the site, and in the phone call with Macron he said it could lead to “a large-scale catastrophe that could lead to radiation contamination of vast territories”, the Kremlin said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Ukrainian military intelligence had warned this week that Moscow appeared to be planning a “provocation” at the plant, and Energoatom also raised concerns about unusual activity.</p> \n<p>On Friday while the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, visited the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Russia reportedly closed the Zaporizhzhia site to most personnel, apart from those operating the power units, Energoatom said.</p> \n<p>Energoatom also accused Russia of shelling parts of the plant complex in false flag attacks that Moscow blamed on Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s western allies have warned that any nuclear incident would provoke a swift response.</p> \n<p>The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons defence select committee, said on Friday that any nuclear accident at the site risked drawing Nato into the war.</p> \n<p>“Let’s make it clear now: ANY deliberate damage causing potential radiation leak to a Ukrainian nuclear reactor would be a breach of Nato’s Article 5,” he said on Twitter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f4c7059a-a895-4b55-9aba-d53e0e82e43d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3DHxBK_dYX8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Even if the reactors remain intact, however, Russia may plan to weaponise the plant simply by disconnecting it. With winter approaching, and Ukraine already concerned about gas supplies, the plant going offline could be damaging to the economy and people’s ability to stay warm.</p> \n<p>The power it provides would need to be generated at other plants, using up limited supplies of natural gas and other fuels, or the country could face blackouts. And excess heat from the plant is key to regional heating systems.</p> \n<p>The governor of Zaporizhzhia oblast, Oleksandr Starukh, has said that if the plant were to be disconnected, it would leave many of the city’s 700,000 residents without warmth in Ukraine’s bitter winter.</p> \n<p>“The heating system of the city is supplied by the nuclear power plant. So if they turn it off, there’s no way to heat [our buildings]”, he told the Guardian in June. “It’s just a huge problem.”</p> \n<p>Making a major change to operations of a nuclear plant in wartime is dangerous in itself, a senior Ukrainian energy official said. “The problem with Russia is that they’re so reckless,” said Yuriy Vitrenko, the chairman of the gas company Naftogaz, who described Russian actions as “insane”.</p> \n<p>“The nuclear regulator would usually need require you to test something to prove that it’s absolutely safe … it’s not like you cannot experiment with a nuclear power plant. And what they’re doing now is really against all the norms.”</p> \n<p>He said Russia did not fully understand the plant, which is from the Soviet era but has been extensively modernised. That meant the Russian regulator and Russian engineers were not fully up to date on how it works, he said.</p> \n<p>“They can come and see but again, it’s not their plant, so they don’t know everything they need to know about how it operates and what can and should be done with this plant,” he said.</p> \n<p><em>Artem Mazhulin</em><em> contributed reporting on this story</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/who-needs-melanin-how-women-are-embracing-their-grey-hair","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T01:05:06Z","webTitle":"‘#greyhairdon’tcare’: how women are embracing their grey hair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/who-needs-melanin-how-women-are-embracing-their-grey-hair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/who-needs-melanin-how-women-are-embracing-their-grey-hair","fields":{"headline":"‘#greyhairdon’tcare’: how women are embracing their grey hair","trailText":"A Canadian TV anchor has been fired after her hair turned grey.

But Lampard, who has named Gordon in his squad for Saturday’s home game against Nottingham Forest, conceded the boyhood Evertonian’s future will also be influenced by cold business logic.</p> <p>When asked if he would have the final decision on whether to keep or sell the England under-21 international, Lampard replied: “It has to be a joined-up say so. When you’re talking about the level of player Anthony is and the value of the player, we know what those kind of players go for in the modern day if there was ever to be these sort of transfers.</p> <p>“It’s a serious situation on a football level and a club business level, simple as that. If you can join those two up and make the right decision, I will always consider the football one the most important because that is what my job will be judged on. Anthony Gordon is a fantastic player for us and that is why my answer is what it is.” Gordon has not pushed for a move to Chelsea and represents the kind of talent, and character, that Lampard wants to construct a team around at Everton. “I did it at Chelsea,” the manager said. “I brought loads of young players into the team and now they want to take one of my young players. Maybe there is the irony of it.</p> <p>“The reality is, if you play at a high level as Anthony did last season, there may be interest. But Anthony is still a young man, not finding his way exactly as he is in the team now, but he will have ambitions to improve parts of his game this year, international ambitions, all those things.</p> <p>“That will come for Anthony so I think it is understandable that people may be interested in players like that, that’s the way the world works. But I am here as an ambitious young coach myself, so I want to be able to have the best, strongest team and personnel available because I get judged on that. Every coach does. Fortunately, at times you will be as good as your players and Anthony Gordon is a very good player.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04e76b158f6aa53e1943a591ab0d447bd9ed6cd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04e76b158f6aa53e1943a591ab0d447bd9ed6cd7/0_116_3341_2005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dele Alli in action for Everton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dele Alli could be on the move to Turkey this summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dele Alli is also in the squad for the Forest match despite being told Everton will not stand in his way <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/besiktas-want-to-take-struggling-dele-alli-from-everton\" title=\"\">should he wish to join Besiktas</a>. The 26-year-old has made little impact since his move from Spurs in January and Everton are due to pay a £10m instalment on his transfer fee after 20 appearances.

The 22-year-old Ghana international can operate in the No 10 role. The club have reinforced defensively with James Tarkowski and Conor Coady and beat several teams to the £33m signing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/09/everton-bag-rising-belgian-talent-amadou-onana-for-up-to-40m-football\" title=\"\">of Belgium international midfielder Amadou Onana</a>.</p> <p>The search for a much-needed striker remains ongoing, however, while a deal for Idrissa Gana Gueye has stalled and long-time target Morgan Gibbs-White <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/18/nottingham-forest-35m-fee-wolves-morgan-gibbs-white\" title=\"\">has joined Forest</a>. Everton are understood to have failed in a last-minute attempt to hijack his move to the City Ground. Lampard said: “We were well aware of him, he is a very good player, but Nottingham Forest have come in and done the deal so end of story.”</p> <p>Chelsea have several players who remain of interest to their former manager including the striker Armando Broja and the midfielder Billy Gilmour. But Lampard insists any move for a Chelsea player is not dependent on Gordon leaving for Stamford Bridge. “They are separate conversations,” the Everton manager said. “I know the Chelsea players very well. I’ve got one loan left to use for the UK and it is not just Chelsea we are looking in that area for.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/19/thomas-tuchel-dismisses-var-officials-belated-apology-for-missing-foul","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T21:30:21Z","webTitle":"Thomas Tuchel dismisses VAR official Dean’s belated apology for missing foul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/thomas-tuchel-dismisses-var-officials-belated-apology-for-missing-foul","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/19/thomas-tuchel-dismisses-var-officials-belated-apology-for-missing-foul","fields":{"headline":"Thomas Tuchel dismisses VAR official Dean’s belated apology for missing foul","trailText":"Thomas Tuchel said he was unimpressed by the belated apology of the VAR official Mike Dean for missing the foul on Chelsea’s Marc Cucurella","byline":"John Brewin","body":"<p>Thomas Tuchel said he was unimpressed by the belated apology of the VAR official Mike Dean for missing the foul on Chelsea’s Marc Cucurella that preceded Tottenham’s late equaliser in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">last week’s absorbing 2-2 draw</a>.</p> <p>Dean <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11125231/MIKE-DEAN-got-WRONG-Stamford-Bridge-Cristian-Romeros-hair-pull.html\">wrote in his Daily Mail column</a>: “I didn’t deem it a violent act” and that “upon reflection”, he should have asked the referee, Anthony Taylor, to visit his “pitchside monitor to take a look for himself” after Cucurella’s hair was pulled by Cristian Romero, the Spurs defender.</p> <p>“I would not take that amount of time after I made a mistake like this to say I did a mistake,” said the Chelsea manager, who has been handed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/chelsea-complete-12m-casadei-signing-for-inter-on-six-year-deal-football\">a suspended one-game touchline ban</a> for his post-match skirmish with opposite number Antonio Conte, but will be present for Sunday afternoon’s match at Leeds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/chelsea-complete-12m-casadei-signing-for-inter-on-six-year-deal-football\">Chelsea complete £12m Casadei signing while Tuchel is handed one-match ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tuchel added that an official’s apology coming via a paid newspaper column was “a bit strange” but was far more fixated on the decision being “more than just a bad decision”.</p> <p>“In 99% of the decisions we are discussing about handball or not handball, sometimes I don’t understand fully the rules and there are always explanations.

And five medals also represented a hell of a night for Britain.</p> \n<p>It was no surprise to see Muir kick things off with a dominant performance in the 1500m.

The trouble is, trying to stop it.</p> \n<p>Just before the bell she unleashed a kick that could have come with its own GTI injection to leave nearly all her rivals gasping in her slipstream. However Ireland’s Ciara Mageean did mightily well to stick with her until Muir gritted her teeth again with 150m remaining before flying home in 4:01.08.

Just trust your speed and just do damage.”</p> \n<p>Mitchell-Blake also deserves huge credit – not only for winning silver in 20.17 but also for comforting Dobson after he slipped from second to fourth. “I would have loved to share the podium with him,” he said. “He’s got a real dog in him.

This is their fifth win in a row, and while it was far from their most polished, it was perhaps the one that told us the most about what his side are capable of as the playoffs loom large on the horizon.

Furthermore, they had to absorb an extraordinary amount of pressure on their own line to prevent Warrington from scoring again. Time and time again, they survived. And they hung on to win. Because at this time of the year, only one thing really matters: winning – not how you do it, though the ultra-demanding Smith did not quite subscribe to that.</p> <p>“Our attack was appalling in the second half,” he said. “Overall, I thought we were okay.” There is no questioning that six weeks ago, this Leeds side would have collapsed in those final moments, when the pressure was intense. But they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/21/leeds-wigan-super-league-match-report-rugby-league\" title=\"\">have something about them now</a>, and are now up to fifth with three rounds left. Whisper it quietly, but they could even yet catch fourth-placed Catalans. Nobody would have predicted that two months ago, when a relegation battle seemed more likely.</p> <p>“When the scoreboard got tight, there was a lot at stake, but they kept doing their job,” Smith said. “The roar from everyone at the end gave me goosebumps.” That roar came from both the players and the majority of the supporters inside Headingley. Leeds dominated the first half and tries from Ash Handley, Rhyse Martin, Morgan Gannon and Zane Tetevano put them in complete control. At the other end, Warrington could only muster a scrappy try from Riley Dean.</p> <p>At 24-6, you felt if Leeds scored first after half-time, it would have been a comfortable night’s work. But Warrington, to their credit, at least rallied.</p> <p>“I asked the boys to win the second half and keep them scoreless and they did both those things,” their coach, Daryl Powell, said. I’m pleased with a lot of things.” His first year at the Wolves has been a disaster, and their faint playoff hopes were finally extinguished here.</p> <p>But they did show enough in the second half to at least suggest they have some spirit and togetherness, something which has not always been there throughout 2022. They frustrated Leeds offensively, as Smith admitted post-match. And when Wardle and Currie both crossed for tries either side of the hour mark, what felt as if it was going to be a one-sided scoreline at half-time was suddenly in the balance.</p> <p>On countless occasions, Warrington peppered the Leeds line.

The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\">topped 10% for the first time in 40 years</a>.</strong></p></li> \n   <li><p>At the latest hustings in Manchester, Liz Truss sidestepped a question about a 2009 report which she co-authored emerging today which called for doctors pay to be cut by 10%. She said doctors and nurses “feel like they are being told what to do from Whitehall rather than understanding the situation in their local area and being able to respond to their patients’ needs”. The foreign secretary also called for more transparency about the police’s record on fighting crime and having league tables for forces.</p></li> \n   <li><p>At the hustings, Rishi Sunak was asked how he will deal with trade unions and said: “We need to crack on and pass a piece of legislation,” he says, referring to the minimum service bill which means they will not be able to hold the country “to ransom”. On crime, Sunak said he wants a new unit in the National Crime Agency to deal with grooming gangs and says we need to record the ethnicity of perpetrators.</p></li> \n   <li><p>A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised. Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss has been accused of showing “her true colours” in an 2009 paper promoting government spending cuts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/18/liz-truss-called-for-patients-to-be-charged-for-gp-visits-2009-document-reveals\">including slashing doctors’ pay</a>.

The Conservative party has repeatedly targeted unions with criticism, in a move that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/23/union-bashing-government-openly-aggressive-stagflation\">Trades Union Congress has argued is deliberately “picking a fight”</a> for electoral purposes.</p></li> \n   <li><p>The frontrunner to be the UK’s next prime minister has made her views on unions clear: she has approvingly tweeted a report that she intends to make striking more difficult. “New laws will make it harder to call strikes and also guarantee minimum levels of service are maintained on public transport”, according to a report by the Daily Express, a newspaper which is strongly pro-government and is supporting Truss in the Conservative leadership race.</p></li> \n   <li><p>The under-fire rail operator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/avanti-west-coast-reward-failure-says-labour\">Avanti West Coast has been “rewarded for failure”</a>, Labour said, after the company was paid more than £17m in taxpayers’ money by ministers for performance and management fees in just two years, despite being the worst-performing operator on the rail network.

The cash would help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England’s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said.</p></li> \n   <li><p>A green thinktank has criticised Rishi Sunak’s promise to protect farmland from solar farms, saying biofuels use 77 times the amount of arable land. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: “Solar energy isn’t standing in the way of food production in the UK. Instead, solar panels generate cheap, clean energy that doesn’t depend on Russia, and provide income to farmers too.”</p></li> \n   <li><p>Rishi Sunak’s campaign has hit out at frontrunner Liz Truss after she declined to attend a hustings organised by the National Farmers’ Union. Farmers now expect Truss to take part in a hustings with the NFU in September, after she was initially accused of snubbing the organisation by deciding not to attend the event on Friday.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Constituents of the Covid rule-breaking MP Margaret Ferrier are said to be “aghast” that she remains in post, as calls for her to resign gathered pace after she pleaded guilty on Thursday to “culpably and recklessly” exposing the public to the virus.

That is the direction that this is moving in now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Shapps claimed that outdated work practices needed to be updated – a characterisation of the industry that is disputed by the unions, who argue that employers are trying to use modernisation as an excuse to reduce members’ real pay and conditions.

Government lawyers said they were entitled under public records law to withhold the memo because it reflected internal deliberations among lawyers before any formal decision had been reached on what Mueller’s evidence showed.</p> <p>But U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said last year that those arguments were disingenuous because the memo was prepared for Barr at about the same time as a separate Justice Department letter informing Congress and the public that Barr and other senior department leaders concluded that Trump had not obstructed justice.</p> <p>The memo noted that “Mueller had declined to accuse President Trump of obstructing justice but also had declined to exonerate him” and “recommended that Barr ‘reach a judgment’ on whether the evidence constituted obstruction of justice,” the panel wrote Friday. The memo also noted that “the Report’s failure to take a definitive position could be read to imply an accusation against President Trump” if the confidential report were released to the public, the court wrote.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62ffd8dd8f08f8ea5d3a0c26\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-19T18:46:45.185Z\">7.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Busy day for courts in Georgia.

It’s like a CEO promising to rehab a company by focusing on renovating the executives’ parking spaces.”</p> </blockquote> <p>But that doesn’t mean the potent forces working against Biden have gone anywhere, or that voters are necessarily getting over the inflation wave that’s pushed costs up across the economy. It concludes with an anecdote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Earlier this week, I was able to see how this match-up of messages might play out with voters this fall. At a focus group of white male swing voters, the moderator presented a list of Democratic accomplishments, including things like the infrastructure bill, the Recovery Act, and, of course, the newly passed Inflation Reduction Act. Also noted were low unemployment and strong job growth. When asked to respond, a man from Georgia replied, “I don’t disagree with anything here.

They stood up to Big Pharma and passed prescription drug legislation. They stood up to the gun industry and passed gun control legislation. Things that this city [was] unable to deliver on for decades because the special interests had things locked down, Joe Biden and his allies in Congress have been able to deliver on.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The point of interviews like these is to get the administration’s message out ahead of November’s midterms, when voters will get a chance to decide which lawmakers they want representing them, and ultimately which party controls Congress. Considering Biden’s low approval ratings, the base case now is that Republicans have a good shot at taking the House, while Democrats seem favored to narrowly keep the Senate, though anything could happen.</p> <p>The White House would, of course, prefer Democrats hold onto both chambers. If one falls into the hands of the GOP, the prospects for any major legislation getting through Congress become dramatically slimmer for the next two years. Klain and others seem to be hoping that two things will happen: either enough voters change their minds about Biden, or they divorce their dislike of the president from their opinions of Democrats on the ballot. It may be premature to say whether the latter is happening, but when it comes to the former, polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?cid=rrpromo\">does show the president’s approval rating recovering from something of a nadir reached in mid-July</a>.</p> <p>In closing, Klain offered this comment on Biden’s public profile, as compared to the previous White House occupant:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“I don’t think it’s true he’s out there less than his predecessors.

(Barilaro said the stop-work order “concerned me” but his request for a meeting with Chandler was not in relation to the order.)</p> <p>But Chandler had also found himself, through his focus on developments in the Hills district of north-west Sydney, in the middle of an ugly war between the Liberal party’s centre-right and right factions, which have been battling for nearly a decade over control of the Hills district branches of the party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Weekend app\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Over the years there have been allegations of branch stacking by both factions. At least one episode is now the subject of a formal complaint to the NSW Liberal party.</p> <p>The battle intensified when a redistribution of state seats in the area led to one seat held by the centre-right – that of the transport minister, David Elliott – being abolished.</p> <p>How could that involve a building commissioner?</p> <p>Because developers need to pass their projects through local councils, and councillors depend on factions for preselection, just as state MPs do.</p> <h2>Liberal MP points finger at developer</h2> <p>In the lead-up to the 2021 local government elections there was a fierce contest between the factions over who would be endorsed for the Hills shire council, a dispute that came to embroil Chandler through his scrutiny of Toplace, a property developer with significant interests in the Hills district.</p> <p>The acrimony led to allegations in state parliament that the right faction used its numbers on the party’s state executive to oust six councillors, including the Hills shire mayor, Michelle Byrne, and endorse new ones, who were duly elected.</p> <p>In June, the Castle Hill MP Ray Williams, who belongs to the centre-right, raised sensational allegations under parliamentary privilege about what was behind the dumping of the councillors.</p> <p>“Allegations have been raised with me that senior people within the New South Wales Liberal party, a member of the Liberal party state executive and former Hills councillor, were supported financially at the time by a large developer by the name of Jean Nassif, who owns Toplace. Toplace has one of the worst records in the residential building industry,” Williams told parliament.</p> <p>Williams also called for an investigation into the relationship between Toplace and a right faction organiser in the Hills, Christian Ellis.</p> <p>Ellis declined to comment. Beckington, a lobbying firm in which he is a shareholder, was listed as lobbyist for Toplace, though the Guardian understands Ellis himself did not represent Toplace.</p> <p>The allegations Williams raised were sent to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), but it declined to investigate.</p> <p>This week Nassif wrote to the Speaker of the House asking for a citizen’s right of reply to the allegations made by Williams and inviting Williams to repeat them outside parliament so that Nassif could sue him for defamation.</p> <p>In the letter Nassif pointed to the looming preselection problems faced by some MPs aligned with the centre-right as a result of the redistribution as a possible motive for the attacks on him.</p> <p>In an earlier media statement in June, Nassif said he “had never met any of the newly elected councillors on Hills Shire Council or had any involvement with them whatsoever”.</p> <p>Chandler had issued a number of rectification orders against major developments by Toplace in the Hills and other parts of Sydney after his inspections found building defects.</p> <p>That appears to have galvanised the factionally aligned MPs in Macquarie Street into pro- and anti-Chandler forces.</p> <p>In the resignation letter to his boss, Emma Hogan, the secretary of the Department of Customer Service, Chandler wrote: “You are aware of several attempts to attack my character during the challenging circumstances that were confronted by me in the early stages of my work.</p> <p>“The low point of this were the assertions made by Toplace during the course of dealing with serious defects on the Skyview project at Castle Hill.</p> <p>“I understand these assertions were widely circulated with media and politicians.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the developer said in a statement: “Toplace has no idea what David Chandler is referring to [in the letter].</p> <p>“Mr Chandler has made these allegations previously publicly and privately and widely circulated them among the media and politicians.”</p> <h2>Chandler faces internal inquiry</h2> <p>As the letter shows, Chandler believed he had been the subject of a campaign to undermine him for some time.</p> <p>In June he faced an internal departmental investigation after a video emerged in which he told builders he had provided banks with “an informal list of building certifiers” which would lead to “some finding they are unemployable”.</p> <p>The inquiry cleared him of creating a secret list of developers that he supported and of an allegation he had misled parliament, though he was reprimanded for not acting “to the required standard expected of departmental officers”.</p> <p>He wrote in his resignation letter: “I do not accept any inference that I have ever acted unethically in performing my role.”</p> <p>Chandler’s reference in the letter to his “problematic” relationship with Petinos – a member of the right faction – raised eyebrows, since she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/31/nsw-premier-dominic-perrottet-dumps-minister-eleni-petinos-amid-turbulent-period-for-his-government\">sacked from her portfolio</a> by the premier at the end of July, following allegations that she ran an unsafe office, which she denies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/19/hopes-that-emergency-housing-at-flood-site-will-move-after-nsw-premiers-secret-visit\">NSW premier makes secret visit to housing pods being built on flooded land</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The premier, Dominic Perrottet, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/nsw-premier-refuses-to-reveal-why-he-sacked-minister-eleni-petinos\">refused to say exactly why she was dismissed</a>, but denied the decision to remove her from cabinet was related to Chandler’s allegations.</p> <p>The premier has sent the contents of Chandler’s letter to Icac “out of an abundance of caution”.</p> <p>Chandler declined to comment further on any of the matters raised by his letter. More light may be shed on the matter when he appears before a parliamentary committee later this year.</p> <p>We do not know what Petinos said to him during her time as fair trading minister. Nor do we know whether her office queried the rectification orders made against Toplace.</p> <p>Nor do we know how much Chandler knew about the Liberal factional war raging around him. But what is clear from Chandler’s letter is that he did not feel the minister had his back.</p> <p>Petinos did not respond to requests for comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/20/tough-guys-nude-pioneers-and-a-bogan-in-bollywood-nine-sports-stars-who-became-actors","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T20:00:22Z","webTitle":"Tough guys, nude pioneers and a ‘bogan’ in Bollywood: nine sports stars who became actors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/tough-guys-nude-pioneers-and-a-bogan-in-bollywood-nine-sports-stars-who-became-actors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/20/tough-guys-nude-pioneers-and-a-bogan-in-bollywood-nine-sports-stars-who-became-actors","fields":{"headline":"Tough guys, nude pioneers and a ‘bogan’ in Bollywood: nine sports stars who became actors","trailText":"Former AFL star Shane Crawford has some big boots to fill as he enters the world of acting","byline":"Dwayne Grant","body":"<p>Shane Crawford once stood on a stage in the middle of the MCG and told celebrating Hawthorn fans: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FLhYdrXnQc\">That’s what I’m talking about</a>.” Come November, he’ll stand on a stage in Melbourne’s Regent theatre and try to hold his own in an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.</p> <p>“In the past I probably got the gig because I was able to kick a football,” the former AFL star said of being cast as Pharaoh in Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. “[But theatre producers] in America and England have no idea who I am and they’re looking at people as performers.”</p> <p>While cynics may suggest Crawford is kidding himself if he thinks producers were unaware of his footballing roots when casting him in the Melbourne show, he’s not the first athlete to swap the bright lights of sporting stardom for the bright lights of showbiz.

Senior opposition figures are struggling with the unprecedented ministerial finagling by the man who on 21 May they wanted returned as prime minister. </p> \n<p>Labor will keep reminding them of this.</p> \n<p>Of genuine substance are the issues of prime ministerial transparency and accountability, obligations Morrison appeared to discard as he gave himself greater brute power.</p> \n<p>He deliberately did not tell most of his cabinet colleagues he was taking on five additional ministerial authorities, restricting the full details to the governor general, David Hurley, the then deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, prime ministerial staff, two journalists and, potentially, the Queen.</p> \n<p>More important, he didn’t tell the parliament or the people, a violation of important Westminster conventions.</p> \n<p>The process began on 14 March 2020, when Morrison moved into the health ministry, having told the minister, Greg Hunt.

It’s sometimes called viscose, modal, lyocell, tencel, acetate or bamboo. It tends to feel denser and more fluid than cotton or linen, but even this depends on how it’s been extracted and spun.</p> <p>The best way to understand rayon is to consider it an umbrella term for textiles that are made from cellulose, the building block of most plants. It can be extracted from straw, cotton waste and other natural materials, but in the case of rayon, it mostly comes from the wood pulp of pine, eucalyptus or beech.</p> <p>It is often marketed as an eco-friendly fibre because it is made from natural, renewable materials (trees). But, like a lot of sustainable materials, there are a few dark clouds over its credentials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/20/australians-buy-almost-15kg-of-clothes-every-year-and-most-of-it-ends-up-in-landfill-report-finds\">Australians buy almost 15kg of clothes every year and most of it ends up in landfill, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the not-for-profit Canopy, 200 million trees are felled each year to make textiles. Of the 6.5 million metric tonnes of rayon produced every year, almost half comes from ancient and endangered forests.</p> <p>Forests are integral to the fight against global warming because carbon is stored in the woody biomass of tree trunks and branches, and in the roots, shrubs and soil that make up the forest floor. Given the immense beauty of forests, and the plants, animals and birds they provide homes to, the link between rayon and deforestation is a particularly sad truth and one of fashion’s best disguised secrets.</p> <p>Amanda Carr, senior lead on the CanopyStyle campaign, says in this forest-based fabric supply chain there is an opportunity to steer investments towards solutions and away from problems. “It is like we are standing on a cliff edge and we have an opportunity to build a fence at the top versus a hospital at the bottom.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c64c8730f5d26c7193c35d56fdf99f2c2bfc702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c64c8730f5d26c7193c35d56fdf99f2c2bfc702/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pink fabric\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">According to Canopy, 200 million trees are felled each year to make textiles (beautiful as they are).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hazardous waste turned the river water dark red</h2> <p>Production of rayon has approximately doubled in the last three decades and its percentage of the global fibre market is continuing to grow (in 2019 it was 6.4%). Carr says Canopy is working to ensure this growth is not facilitated by further deforestation. Their work is at least partially responsible for the many fashion brands describing their rayon, viscose or modal products as FSC or PEFC certified – meaning it has come from a sustainably managed forest or plantation.</p> <p>The carbon footprint of rayon is further complicated by the process of turning wood into a textile. Unlike cotton, wool or silk, which come out of nature smooth, elastic and ready to be spun, converting a tree into fabric can be highly toxic to both workers and the environment.</p> <p>Rayon also has links to some of the world’s darkest history. In the midst of the second world war, the Nazis forced prisoners to labour in rayon factories. There are accounts of the chemicals (sulphuric acid) burning holes in their uniforms, causing injuries anywhere it touched the skin, while emissions resulted in neurological side effects like blindness and psychosis.</p> <p>These issues have persisted into the 21st century. A 2017 report by the <a href=\"https://changingmarkets.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ENGLISH_DIRTY_FASHION_EX_SUMMARY_FINAL_SPREAD_PAGE_WEB.pdf\">Changing Markets Foundation</a> found visible and highly odorous pollution on production sites in India that belonged to the Aditya Birla Group – the world’s biggest viscose producer.</p> <p>Hazardous waste had turned the river water dark red; an independent laboratory test revealed that the air had 125 times the level of carbon disulphide recommended by the WHO; the surrounding villages did not have access to safe drinking water and, in one alarming instance, 60 villagers fell seriously ill and lost the ability to walk. Aditya Birla Group denied that these problems were linked to their operations.</p> <p>However, similar problems have been reported across China and other parts of India and Indonesia – and the issues are not limited to one company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/nov/21/we-are-five-to-10-years-behind-long-road-ahead-for-solving-australias-textile-waste-crisis\">‘We are five to 10 years behind’: long road ahead for solving Australia’s textile waste crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Changing Markets Foundation report made several recommendations on how to make viscose rayon production more sustainable, with a specific focus on air pollution, water pollution, disposal of solid waste, energy sources, energy consumption and workers’ health and safety. The foundation suggested implementing closed-loop manufacturing to ensure the waste from the chemicals was recovered and recycled where possible, and that the exhaust air was condensed and captured to recover the emissions of carbon disulphide and reuse it.</p> <p>By 2020 ​​Aditya Birla Group announced that it has set a target for all of its manufacturing sites to be compliant with EU BAT standards and verified by the end of 2022.</p> <p>Kathleen Rademan, innovation platform director at Fashion for Good, says “manufacturers responsible for 50% of global viscose production have committed to responsible production”. She points to Spinnova and Infinited Fiber Company as examples of companies who implement best practice chemical management. Lenzing, one of the biggest viscose producers in the world, has trademarked Tencel which is also made using closed loop processes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ac1c7954f576ab34fcef4ecd2576884977594d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ac1c7954f576ab34fcef4ecd2576884977594d0/0_0_6000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Art deco pattern for fabric. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Art deco pattern for fabric.

Certifications are widely considered good, if imperfect, tools to set standards across different countries for responsible forest management. Most significantly, they guarantee traceability to ensure the source of the rayon was not an ancient or endangered forest.</p> <p>Pointing to the fact that trees and forests are a significant aid against a warming planet, Carr says Canopy’s priority is to ensure no viscose rayon sourcing occurs in ancient or endangered forests.</p> <p>But she notes certifications are constrained by scale. Each one is applied from a local viewpoint, and often the ecological considerations or planetary needs demand a more global or regional perspective. “This is not the kind of planning that voluntary certifications applied by individual corporations accomplishes,” she says.</p> <p>The next step is to find sourcing solutions to replace fibre from forests altogether.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c81b4557ff1177dc9e24c61912b97b3991fbf5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c81b4557ff1177dc9e24c61912b97b3991fbf5f/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ball of cotton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theoretically all natural fabrics and even agricultural waste could be regenerated into viscose rayon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tetiana Garkusha/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Turning old textiles into new</h2> <p>Any plant-based material can potentially serve as a source of cellulose and be dissolved to make fibres, so theoretically all natural fabrics and even agricultural waste could be regenerated into viscose rayon.</p> <p>According to Textile Exchange, the market share of ‘recycled’ cellulose fibres is very small, but a lot of ongoing research and development means it is expected to increase significantly in coming years. Recent technological advancements have made it possible to convert some textile waste into new materials.</p> <p>The process can be much more efficient than converting trees because of the high cellulose content of some fibres, such as cotton. According to Canopy, on average it takes 2.5–3 tonnes of trees to create 1 tonne of viscose pulp, but it takes only about 1 tonne of recycled cotton or rayon to make 1 tonne of viscose pulp. Given this, Rademan says, “it makes more sense to try to valorise the resources we already have via textile-to-textile recycling” instead of relying on virgin resources like trees.</p> <p>Considering the amount of textile waste sent to landfill every second, the notion that we can turn old textiles into new textiles with superior performance properties to synthetics is extremely interesting. Viscose is better on the body than synthetics; it breathes against the skin and does not have a complicated relationship with oil or sweat, which makes it nicer to wear. And it doesn’t shed plastic microfibres into waterways every time it is washed.</p> <p>While we are in the early days of these solutions, with large-scale infrastructure required for collection, sortation and recycling, there are already innovators operating in this space. Lenzing’s Refibra line is made of approximately 30% recycled cotton.</p> <p>Seattle based company Evrnu launched a fabric called NuCycle that is made from recycled textile waste in April of this year. And in May, fast-fashion giant Inditex invested €100 million in Infinited Fiber, a Finnish startup that also creates fabrics from textile waste.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8baf66ef135c4ef63951ccac182eb88e32ee0021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8baf66ef135c4ef63951ccac182eb88e32ee0021/0_0_903_1382/653.jpg\" alt=\"Sundressed cover.\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sundressed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Black Inc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite viscose rayon’s dark and complex history, which in many ways extends into the present, it could have a hopeful future.</p> <p>If we can eliminate trees and forests from its sourcing, replace them with textile waste, and further innovate production to be closed loop and non-toxic, viscose rayon could truly earn the eco-friendly reputation it has already been given.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>This is an edited extract of Lucianne Tonti’s <a href=\"https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/books/sundressed\">Sundressed: Natural Fibres and the Future of Fashion</a> published by Black Inc. and out now</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/19/marcus-rashford-has-drifted-from-young-striking-sensation-to-huffing-workhorse","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T20:00:21Z","webTitle":"Marcus Rashford has drifted from young striking sensation to huffing workhorse | Jonathan Liew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/marcus-rashford-has-drifted-from-young-striking-sensation-to-huffing-workhorse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/19/marcus-rashford-has-drifted-from-young-striking-sensation-to-huffing-workhorse","fields":{"headline":"Marcus Rashford has drifted from young striking sensation to huffing workhorse","trailText":"As Manchester United managers have come and gone, his chance to join the elite will have to happen somewhere else","byline":"Jonathan Liew","body":"<p>“You’re running too much,” Louis van Gaal told Marcus Rashford. It was half-time in Manchester United’s Europa League game against Midtjylland, and one of the world’s most celebrated coaches was trying to impart a few words of wisdom to the 18-year-old striker making his first-team debut.</p> <p>“Stay between the width of the six-yard box,” he assured Rashford, “and you’ll score.” In the second half, Rashford took Van Gaal’s advice on board. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/25/manchester-united-midtjylland-europa-league-match-report\">He was rewarded with two close-range goals</a>, United won 5-1 and Van Gaal had seen enough to hand Rashford a Premier League debut against Arsenal that weekend. Rashford would finish the season with eight goals, a place in Roy Hodgson’s Euro 2016 squad, but above all the impression that this teenage sensation could be anything he wanted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/jurgen-klopp-unhappy-with-gabriel-agbonlahor-suggestion-erik-ten-hag-just-pack-up\">Klopp unhappy with Agbonlahor’s suggestion that Ten Hag ‘just pack up’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Van Gaal was clear about Rashford’s role in the side. “He is a real striker,” he said. “He can make goals, but he’s also an attacking point and he also runs the channels.” Unfortunately, United were about to sack Van Gaal and hire a coach who had a very different idea of the centre-forward role, and Rashford’s suitability to occupy it.</p> <p>José Mourinho demands strikers with presence, preferably height, and the ability to play with their back to goal. Zlatan Ibrahimovic arrived at United in Mourinho’s first season and Romelu Lukaku in his second. Rashford, by contrast, found his minutes carefully rationed, his role reimagined as a winger or occasionally as a second striker.</p> <p>In interviews, Mourinho also made it clear where he felt Rashford’s strengths lay. “I am not going to say he cannot ever be a number nine,” he said. “He can be dangerous in transitions. Playing from the sides he can be a very good player, probably better than at nine. But he feels he is a No 9.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60a9d8463eddcdf3cc8243443ddd6a5b23cd05b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60a9d8463eddcdf3cc8243443ddd6a5b23cd05b2/0_30_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Marcus Rashford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Marcus Rashford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so before he had even turned 21, Rashford found himself splintered between at least two or three different roles, never quite getting a run in any of them. Mourinho was followed by Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who initially deployed Rashford up front before moving him to the left wing. In tandem with Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, and later Edinson Cavani, Rashford enjoyed the most prolific spell of his career between 2019 and 2021, scoring 43 goals in all competitions.</p> <p>At which point: enter Cristiano. The return of Ronaldo in the summer of 2021 was a source of genuine excitement to Rashford. And yet in retrospect it appears to be the moment at which he began to lose his way: trapped in a failing team and a gummed-up system that on almost every measurable level was slowing and stultifying, narrowing its horizons, blunting its attacking threat to a single fixed point.</p> <p>Rashford began last season still traumatised by his crucial penalty miss in the Euro 2020 final and recovering from shoulder surgery. He returned to a team in chaos. The improvisation of the Solskjær era was giving way to the interim weirdness of Ralf Rangnick, and so in his seventh season as a professional Rashford would become acquainted with the largely novel concept of pressing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/erik-ten-hag-defends-glazers-manchester-united-ownership\">‘They want to win’: Erik ten Hag defends Glazers’ Manchester United ownership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last season at United has generally been interpreted as a form of sharp regression for Rashford, which it was in all respects but one. His goals were down, his assists were down, shots were down, and so were his touches in the final third. But curiously he made more tackles and interceptions than in any season since his debut. In a way, the evolution was complete: together, four managers over six years had managed to convert England’s most exciting young striker into a huffing midfield workhorse.</p> <p>Of course, Rashford’s coaches are by no means entirely to blame. In large part the confusion over Rashford’s role is one engendered by Rashford himself, who since his academy days has never seemed entirely certain of the sort of player he wanted to be. “I always tried to train myself to play in all three positions up front,” he has said. “If you have a player who can play in more than one position, you’re more likely to be involved.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ecc66d58d483672198da586c0c6158390767e56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ecc66d58d483672198da586c0c6158390767e56/69_0_2845_1707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Rashford celebrates after scoring against Midtjylland at Old Trafford in February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Rashford celebrates after scoring against Midtjylland at Old Trafford in February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this really strikes at the heart of the Rashford conundrum. Rangnick’s frequent frustration at Rashford’s apparent inability to follow a tactical plan is hardly surprising when you consider that he has barely received a tactical education worthy of the name. In essence and spirit, he is the same player he was at 18: eager, selfless, supremely talented and keen above all to get involved, running far too much for far too little.</p> <p>The best strikers thrive on ego and arrogance, a belief in their own primacy. Perhaps this is the part that has always come hardest to Rashford. In many ways there are parallels here with Wayne Rooney, another player who wanted to do it all and who thus required a little honing, a little recalibration, a coach who could give him a distinct role and time to make it his own.</p> <p>Rashford never really had that. These should have been his peak years, and instead he has spent them constantly shifting and readapting, isolated by a lack of world-class coaching, a lack of vision, a chronic short-term mentality. This again has been evident in the panicked reaction to the club’s poor start: demands for resets and revolutions, for ripping everything up and starting again, for frantic last-minute signings: Álvaro Morata, Yannick Carrasco, Christian Pulisic, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.</p> <p>How much more of his prime is Rashford prepared to devote to this queasy television gameshow? His England place has already gone; his participation in the World Cup unlikely. There is talk of a potential move to Paris Saint-Germain, who may simply order a different flavour of chaos, but at least have a coach in Christophe Galtier with a proven track record of improving young forwards such as Victor Osimhen and Nicolas Pépé. For years Rashford appeared to be on a similar trajectory: on the verge of the great leap that would catapult him into the elite.

Joshua was 22 then, clean shaven and full of hope for the future, a future that has seen him amass riches and memories beyond his wildest dreams. But right now there may well be a part of him that wishes he could return to those giddy and largely carefree amateur days.</p> \n<p>Equally, Joshua is likely to feel proud of what he’s achieved since stepping into the limelight of professional boxing in 2013. The plan was to become a world champion within four years – he achieved it in three in only his 16th fight, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/09/anthony-joshua-wins-ibf-world-heavyweight-title-against-charles-martin\" title=\"\">victory over Charles Martin</a> at the 0<sub>2</sub> Arena in April 2016. A little over a year later came his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/anthony-joshua-beats-wladimir-klitschko-wembley-heavyweight-champion-round-11\" title=\"\">11th-round stoppage of Wladimir Klitschko</a> in front of a postwar record crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium. It was an epic moment that fully established Joshua as one of the biggest names in British sport, let alone boxing, able to consistently sell out stadiums and win while doing so. Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker and Alexander Povetkin were all beaten in front of huge crowds, at home as well as in the stands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0112d508b4bab12cb2950d6ab4c12fbce1fe043c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0112d508b4bab12cb2950d6ab4c12fbce1fe043c/0_13_2371_1422/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oleksandr Usyk lands a punch during his win over Anthony Joshua at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oleksandr Usyk lands a punch during his win over Anthony Joshua at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But then came defeat to the little-known and, to put it politely, poorly conditioned Andy Ruiz Jr at Madison Square Garden in June 2019. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/01/anthony-joshua-andy-ruiz-jr-boxing-heavyweight-title-fight\" title=\"\">The seventh-round stoppage</a> was a shock to Joshua’s system in more ways than one, and while he got revenge with a unanimous points victory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/07/anthony-joshua-goes-distance-win-world-titles-andy-ruiz-jr-points-unanimous-decision-boxing\" title=\"\">in their rematch</a> in Diriyah six months later, the sheen that comes with being an imperious, undefeated champion had been dimmed. And that to a large extent is why Joshua finds himself back in Saudi Arabia now, desperately seeking a victory that, given the opponent and circumstances, would re-establish him as a heavyweight for the ages.</p> \n<p>For that to happen Joshua has accepted he needs to go back to basics, hence enlisting the help of Garcia and focusing on claiming the centre of the ring and making full use of his formidable size, range and power. It is what Joshua does best and is, in truth, all he can do given his lack of technical ability on the back as well as front foot. Yet as much as that may be a negative it also speaks to the remarkable trajectory of Joshua’s career, the boy from a troubled background in Watford who was propelled into the glitz and glory of professional boxing by dint of becoming an Olympic hero, and who essentially had to learn on the job given he left the amateur ranks with only 35 fights to his name.</p> \n<p>He learned what he could, soared high and, as perhaps was inevitable for someone so raw, crashed twice along the way. A third crash this weekend amid the burning glow of a Middle Eastern night is perhaps unavoidable given the brilliance of the man he is facing, and for all of Joshua’s insistence to the contrary, it could well prove the end. If so, it will at least have been a journey like no other.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/20/railing-against-rail-loop-put-matthew-guy-back-on-track-but-theres-a-long-way-to-go","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T20:00:21Z","webTitle":"Railing against rail loop put Matthew Guy back on track - but there’s a long way to go","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/20/railing-against-rail-loop-put-matthew-guy-back-on-track-but-theres-a-long-way-to-go","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/20/railing-against-rail-loop-put-matthew-guy-back-on-track-but-theres-a-long-way-to-go","fields":{"headline":"Railing against rail loop put Matthew Guy back on track - but there’s a long way to go","trailText":"With 14 weeks until the Victorian state election, the opposition has a mountain to climb in order to form government","byline":"Benita Kolovos","body":"<p>Victoria’s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, effectively fired the starter’s gun on the state election campaign this week when he announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/matthew-guy-pledges-to-shelve-345bn-rail-project-to-invest-in-healthcare\">the Coalition would shelve the Suburban Rail Loop</a> – the largest infrastructure project in the history of the state – if it wins in November.</p> <p>After two weeks of negative headlines about a proposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/02/matthew-guys-chief-of-staff-quits-over-proposal-for-party-donor-to-pay-his-company-directly\">donation </a>scheme, which prompted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/10/victorian-opposition-leader-loses-second-senior-staff-member-in-a-week\">resignations of several key members of his team</a>, Guy’s announcement seized back the initiative.</p> <p>But it will be a marathon not a sprint to the finish line for the opposition, with political experts and the bookies giving it little chance of forming government in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/18/digging-in-matthew-guys-gamble-on-scrapping-victorias-suburban-rail-loop\">Digging in: Matthew Guy’s gamble on scrapping Victoria’s suburban rail loop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labor won the 2018 election in a landslide – or “Danslide” – securing more than 57% of the two-party-preferred vote and leaving the Coalition with just 27 of the 88 seats in the lower house.</p> <p>To win outright, the Coalition need a net gain of 18 seats. Adding to its woes, it will enter the race in a worse position than it was then, thanks to an electoral redistribution that sees Labor gain two net seats, based on the 2018 vote.</p> <p>Election analyst Ben Raue says the path to victory for the opposition is narrow.</p> <p>“Even if we had a significant swing to the opposition, because they did so badly in 2018, there’s a large buffer for Labor.

But since when was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGrniCrIHGg\">writing in character</a> a problem for Ray Davies?

He fears a modern sighting would be perceived as a potential goldmine, with scientific protocols abandoned in the rush to cash in.</p> \n<p>“The Naarding case was pre-social media – and social media, as we’ve seen many times with this issue, dominates it completely.

In the Western Australian museum, you can see a mummified specimen that once hunted on today’s Nullarbor plain. </p> \n<p>Some have suggested that the creatures may have been introduced from Tasmania to other states in the late 19th or early 20th century. It’s known that the naturalists of the Acclimatisation Society of Victoria sought to introduce to the colony “all innoxious animals, birds, fishes, insects and vegetables, whether useful or ornamental”. For the most part, the society imported European species (one report proclaimed proudly that the rabbit had been “so thoroughly acclimatised that it swarms in hundreds in some localities”). Yet it also took an interest in native animals, and thylacine enthusiasts have uncovered an Argus article from 1868 with a tantalising reference to acclimatisation breeding farms containing “a tiger rat, a Tasmanian wolf and two Tasmanian devils”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9899e955707d8de18271ce3950dee35097e2d935\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9899e955707d8de18271ce3950dee35097e2d935/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thylacine rock art at Deep Gorge in the Pilbara, Western Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thylacine rock art at Deep Gorge in the Pilbara, Western Australia.

One witness described it as “a strange animal with a blood-curdling yell … with large claws, large head, furry body striped like a zebra, and a long tail”.</p> \n<p>These and other stories circulate widely on the many online thylacine forums and Facebook groups, though most scientists don’t give them much credence. </p> \n<h2>Destroyed by decree</h2> \n<p>Today, the rediscovery – or re-creation of the thylacine – would generate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/de-extinction-scientists-are-planning-the-multimillion-dollar-resurrection-of-the-tasmanian-tiger\">worldwide headlines</a>. By contrast the last thylacine’s death did not generate any headlines at all.</p> \n<p>As the writer Nicholas Shakespeare<a href=\"https://www.penguin.com.au/books/in-tasmania-9780143790945\"> points out</a>, on 8 September 1936, the Hobart Mercury said nothing at all about how, on the previous day, the female thylacine known as Benjamin had perished after being inadvertently locked out of her cage in the old Beaumaris zoo on a freezing Tasmanian night.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/20/scientists-picking-over-ice-age-bones-discover-vultures-once-soared-in-australias-skies\">Scientists picking over ice age bones discover vultures once soared in Australia’s skies</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rather than recording what now seems an environmental calamity of almost epochal proportions, the paper concerned itself with the “unseemly conduct” at the Bothwell Hall during a recent concert, noting with disapproval the “empty liquor bottles … found in the dressing rooms”.</p> \n<p>The Mercury’s indifference reflects, of course, a colonial indifference to antipodean ecology, one deeply enmeshed with the broader project of white settlement.</p> \n<p>Indigenous lore gave the Aboriginal Tasmanians a demonstrably higher standard of living than most early modern Europeans. Yet, when the British established their military outpost on the Derwent River in 1803, they classed the natives as crude primitives, dismissing as worthless a culture they could not understand. As an 1820 visitor to Hobart remarked, “[t]he aborigines of this island are supposed [by white settlers] to be the most degraded of any known in the world”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75d8cbff6bf07723c4fffaf343e5f5aeb6f00c75\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75d8cbff6bf07723c4fffaf343e5f5aeb6f00c75/173_165_3651_4905/744.jpg\" alt=\"A Tasmanian hunter with a thylacine in 1925.\" width=\"744\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tasmanian hunter with a thylacine in 1925.

The white press became openly genocidal: the Colonial Advocate called for Indigenous people to be “exterminated or removed”, the Colonial Times urged the “annihilation of the whole race” and the Tasmanian declared “extermination […] the only remedy”.</p> \n<p>Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Aboriginal people were killed – and those that survived were forcibly transferred to a bleak reservation on Flinders Island. In many ways, the subsequent war against the thylacine mirrored that earlier campaign against Indigenous people. Just as Tasman’s fascination with the unknown southern land’s enigmatic people gave way to a British scorn for Aboriginal “backwardness”, curiosity about the mysterious tiger became overt contempt for an animal blamed for thinning the settlers’ flocks.</p> \n<p>The colonists spoke variously of “a Tasmanian wolf, a Tasmanian hyena, a Tasmanian zebra, a Tasmanian dingo, a Tasmanian panther and a dog-faced dasyure”. Whatever it was, they wanted it gone.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We’ve still got the devil, we’ve still got other animals but not the thylacine … and we were just so close</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Barry Brook, environmental scientist</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Towards the end of the Black Wars, the authorities proclaimed Government Order No 2, offering “a reward of £5 […] for every adult aboriginal native and £2 for every child, who shall be captured and delivered alive to any of the police stations”. To destroy the thylacine, they used a similar expediency. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1609359.Thylacine\">As historian David Owen notes</a>, by 1830, the Van Diemen’s Land Company was offering a reward for the killing of “noxious animals”, a category under which it listed the “hyena”.</p> \n<p>In 1882, a Mercury headline promised “Tiger Extermination”, as landowners in Buckland discussed wiping out both thylacines and eagles, with “a reward of £5 to be paid for each full-grown tiger caught in the district, and £2 10s, for all cubs equal in size to a full-grown domestic cat, the skins of all the animals caught to become the property of the association”.</p> \n<p>A few years later, the politician John Lyne – a representative of the Tasmanian rural lobby – proposed the government bounty that constituted an official death sentence. In the debate at the House of Assembly, Lyne claimed, quite preposterously, that “30 000 or 40 000 sheep” were taken each year by the animals he described as “dingoes” and “one of the greatest pests the colony had”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Get the weekend app\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Scientists estimate the total thylacine population pre-white settlement as perhaps 5,000. Between 1888 and 1909, the authorities paid so-called “tiger men” for 2,184 carcasses – a figure that doesn’t include the separate rewards offered by local farmers.</p> \n<p>In 1902, hunters claimed 119 skins. Four years later, the figure had fallen to 59. The next year, it was two – and, after that, thylacines had become so rare that no one delivered hides at all.</p> \n<p>In 1914, the biologist Prof Thomas Flynn (father of the Hollywood swashbuckler Errol Flynn) warned that thylacines faced extinction. But nothing came of his call for a sanctuary’s establishment. Legislation protecting the species only passed the Tasmanian parliament in 1936 – and, by then, just one animal remained.</p> \n<p>Today, National Threatened Species Day falls on 7 September, the anniversary of Benjamin’s lonely death outside her cold, concrete cage.</p> \n<h2>‘We all have to be sensible if it gets found’</h2> \n<p> “On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,” says Nick Mooney, “I think the interest in the thylacine is a positive and on the other days I think it’s a distraction. I’ve had to make the decision as to whether, in my own small way, I keep servicing it. But there is a slim possibility the animal’s still there – pretty slim but a possibility. And so you have to remind people that we all have to be sensible if it gets found.”</p> \n<p>But, yes, he does worry that an obsessive focus on rare, endangered animals obscures more systemic problems. “I’ve always been interested in birds of prey,” he says. “When people ask me about my favourite, they always expect something incredibly rare and exotic like the harpy eagle. But my favourite bird is the common brown falcon because you see it every day and so you can get to know it really well. What’s the point of having a favourite bird that’s so rare that it’s almost just an idea?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a0c65d39974a54c2de5a9d804ff7b5f8227a4451\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0c65d39974a54c2de5a9d804ff7b5f8227a4451/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tasmanian Tiger statue in Civic Square near the town hall in Launceston, Northern Tasmania\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The thylacine is immortalised in a statue in Launceston’s Civic Square. Statistical analysis suggests that a remnant population probably survived in remote areas until at least the late 80s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On that basis, he proposes supplementing Threatened Species Day with Common Species Day. “Exactly the polar opposite in the year, six months away – a day we look at all the common animals that actually drive the ecology. We tend to know the most about the rarest animals and the least about the most common, even though you can argue, from a simple ecological point of view, the most common animals are the most important.”</p> \n<p>Environmental scientist Barry Brook from the University of Tasmania sees the matter somewhat differently. The popular attachment to certain animals cannot and should not be ignored, he says, not least because, when iconic species die, the public – quite understandably – despairs. “It has a depressive effect. People think, well, you can’t even be bothered to save these things we really care about, so why should we invest emotionally in anything else?”</p> \n<p>Conversely, the allure of particularly exotic animals – and what could be more exotic than a thylacine? – serves, at least potentially, as a force multiplier, creating environmental opportunities that may not otherwise exist. For instance, a rejuvenated thylacine population would, almost by definition, require a rejuvenated habitat, which would assist all manner of other creatures.</p> \n<p>“If you found a handful of thylacines, you’d want to restore them to being thousands of thylacines. You’d want to get them back to their former ecological position and that would involve investments in habitat protection and restoration and connectivity: all the issues that go along with restoring a wide-ranging predator. That brings benefits for other species, the other mammals and birds that need habitat protection, as well as the invertebrates and the fungi and the mosses and all the other things that are otherwise invisible.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/09/csiro-researchers-identify-139-new-species-including-an-ant-that-babysits-caterpillars\">CSIRO researchers identify 139 new species, including an ant that ‘babysits’ caterpillars</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It would be foolish, Brook says, not to harness the undeniable pull of charismatic animals. He points out that prior to colonisation, Tasmania possessed its own distinctive emu, a smaller subspecies isolated from the rest of the population during the Late Pleisotocene. Within 30 years of white settlement, the emus were gone, wiped out so thoroughly that we lack even basic information about where and how they lived.</p> \n<p>Some scientists think that, because collectors sought the more exotic variant, the Tasmanian bloodline might persist in overseas zoos and could, perhaps, be recovered through selective breeding. Whether that’s true or not, the re-introduction of emus (even mainland ones) would almost certainly benefit the environment, since the birds probably played an important ecological role in distributing seeds.</p> \n<p>Yet the restoration of emus would require active community support – and, for the moment, no one can guarantee that such support would be forthcoming, precisely because Tasmanians don’t have any emotional attachment to the species.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Thylacines would be different. The worldwide interest in a recovered thylacine population would, almost certainly, inspire locals, with ordinary people volunteering to do whatever is necessary for the animals to flourish. That enthusiasm might set a precedent. You could imagine that farmers newly accustomed to living with the once-hated Tasmanian tigers might, perhaps, warm to the prospect of emus once again striding over a rewilded landscape.</p> \n<p>Mind you, none of that implies that Brook expects a healthy thylacine to surface any time soon. <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427214v1\">In a recent academic paper</a>, he and his colleagues pored over every thylacine sighting documented since poor Benjamin’s demise. Their statistical analysis suggests that a remnant population most likely survived in remote areas for several decades – but then, heartbreakingly, faded away, probably some time between the late 1980s and the early 2000s.</p> \n<p> So what makes a once-despised creature so attractive?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8b6cf4aa70d9b30600633a874adb54882d52a53\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8b6cf4aa70d9b30600633a874adb54882d52a53/0_0_4567_6929/659.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Provocations, by Jeff Sparrow\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Brook wonders if the answer lies in a perception of an avoidable tragedy. “This is effectively a member of the Pleistocene megafauna that survived the extinction even 40,000 years ago – and then we lost it in the 20th century. We’ve still got the devil, we’ve still got other animals but not the thylacine … and we were just so close.”</p> \n<p>Mooney thinks the “tiger” nomenclature makes the difference, invoking an animal whose fearful symmetry resonates in both western and eastern mythology. “I’m convinced,” he says, “that if it was called by its Aboriginal name, we wouldn’t be having this discussion because no one would care less.”</p> \n<p><em>This is an edited extract from Provocations – New and Selected Writing, by Jeff Sparrow, published by New South</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/19/electric-vehicles-four-things-that-will-help-australia-shift-gears-after-a-decade-of-denial","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T20:00:20Z","webTitle":"Electric vehicles: four things that will help Australia shift gears after a ‘decade of denial’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/electric-vehicles-four-things-that-will-help-australia-shift-gears-after-a-decade-of-denial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/19/electric-vehicles-four-things-that-will-help-australia-shift-gears-after-a-decade-of-denial","fields":{"headline":"Electric vehicles: four things that will help Australia shift gears after a ‘decade of denial’","trailText":"Here’s what we learned from the first national EV summit","byline":"Peter Hannam","body":"<p>Australia is changing lanes and embracing electric vehicles.</p> <p>That was the message from the nation’s first Electric Vehicle Summit in Canberra on Friday. </p> <p>With speakers ranging from Robyn Denholm, the chair of Tesla, to Mike Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of Atlassian and Paul Sansom, the chief executive of Volkswagon Australia, the summit had a lot of ground to cover and a big void to fill. </p> <p>Here are four things we learned:</p> <h2>There is hope for EVs in Australia</h2> <p>The climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announced plans for a discussion paper next month to develop an EV strategy and explore “options for the introduction of fuel efficiency standards”. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/bank-australia-to-steer-customers-towards-electric-vehicles-with-halt-to-loans-for-fossil-fuel-cars-in-2025\">Bank Australia to ditch fossil fuel car loans in push for EV future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the consultation would usher in “a time of hope, that after a decade of denial and delay, after an era of demonisation of innovations like zero-emissions cars, after years of frustration, we now have a chance to give Australians access to the world’s best transport technology”.</p> <p>At 2% of national passenger car sales, Australia lags behind most other developed countries on EV sales, with New Zealand already up to 10%, that country’s transport minister told the summit.</p> <p>But all is not lost.

It tells the story of a 12-year-old girl named Blaze who witnesses the rape and murder of a woman.</p> <p>“I had done decades of therapy, and I felt ready to tell the story,” says Barton, 49, seated in her studio in Paddington in inner Sydney.</p> <p>“But, no, I was totally unprepared for the degree to which it would re-trigger me, and I’ve had some really, really hard moments, and I want to be honest about that,” she says. “I went in feeling so resilient, and I’m back in therapy … I’m in a very supportive place, so I feel very blessed, but no – it’s been really, really hard, and I don’t say that lightly.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMMxLCQkOHs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KMMxLCQkOHs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Blaze, which opens this month, is a hybrid of naturalistic drama and fantasy sequences, which deploys elaborate costumes and stop-motion animation.

She wanted to meet Barton anyway, and recalls: “I was in big trouble because she was just so brilliantly fascinating and warm and interesting and captivating.” She accepted, and told Barton she wanted to make sure she could mentor whoever played Blaze, given the “pitfalls” that exist for young actors in the industry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/20/blaze-review-del-kathryn-bartons-feature-film-debut-will-take-your-breath-away\">Blaze review – Del Kathryn Barton’s feature film debut will take your breath away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stone was “incredible”, Barton says. “She really wanted me to know – and it was a huge gift – that she’d never suffered any kind of [physical] sexual violence, and that she really wanted to bring herself as a conduit for other women’s stories. That was very meaningful to her.”</p> <p>In 2018, Stone alleged that Geoffrey Rush engaged in inappropriate behaviour when the pair were acting in a 2010 production of The Diary of a Madman – claims which he denies. “I can’t deny that’s part of my story, my public story,” she says now, praising the women who have led the #MeToo conversation in Australia.</p> <p>“Certainly people very close to me have experienced sexual abuse and sexual violence. There are many doors to the house, and for some people it’s about policy work and it’s about reform, and for Del it’s through her art – and obviously the film is this beautiful testament to healing through creativity.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4aa60724fa0c35675416b95d3e68863bec6fcc58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aa60724fa0c35675416b95d3e68863bec6fcc58/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Savage in Blaze.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A fierce little lady’: Julia Savage in Blaze.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tanja Bruckner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barton describes Savage as a “fierce little lady”, who “identified as a feminist from the age of five”. She clinched the audition by performing a “rage dance”, which is seen towards the end of the film – and which the director believes connects audiences to the “emotional and physical experience” of trauma.</p> <p>Through the film the character of Blaze finds comfort in a large, benevolent dragon called Zephyr, represented in a four-metre-high costume designed by Barton as a nostalgic nod to her own childhood and “that beautiful idea that, as we transition into adulthood, we don’t let our inner dragons crawl into their caves and cease their fearless roar”.</p> <p>So is Blaze’s story also Del Kathryn Barton’s story, or is that too literal a reading? “It’s a little bit of both,” says Barton.</p> <p>“Definitely I never want to say that the film is autobiographical, but it is informed by personal experience.”</p> <p>When Barton was young, her parents Wesley and Karen moved their three children to an Angora goat farm by the Hawkesbury River, where they lived in a large circus-like tent for a couple of years while Wesley fixed up an old farmhouse. “We moved to the country as a response to what happened [to me] in the suburbs. That was my dad’s way of coping.”</p> <p>Now the film is finished, Barton is undecided whether she will show it to her “eccentric” father, who is unwell. “I almost want to protect him from that experience, I suppose,” she muses. When she speaks of her late mother, Karen, she apologises for looking behind me in the studio, “like there’s a ghost or something”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think rage as a motivator can be very powerful … but rage alone for me has been caustic</p> <footer> <cite>Yael Stone</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both her parents were teachers who were idealistic about education; Karen worked in a Steiner school and advised her daughter to be true to her passion for art. Barton – a two-time Archibald prizewinner who is now preparing for her first Los Angeles exhibition – believes imagination is crucial to healing.</p> <p>“I’m on meds now, and it’s a game-changer for me – I’m definitely not anti-establishment or anti-psychiatry,” she says. “[But] we live in … an overly anaesthetised society that teaches people to fear pain, to fear chaos and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">trauma body</a> – fuck, life’s hard man; life’s confusing – [rather than] sit in uncomfortable places and remain calm and find magic there.”</p> <p>Barton has long suffered social anxiety, which is at odds with her extroverted nature and her bellowing laugh.</p> <p>“I know, and I almost kick myself a bit, because I know I fake it really well,” she says. “But I do genuinely love people and I feel like, especially in a directing capacity, like, you really need to bring a certain energy to a room to carry people, but it takes a lot out of me.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2e31a65511a8649d9c04116dd2c406e283061ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e31a65511a8649d9c04116dd2c406e283061ec8/0_0_500_721/347.jpg\" alt=\"Del Kathryn Barton’s 2008 Archibald prize-winning painting: You are what is most beautiful about me, a self-portrait with Kell and Arella.\" width=\"347\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Del Kathryn Barton’s 2008 Archibald prizewinning painting, titled ‘You are what is most beautiful about me, a self-portrait with Kell and Arella’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Art Gallery of NSW</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barton is married to a “pathological, full-blown nerdy introvert”, a financial services executive she credits with helping her to understand herself. The couple have two children, a son and a daughter, who both featured in Barton’s 2008 Archibald prizewinning self-portrait.</p> <p>Barton sees female rage against the silencing of women as an important “generative” force.</p> <p>“For me there’s a difference between anger and rage,” Barton says. “[Rage is] when I’ve managed to do the cognitive work, identify more what’s happening in the emotional self … and through feeling it and expressing it on one level, I’m releasing it, so that it doesn’t cripple me.”</p> <p>She sees it as a collective energy too, with vast potential: “If it’s out in the open, and acknowledged as being a valid emotion, then I just think a lot of healing can happen at that point.”</p> <p>Yael Stone, who “totally validates Del’s experience”, has a different response: “For me, rage has been quite destructive in my life, even personal rage,” she says. “I think rage as a motivator can be very powerful … but rage alone for me has been caustic.” Being able to access her own rage is “an amazing gift” when so many women can’t – “but also a power to be wielded with a sense of responsibility”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be79824baf3096d512f831f4dd49a5608be4486a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be79824baf3096d512f831f4dd49a5608be4486a/0_0_5720_3813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Savage and Simon Baker in Blaze.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Savage and Simon Baker in Blaze.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Causeway films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Playing Blaze’s caring single father is Simon Baker, baffled about how he can help his daughter cope with what she has witnessed.

He wants to try a new challenge. We understand his decision. Yesterday [Thursday] I realised it was a real thing. My plans won’t change.

Real Madrid would like to express its gratitude and appreciation to Casemiro, who is part of the club’s history.”</p> \n<p>While the fee also includes a further €10m in add-ons, Casemiro’s medical and visa should be addressed this weekend though the latter may take a few days as was the case for Lisandro Martínez and Christian Eriksen, two of Ten Hag’s other additions.</p> \n<p> Casemiro should immediately improve United’s midfield. Ten Hag has only Fred and Scott McTominay as regular, frontline players in the department. Casemiro will bring a proven winning mentality, having claimed five Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles with Madrid since joining the Spanish club from São Paulo in 2013.</p> \n<p>Ten Hag also wants to sign Antony, the Ajax forward. While the Dutch club are reluctant to sell, the Guardian understands the 22-year-old is disappointed with Ajax’s stance and is hopeful a transfer to United can still occur. To do so a fee of £80m or more may be required for the Brazilian to be added to another area of the squad Ten Hag wishes to strengthen.</p> \n<p>Another Netherlands-based player, the PSV winger Cody

can","byline":"Barney Ronay at Lord's","body":"<p>Welcome back, then, the England Test team. We’ve been expecting you. On a weirdly frictionless third day at Lord’s England’s cricketers simply ran out of Baz. Or rather, they met a much stronger opponent in South Africa, with a bowling attack good enough to strip away the buzzwords, the marketing schlock, the vibes power, the man-feelings, to bury the adrenal highs of the early summer. And to do so with a surgical brilliance that feels all the more peculiar because it doesn’t really lead anywhere.</p> <p>South Africa didn’t look like a team that is about to give up playing Tests with any serious intent in the next four-year cycle. England didn’t look like the last guardians of the old form, more like a peculiar miscellany of the under-baked and the superannuated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/england-south-africa-first-test-day-three-match-report-cricket\">Sorry England slump to innings defeat inside three days against South Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet as ever there were notes of fascination, even on a day when England were rattled out in 37 overs to lose by an innings. There was a kind of poetry of decay in watching a 36-year-old Stuart Broad bat for England on this death rattle of a day, in the dead heat of a dying Test in a dying format, against opponents who will be back here again one day, just not any day soon.</p> <p>Has there been a more entertaining lower-order batsman in England’s Test history? Not many, and none that spring to mind. Broad came to the wicket at 86 for six. There is a kind of ceremonial feel to his arrival on occasions such as these, like sending out the liveried trumpeter with his scroll, here to announce that the end is nigh upon us.</p> <p>Broad is that rare thing, a cricketer with a batsman’s eye and a bowler’s heart. It really shouldn’t work. It is eight years now since that horrible blow under the grille against India that left him genuinely spooked by fast bowling, a state of affairs that makes every Test innings since an act of courage.</p> <p>Part of the joy of watching him is the look of dignified affront as he takes guard. He’s too tall for this. He radiates impermanence. But he can still play shots that are dreamy, balletic, physically creative, and beyond the reach of many top-order players. Here he was off like a shot, backing away from Anrich Nortje ,whirling and swiping wildly to leg, like a man trapped inside a revolving door trying desperately to free his umbrella from his belt hooks.</p> <p>Later in the over he hooked Nortje into the grandstand for six. The ball was bowled at 91mph. Broad looked away, flinched, clicked his ankles together, swung low to high and hit it into Hertfordshire. The next ball was scoop-driven from somewhere close to square leg. Nortje bounced him, but you can’t really bounce Broad: he’s not there, he’s the Scarlet Pimpernel, off whirling his cloak, examining the grass beyond the cut strip.</p> <p>Broad against high-pace bowling: this is the fourth format the ECB should have tried to patent and sell to the world. A bit later Marco Jansen got one up at his chin but was edged for another four, Broad clutching his bat to his throat, like a man playing the violin. The 50 partnership with Ben Stokes came up off 40 balls and the Lord’s crowd erupted into warm, fond applause, sucking the last sweetness out of the day.</p> <p>And really, enjoy this thing while you can. The future tours programme has already been pored and sighed over. The main takeaway is that England, Australia and India are playing each other every five months. Whereas between the current summer and December 2026, England and South Africa will play just five ODIs and three T20s. The next Test between these two is four and a half years away, with no date in the diary for a return to Lord’s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/19/zak-crawley-opening-batsman-drop-case-england-cricket\">Zak Crawley’s low scores make his case for being dropped all too clear | Andy Bull </a> </p> </aside>  <p>If there is another note of frustration here, it is simply the fact that South Africa have the best Test bowling attack in world cricket. Every one of their bowlers was better, and indeed consistently quicker, than every one of England’s bowlers. Lungi Ngidi takes his wickets at 20. Kagiso Rabada is a genuine hall-of-famer. And Rabada was smart enough to bowl a slower ball to Broad in his first over back, drawing a plinked drive to mid-off.</p> <p>Broad walked off with 35 off 29 balls, England’s second-highest run-scorer in this Test. But then he also has more career Test runs than Cyril Washbrook and is about to go past Patsy Hendren. Not to mention fifth spot on the all-time England six-hitting roster, a list that reads Stokes, Flintoff, Pietersen, Botham, Broad.</p> <p>Jansen did for Matthew Potts with a lovely in-ducker that met no resistance, no recognisable batting, then did for Jimmy Anderson with the same ball to wrap up the Test. The immediate feeling was mild embarrassment that England had been quite this brittle, dismissed twice in a rollicking 82.4 overs.</p> <p>And they are a weird all-sorts kind of team. Six players are over 30. Worse, these are also the good ones. England’s quickest bowler was their oldest bowler, their slowest their youngest.</p> <p>Things can change very quickly in a series in England. There will be new names at Old Trafford, perhaps even some new top-order players to replace the ones averaging 25, 26 and 29. England are good enough to test South Africa’s top order. But this felt like a strange kind of ending, illuminated only by the late bloom of Broad.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/20/jacinda-arderns-iron-grip-on-new-zealands-labour-party-is-slipping-and-that-means-trouble","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T19:00:18Z","webTitle":"Jacinda Ardern’s iron grip on New Zealand’s Labour party is slipping … and that means trouble","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/jacinda-arderns-iron-grip-on-new-zealands-labour-party-is-slipping-and-that-means-trouble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/20/jacinda-arderns-iron-grip-on-new-zealands-labour-party-is-slipping-and-that-means-trouble","fields":{"headline":"Jacinda Ardern’s iron grip on New Zealand’s Labour party is slipping … and that means trouble","trailText":"The prime minister imposed peace on a party once riven by public bickering, but a rogue MP has threatened all of that","byline":"Henry Cooke","body":"<p>Just hours after electing Jacinda Ardern leader in 2017, an extremely bruised Labour caucus stood onstage trying to assure media the party was united enough to govern.</p> <p>The party had cycled through four leaders since Helen Clark had last led them to government in 2008. It was riven with factionalism, leaks, and the detritus of huge egos stabbing each other in the back. It had now elected a fifth opposition leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/01/andrew-little-resigns-as-new-zealand-opposition-leader-weeks-from-election\">just six weeks out from the election</a>.</p> <p>Senior Labour MP Stuart Nash had said the day before that changing leaders at this point would be a disaster that would see Labour “implode”. (We’ll never really know if this was just an innocent mistake or a calculated shot at the forces who were that day working to install Ardern.)</p> <p>On that stage, Nash was asked whether he stood by the view – but before he could speak, Ardern stepped in to answer for him, saying he had “already acknowledged to me that he was wrong”.</p> <p>This was our first glimpse of Ardern’s new Labour party, one where any suggestion of disunity could be immediately batted away by a one-liner delivered through a smile. In the years that followed, Labour enjoyed an incredible streak of unity, with anything that Ardern said publicly treated as gospel by her MPs, even when she was making <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/112010254/government-to-make-statement-on-capital-gains-tax\">huge policy climbdowns</a> or <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300117812/election-2020-if-jacinda-ardern-supports-cannabis-legalisation-she-should-say-so\">refusing to use her power to further progressive causes</a>.</p> <p>Political journalists, myself included, had to make do on scraps such as a radio comment from a new MP that slightly differed from the party line, or tiny “leaks” from the Māori caucus that revealed little.</p> <p>This year that strong facade of unity is cracking. Now there is a feast.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/outgoing-labour-mp-louisa-wall-says-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-did-not-want-her-in-cabinet-or-caucus/IZ73L3YYEVFVUYWPTU7IVEUY5Q/\">First out of the gates was Louisa Wall</a>, a veteran MP who had been frozen out by Ardern and deselected from a safe seat in the 2020 election in a deft bit of political manoeuvring that never really made headlines. Wall had been on the opposite side of Ardern in factional disputes during the bad years, but by most insider accounts her greater sin was just not being much of a team player.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those MPs facing political oblivion will be looking for ways to make their mark</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wall let rip in her <a href=\"https://www.parliament.nz/mi/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/combined/HansDeb_20220414_20220414_44\">valedictory speech</a> and a series of long interviews on her way out, accusing the party of acting in a “corrupt” and “reprehensible” way.</p> <p>But these fireworks would pale in comparison to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/new-zealand-labour-mp-suspended-for-breaching-sense-of-trust-says-ardern\">saga that has unfolded in the last week</a> at the hands of backbench MP Gaurav Sharma.</p> <p>Sharma, elected in the huge red tide of 2020, was not a recognisable name before this episode. The whole thing reportedly started when Sharma was told he would not be allowed to hire any new staff, thanks to complaints from the staff that he had. Sharma wrote a vague column in the NZ Herald<em> </em>accusing the party of “rampant bullying” – and soon went to Facebook to make a more concrete list of allegations, including one about “misuse of taxpayer funds” that was swiftly batted away as incorrect by Parliamentary Service.</p> <p>Labour moved swiftly to suspend Sharma from its caucus, but in doing so gave him more ammunition. On Friday he completed an extraordinary media round of interviews accusing Ardern of “lying” over the nature of his exit, talking up a secret 55-minute tape of a conversation he had with a senior Labour MP about the terms of his exit, and saying there was far more discontent in the party but that a culture of fear would stop others from speaking out. He’s not so much airing Labour’s dirty laundry as plastering it to a plane and flying it around the country.</p> <p>Sharma himself is not an existential threat to Ardern’s hegemony over Labour. Any allies he had in caucus would have shrunk away the moment they realised he might secretly tape their conversation, or release screenshots in which they said they didn’t feel like going to work. His disagreement with the party is not ideological but personal, and his wider list of allegations of wrongdoing largely includes normal political processes, such as media training that instructs new MPs to keep their mouths shut and internal party business out of the public domain. Some news stories are already referring to Sharma as an “embattled” MP – never a good sign for career longevity.</p> <p>Yet Sharma and Wall before him will not be the only Labour MPs disgruntled with Ardern’s absolute rule over the party. Labour won so big in 2020 that even if it retains government at the 2023 election it will be losing at least a dozen MPs (including Sharma). Those MPs facing political oblivion will be looking for ways to make their mark and maybe secure a higher list placing, or at least a media gig after politics. Some of them might have actual ideological differences with Ardern and the ability to articulate them well. Others probably should have never been elected MPs at all, and wouldn’t have been had the party not wildly outperformed its expectations.</p> <p>Now, New Zealand politics could use a little more ill-discipline. In many countries a backbench MP criticising his or her own party happens regularly and is a sign of normal democracy. New Zealand’s parties expect far more rigorous discipline, with every MP expected to support their party on every single vote in parliament, save for the most contentious social issues.</p> <p>This is a factor of very small parties and a proportional electoral system. If you are elected not in a geographic constituency but from a party “list”, as 40% of our current MPs are, then it becomes harder to argue that you don’t owe that party your discipline. Proportional representation has also led to MPs who are sick of their own parties just resigning to start their own, instead of sticking around to sow discord from within.</p> <p>But this kind of wholesale change to our political culture will not happen overnight, and it will hopefully come from MPs with vision, rather than axes to grind. For now, Ardern faces a crisis that shows no sign of going away soon.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/19/revealed-liz-truss-supported-cuts-to-nhs-and-doctors-pay-in-thinktank-report","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T18:57:02Z","webTitle":"Revealed: Liz Truss personally supported cuts to NHS and doctors’ pay ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/19/revealed-liz-truss-supported-cuts-to-nhs-and-doctors-pay-in-thinktank-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/19/revealed-liz-truss-supported-cuts-to-nhs-and-doctors-pay-in-thinktank-report","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: Liz Truss personally supported cuts to NHS and doctors’ pay ","trailText":"Article by Tory hopeful arguing NHS ‘cannot be put on pedestal’ shows she fully backed 2009 cost-cutting pamphlet","byline":"Rowena Mason Deputy political editor","body":"<p>Liz Truss personally supported cuts to the NHS, arguing the service “cannot be put on a pedestal” in an article in which she also criticised the “inexorable” rise in doctors’ pay.</p> <p>The newly emerged opinion piece was written by Truss to support a thinktank report she co-authored that called for patients to be charged for GP appointments and doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10%.</p> <p>When details of this radical paper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/18/liz-truss-called-for-patients-to-be-charged-for-gp-visits-2009-document-reveals\">surfaced on Thursday</a>, Truss’s campaign insisted that “co-authoring a document does not mean that someone supports every proposal put forward”.</p> <p>However, the emergence of the accompanying article is likely to embarrass the Tory leadership frontrunner, showing she was actually fully supportive of the ideas set out in the 2009 report, which was called Back to Black.</p> <p>Labour said Truss “can’t be trusted to protect an NHS she doesn’t believe in or doctors she doesn’t value” after the appearance of her views when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, the year before she became an MP.</p> <p>In the Spectator article, Truss said the NHS cannot be a “no go area” when it comes to stripping out costs, adding that doctors’ pay had “risen inexorably” and “needs to be restrained”.</p> <p>She wrote: “In our new report <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/documents/Back%20to%20Black%20FINAL.pdf\">‘Back to Black</a>’, Reform argues that politicians will have to go beyond waste to achieve necessary reductions; tackling programmes and entitlements in the major spending areas to achieve change. We have identified £30bn cuts across the ‘big five’; defence, health, work &amp; pensions, communities and education.</p> <p>“No department can be a no go area. This means the NHS, accounting for a sixth of government expenditure, cannot be put on a pedestal. Doctors’ pay which has risen inexorably needs to be restrained. Superfluous bodies such as Strategic Health Authorities, and health campaigns exhorting the public to stop ‘vegging out’, should be abandoned.”</p> <p>She also called for reductions to “pension gimmicks for the well-off” – the universal winter fuel payment of more than £250 for older people, which still exists, and free television licences for over-75s, which are now funded only for those on pension credit.</p> <p>Although David Cameron went on to bring in swingeing cuts to the state during the austerity years, his slogan was “cut the deficit, not the NHS”. During his election campaigns, he promised to ringfence health spending because openly cutting it would be so controversial with the public, although NHS spending did end up being squeezed as well because it was not keeping pace with demand.</p> <p>Truss worked for Reform in 2008-09 before she became a Tory MP. In the Back to Black: Budget 2009 paper, the Tory and her co-authors also called for a review of the Trident nuclear deterrent.</p> <p>“The future of Trident should also be considered,” they wrote, on account of its £15-£20bn price tag. Truss recently committed to renewing Trident at a hustings in Scotland.</p> <p>The report also called for the abolition of universal child benefit, and the axing of several major military procurement projects including the Royal Navy’s planned aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, which were described as “inappropriate defence projects”.</p> <p>It came days after the Guardian revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/leaked-audio-reveals-liz-truss-said-british-workers-needed-more-graft\">a leaked recording of Truss</a> saying that British workers needed “more graft” and suggesting they lacked the “skill and application” of foreign rivals.</p> <p>Asked about the article supporting the Back to Black paper written 13 years ago, a Truss campaign spokesperson said: “This is a nearly two-decade-old document written against the backdrop of Labour bankrupting the economy.</p> <p>“Liz is focused on her bold economic plan to boost growth, cut taxes and put money back into hardworking people’s pockets.”</p> <p>Polls have consistently put Truss as clear favourite to win the race for No 10, with polling expert Sir John Curtice saying he would be “extraordinarily surprised” if she does not take office.</p> <p>Labour said Truss’s report revealed that “the reality of her agenda is devastating cuts” and that her track record “shows her true colours”.</p> <p>Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, said: “No public service would be safe with Liz Truss in charge. She simply can’t be trusted to protect an NHS she doesn’t believe in or doctors she doesn’t value. The more people discover about Liz Truss, the more her true destructive agenda to slash frontline services and drag Britain backwards become clear.</p> <p>“Liz Truss is a fantasist, totally out of touch and out of step with the public.”</p> <p>Truss and her rival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a>, will take part in a hustings in Manchester on Friday evening, as the pair continue to crisscross the country to try to shore up the support of Tory members.</p> <p>In another attempt to reach out to party members, Sunak on Friday pledged he would “end the war on motorists”, including a possible clampdown on so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which use filters to aim to boost walking and cycling by stopping motor vehicles from using smaller residential streets as rat runs.</p> <p>Sunak said there were concerns that LTNs, which are strongly backed by Johnson’s No 10, could delay emergency services. Emergency services have said they support the idea of LTNs. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/19/government-control-liverpool-city-council-report","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T18:53:47Z","webTitle":"Government to take greater control of Liverpool city council ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/government-control-liverpool-city-council-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/government-control-liverpool-city-council-report","fields":{"headline":"Government to take greater control of Liverpool city council ","trailText":"Intervention expanded to include financial decisions and governance after report calls for urgent reform","byline":"Nadeem Badshah and agency","body":"<p>The government’s intervention in the running of Liverpool city council is to be expanded to include governance and financial decision-making.</p> <p>It comes after the publication of another critical report on the local authority by four commissioners appointed last year to work with the council staff in key areas after an inspection.<br></p> <p>The report, published on Friday and addressed to the communities secretary, Greg Clark, said certain services were “failing” and in need of “urgent reform”.<br></p> <p>It warns that poor performance in procurement, finance and auditing are limiting the “council’s ability to operate at a crucial time” and called for an added role of “finance commissioner”.</p> <p>It comes after a report in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-61830195\">June revealed that Liverpool city council’s failure to renew contracts</a> across a number of services could cost it millions.</p> <p>Clark, in a letter to the commissioners, raises concerns about the financial situation facing the council. “I agree with your assessment that the council continues to fail in its best value duty and, therefore, I am minded to expand the intervention.”</p> <p>But the government intervention has been questioned by the Liverpool city mayor, Joanne Anderson, who tweeted: “Further government intervention will not solve the issues facing Liverpool city council – these are common issues being experienced right across local government.</p> <p>“Therefore, I accept the problems, but I question the solution.”</p> <p>While she thanked the commissioners, as well as the secretary of state, she said: “While I recognise that there are gaps in our workforce capacity and capability, this is not unique to Liverpool.</p> <p>“The UK is facing stark skills shortages, and it [is] widely known that local councils are struggling to improve capacity in key areas, which is making us dependent on interim staff that cost more in the short term.”</p> <p>One key reform is expected to be the creation of a Liverpool strategic futures advisory panel, chaired by the mayor of Liverpool city region, Steve Rotheram, and including Judith Blake, the former leader of Leeds city council, as well as Sir Howard Bernstein, the former chief executive of Manchester city council.</p> <p>Rotheram denied any suggestions that the panel had been created to run the council.

However, officials cautioned that the Chinese leader’s plans could change and it was possible that he could just attend virtually. Xi has not left China since January 2020.</p> <p>The SCO did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. The Russian state-owned news agency, Tass, reported in June that Putin was planning to attend the SCO summit.</p> <p>Xi and Putin are also expected to be at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/xi-and-putin-will-come-to-g20-says-indonesian-presidents-adviser\">G20 summit in Bali in November</a>, a meeting in which the US president, Joe Biden, is due to take part. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he would participate remotely.</p> <p>The Samarkand and Bali summits will provide an opportunity for critical face-to-face discussions at a time of extremely high tension, particularly over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s aggressive military posturing around Taiwan. The People’s Liberation Army carried out unprecedented military exercises around the island after a visit by the US house speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in early August.</p> <p>Beijing has supported Moscow rhetorically over Ukraine, refusing to criticise the invasion, but there is no evidence it has supplied weapons, as some US officials had feared. The last time they met, in Beijing in February, Putin and Xi vowed that the bilateral relationship would have “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/xi-jinping-meets-vladimir-putin-china-russia-tensions-grow-west\">no limits</a>”.</p> <p>The Russian military debacle in Ukraine is reported to have affected Chinese military thinking over Taiwan in ways that are still unclear. Russia’s problems have served as a reminder that China does not have everything in place yet necessary for an invasion, and that to invade without full preparation could be costly.</p> <p>On the other hand, the longer China puts off an attempt to reintegrate the island by force, the greater Taiwan’s opportunity to arm itself and learn from Ukraine’s success in keeping Russian forces at bay.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/19/brawn-review-kings-head-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"Brawn review – a half-formed play about toxic male self-image","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/19/brawn-review-kings-head-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/19/brawn-review-kings-head-theatre-london","fields":{"headline":"Brawn review – a half-formed play about toxic male self-image","trailText":"Christopher Wollaton impresses in a one-man show about body dysmorphia but his script suffers from a lack of proper plot","byline":"Arifa Akbar","body":"<p>“What we are showing here is important,” says Christopher Wollaton at the end of this 50-minute play about male body dysmorphia, obsessive exercise and disordered eating.

He talks to us about his life – the plan to study physics that went wrong, the girl he fancied at school who fell for a brawnier guy and taunts for being “lanky”. All of which has led him here, fixating on his muscle mass and gunning for a physical perfection that makes up for the unfulfilled dreams, or so he tells himself.</p> <p>Directed by Elliot Taylor, Wollaton has a vulnerable intensity on stage, shirtless for the most part and breaking off for bursts of physical exercise. But despite his very compelling performance, the show feels beached by its lack of plot. It is a character study whose drama rests on backstory, exposition and a narrative that is little more than the ghosting of a girlfriend.</p> <p>The production is frustrating and promising in equal measure: the script is well written, with the potential to build towards a much more dynamic play. There are powerful moments when Ryan stands in front of an invisible mirror and speaks in affirmations that come to seethe with desperation and hollowness: “I <em>am</em> handsome”, “You’ve got this”. But it all feels like a good, strong background study for a play rather than the play itself.</p> <p>But it is refreshing to see the subject dramatised with such passion. The poet Andrew McMillan has explored similar ground with delicacy and lyricism in poems such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SAVLsLjBAU\">The Men Are Weeping in the Gym</a>. Ryan seems preoccupied by power, channelled through the aesthetics of his muscle-bound form. Women like men who are physically strong, he tells himself,<strong> </strong>though we get the sense that he is competing with, and proving himself to, the men around him. It is a wounded and obsessive picture of young heterosexual manhood and we <em>do</em> walk away feeling this is an important show, albeit in chrysalis.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://kingsheadtheatre.com/whats-on/brawn\">King’s Head theatre</a>, London, until 3 September.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"UN urges Moscow not to take nuclear power plant off grid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","fields":{"headline":"UN urges Moscow not to take nuclear power plant off grid – as it happened","trailText":"Secretary general makes plea amid concerns from western officials over whether cooling of reactor can be maintained","byline":"Sarah Haque, Gemma McSherry and Samantha Lock","body":"<div id=\"block-62ffc1548f081780606cba46\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-19T18:00:06.780Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary of today's developments</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It is 9pm in Ukraine. Here are some things you might’ve missed:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Putin has agreed for inspectors to visit Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. </strong>According to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, Putin had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN secretary-general has asked Russia not take Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. </strong>António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”. <br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Western officials say that there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at Russian-held nuclear power plant. </strong>The existing reactor cooling system at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation – but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. </strong>Western officials have said that the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall “combat stasis” remains.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine,</strong> including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest.</strong> Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites - including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined U.S.-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles (£28,635) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles (£158,291) for violating military censorship laws.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv. </strong>It is the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. </strong>Hit by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p>The Kyiv Independent reported that <strong>rescuers are searching for people and bodies </strong>under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. </strong>“Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he told the news agency. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.<strong><br></strong></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. </strong>Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That is all for today.

But they added that there were back-up diesel generators to maintain electricity supply and a Ukrainian workforce at the site “able to operate and mitigate against this”.</p> \n  <p>A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost after an earthquake and a tsunami overwhelmed the back-up generators on site. The loss of cooling was enough to lead to a partial reactor meltdown.</p> \n  <p>The western official said that fighting around the plant was considered a far lesser risk because nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impacts with thick walling. “They are built to be able to cope with a civilian airline crashing into them,” the official said, and added that “direct fires” such as artillery was “not our immediate concern”.</p> \n  <p>But they would not comment on whether they believed Russia was deliberately staging forces at the site, or was preparing a false flag operation, other than to note that “both sides are contesting the information environment”. Social media videos appeare to show Russian forces basing themselves on the site.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8502cc3ed5e6daef5a75ae156cc612bdb4f3b219\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8502cc3ed5e6daef5a75ae156cc612bdb4f3b219/0_138_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A serviceman with a Russian flag stands guard near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant outside the Russian-controlled city of Enerhodar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A serviceman with a Russian flag stands guard near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant outside the Russian-controlled city of Enerhodar.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-19T13:14:23.113Z\">at 2.14pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ff86298f0828049565c896\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-19T12:54:08.950Z\">1.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Crazy things are happening': life in occupied Ukrainian nuclear city</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Olexander, a former worker at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station wrote an account of living in Enerhodar, a satellite city for the plant, for the Guardian.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I dedicated my life to nuclear power and have always been proud to be part of it.

And the strike meant everyone had hiked in and arrived red and glistening. There was a lot of talk about what the morning would bring, and given the conditions, an expectation the ball would swing. England had a new one due, too, three overs the start of play, and, as always, the two of the very best men to use it. The odd thing was that they ended up standing in the outfield while Matt Potts and Ben Stokes did the bowling. It was all part of Ben Stokes’s grand plan to bounce out the tail. Like Lance Corporal Jones, he is absolutely convinced they don’t like it up ’em.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/aug/19/england-v-south-africa-first-test-day-three-live-score-updates-cricket\">England v South Africa: first Test, day three – live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So his bowling went like this: short, short, full, a grimace, a sigh, a smile, and short, short, full. The next over was the same, short, full, full, short, short, full, short, and the one after that too. Anrich Nortje played it all with the confidence of a man who bowls at 95mph himself. He rode some, wore others, slapped at a couple, swayed away from the rest. He was wearing an outsize chest guard which made it look like he’d stuffed a pillow up his vest, and he and Stokes joked about it at the end of the over. Then when Broad replaced Potts at the Nursery End, it was more of the same, short, short, full, short, full, full.</p> <p>After nine overs of this, Nortje had made it to 20 and Marco Jansen was closing in on his 50. It was roundabout then that someone in the crowd snapped and shouted out “pitch the ball up”. Soon after Broad did exactly that and got Jansen out caught at slip. He did the same thing to dismiss Lungi Ngidi in his very next over. By then, Stokes had flogged himself through six overs of short stuff for 18 runs, and won exactly nothing for it. It was like watching a man handing over fistfuls of change to have another go throwing at coconuts because he hasn’t realised that they’ve all been nailed to the shy.</p> <p>All of which will end up a footnote in the story this Test, way down the bottom of the long list of things England got wrong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/england-south-africa-first-test-day-three-match-report-cricket\" title=\"\">in the two-and-a-half days’ play</a>. But it still felt worth telling, because it was such a revealing little detail. Stokes had a clear idea about the way he wanted to play and wasn’t going to move away from it whatever anyone else had to say. He is dogmatic that way. As a captain, he has all the flexibility of a brick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"101ca57af6f5570edd97d76363e5615165317870\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/101ca57af6f5570edd97d76363e5615165317870/0_0_4639_2784/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zak Crawley is dismissed by Keshav Maharaj for 13.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zak Crawley is dismissed by Keshav Maharaj for 13.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This approach has its advantages, it’s just that very few of them were apparent in this match, when England seemed to be wedded to all sorts of odd ideas, like keeping in five slips, and opening the batting with Zak Crawley.</p> <p>At this point, you don’t really need to make the argument for dropping Crawley, he’s doing it all by himself. His average is 20 in all forms of cricket this year, with a top score of 84 against Northamptonshire back in May. In Test matches the figure’s down to 16. Right now, there are only two men in the history of the game who have opened the batting as often as he has, and done so poorly at it, Alick Bannerman, who played his last game 127 years ago, and, Javed Omar, who propped up Bangladesh in the years after they first started playing Test cricket.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/ben-stokes-praises-relentless-south-africa-but-refuses-to-panic-after-defeat\">Ben Stokes praises ‘relentless’ South Africa but refuses to panic after defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here at Lord’s, Crawley batted like a man who was almost entirely unfamiliar with the act. It was like a living anxiety dream in which he’d rushed out to bat then looked down and found he brought an umbrella with him. He got out here, plumb LBW, throwing a sweep at a full straight delivery from Keshav Maharaj which he didn’t even come close to hitting. As Mark Butcher said while he was watching it on TV, it almost feels cruel that they keep on picking him. The sensible thing to do would be to let him go back to first class cricket (if only there was some scheduled for him to play in) and work on his game. After all, he is young enough to come again.</p> <p>But Stokes doesn’t want to do it, because he believes it would be a backward step for the team. He wants everyone to know that they will get a run of games, even when they fail. So Crawley is living off the hope that someday soon everything will click for him again, and he will play one of those innings of his that reminds everyone what England saw in him when they picked him to begin with, like his 257 against Pakistan, his 77 against Australia, or his 121 against the West Indies. There was a little glimmer of it against India in the last Test, when his drive finally started working for him and he made 46.</p> <p>Which is the innings assistant coach Paul Collingwood brought up when he was defending the selection before the match. “We don’t necessarily look for consistency with Zak,” Collingwood said, “it’s about being able to do special things.” Unfortunately, consistency is exactly what he’s giving them. He’s made six single figure scores in 10 innings. At this point the case for dropping seems as obvious to everyone watching as, well, asking Anderson to use the new ball in the morning.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/19/ben-stokes-praises-relentless-south-africa-but-refuses-to-panic-after-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T17:56:35Z","webTitle":"Ben Stokes praises ‘relentless’ South Africa but refuses to panic after defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/ben-stokes-praises-relentless-south-africa-but-refuses-to-panic-after-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/19/ben-stokes-praises-relentless-south-africa-but-refuses-to-panic-after-defeat","fields":{"headline":"Ben Stokes praises ‘relentless’ South Africa but refuses to panic after defeat","trailText":"The England captain admitted that his side were ‘just outperformed’ in the innings and 12 runs defeat inside three days in the first Test at Lord’s","byline":"Simon Burnton at Lord's","body":"<p>Ben Stokes promised he was “not going to throw my toys out of the pram” after the resurgence of England’s Test side under his leadership was emphatically derailed by South Africa at Lord’s.</p> \n<p>After England slumped to defeat inside three days – the first of which was mostly lost to rain – by an innings and 12 runs their coach, Brendon McCullum, said some defeats were inevitable given the team’s aggressive gameplan.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/england-south-africa-first-test-day-three-match-report-cricket\">Sorry England slump to innings defeat inside three days against South Africa</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“As we said at the outset, you have to buckle up for the ride,” he said. “The four Tests that we won recently, we were behind the game in each of them and were able to get ourselves back in front and put the opposition under pressure, which allowed us to go on and win. In this game we weren’t quite able to do that and we went on to lose. It’s such fine margins. We’ll have a good look at things among the group and then recharge.”</p> \n<p>Stokes admitted his side had been comprehensively outplayed, but was optimistic that they could level the series at Old Trafford next week. “They were just relentless,” he said. “When you’re playing international sport, some days they’re going to be better than you. Over the three days, whenever they were batting or bowling, whatever we threw at them, they seemed to counteract that. It was an off game for us, and that’s absolutely fine. It’s not something I’m going to be throwing my toys out of the pram over. We’ll move on to the next Test, and go out there and try and win.”</p> \n<p>For many members of the England team this was a first competitive game since they beat India at Edgbaston at the start of July, but Stokes refused to blame the hiatus for their poor performance. “If you start looking at that, I would say you’re just looking at excuses,” he said. “Five weeks away for this group is obviously not ideal, but we’ve all been playing professional cricket for a number of years. We know how to play cricket. We don’t want to create an excuses-based culture. We look at it as South Africa just outperformed us.”</p> \n<p>After bowling South Africa out for 326 on the third morning England’s attempt to recover from a 161-run first-innings deficit looked forlorn once Keshav Maharaj dismissed Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope before lunch. Thereafter they crumbled before the pace and variety of South Africa’s seam attack. “Trent Boult and Tim Southee were [also] pretty relentless,” Stokes said of the key bowlers in the New Zealand team beaten 3-0 earlier in the summer. “We were just a lot better in that series than we were today. They weren’t any more relentless [than that], they were just better than us. We haven’t performed anywhere near what we can.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ca8b74cf09886767c478cc29f2caffc6719bdd3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ca8b74cf09886767c478cc29f2caffc6719bdd3/0_45_4217_2530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kagiso Rabada of South Africa celebrates after dismissing England captain Ben Stokes during day three of the Test match\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kagiso Rabada, who was named player of the match after taking seven wickets, celebrates the dismissal of Ben Stokes on day three.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/ECB/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This was Dean Elgar’s 12th game as South Africa’s Test captain, and the first in which he has won the toss and chosen to bowl first. After securing victory he admitted that despite the thick cloud and gloomy forecast of the opening day he was inclined to have a bat. “I like putting runs on the board first,” he said, “but sometimes you’ve got to go horses for courses and respect the conditions. Everything was saying bowl first.

He also told the Herald in Scotland that the squad were “very supportive” of Bryan Easson, the head coach, who was in charge during a match against Wales in the 2021 Six Nations, when Cattigan’s family allege she was urged to return to the field when suffering a significant brain injury. The SRU has said none of the medical team that day recall that happening and <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/sport/20640404.mark-dodson-doubles-position-inquiry-siobhan-cattigans-tragic-death/\" title=\"\">that Easson categorically denies making the demand</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/worcesters-premiership-future-under-threat-after-winding-up-petition\">Worcester’s Premiership future under threat after winding-up petition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Appearing to speak on behalf of the squad, Mitchell said: “We cannot and will not challenge what the Cattigans believe [but] what we can do is put forward our understanding of how this squad experience playing for Scotland, and the support they receive … the healthcare they receive is excellent, the pastoral care is excellent, and they [the squad] are upset at the inference that can be drawn that it was less than that.”</p> <p>However, within hours of the publication of Mitchell’s comments, more than 20 members of the Scotland squad, including the captain, Rachel Malcolm, had issued the same statement on Twitter. “We were unaware of this RPS article being published,” it read, “or the statements attributed to the team in this article. We are grieving our friend and teammate, our thoughts are with Siobhan’s family.”</p> <p>Mitchell has told the Guardian: “The RPS are comfortable with the integrity of the article. We are concerned to ensure we protect the interests of the players, and conversations are ongoing to that end.”</p> <p>Mitchell is keen to emphasise the RPS’s independence from the SRU. Formed in 2018, the last players collective to be established in a major union, the RPS is a rare example of such an organisation not funded, at least in part, by its governing body. As such he insists his comments have not been voiced through him by the union itself but are a true reflection of the players’ feelings.</p> <p>The blanket rejection of the article by so many of the squad seems to confound that idea. It also represents the latest escalation in criticism of the SRU’s handling of Cattigan before her death and of the events after it. The Cattigan family’s harrowing testimony to the Sunday Times last month alleged a series of missteps by the union and its employees.</p> <p>The SRU has faced a hailstorm of outrage over the allegations and the family are taking legal action.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/19/salman-rushdie-writers-new-york-read-works-solidarity","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T17:47:06Z","webTitle":"Salman Rushdie: writers gather in New York to read author’s works in solidarity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/19/salman-rushdie-writers-new-york-read-works-solidarity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/19/salman-rushdie-writers-new-york-read-works-solidarity","fields":{"headline":"Salman Rushdie: writers gather in New York to read author’s works in solidarity","trailText":"Event organized by Pen America champions freedom to write after novelist survived assassination attempt last week","byline":"Maya Yang in New York","body":"<p>Crowds gathered near the steps of the New York Public Library in midtown Manhattan on Friday morning, as writers read works by the novelist Salman Rushdie, who survived <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/salaman-rushdie-attack-was-unjustifiable-says-pakistans-imran-khan\">an assassination attempt</a> in western New York last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/salaman-rushdie-attack-was-unjustifiable-says-pakistans-imran-khan\">Salman Rushdie attack was unjustifiable, says Pakistan’s Imran Khan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The event, Stand With Salman; Defend the Freedom to Write, was organized by Pen America, the library and Rushdie’s publisher, Penguin Random House.</p> <p>Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution last Friday when he was attacked on stage and stabbed multiple times.</p> <p>Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old man from Fairview, New Jersey, was arrested.

Eugenides recalled how enamored he was by Rushdie’s works and wanted to meet him in person.</p> <p>“I looked him up in the London phone book. There it was, under the Rs – Rushdie, Salman, along with an address and a telephone number. I took the Tube out to his house.

While Kyiv has been coy in discussing the incidents publicly, dropping heavy hints but not explicitly taking credit, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/17/europe/crimea-explosions-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html\" title=\"\">unnamed officials</a> have been busy <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/briefing/russia-ukraine-war-partisans.html\" title=\"\">briefing reporters</a>. On 9 August, nine or more Russian warplanes appear to have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show\" title=\"\">destroyed at the Saky airbase</a> on the peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Then, on Tuesday, blasts were reported at an ammunition site and airfield. Russia <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62560041\" title=\"\">blamed “sabotage”</a>. On Thursday night, there were reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/fires-and-explosions-reported-at-military-targets-in-russia-and-crimea\" title=\"\">more explosions</a> at the major Belbek airbase, as well as a blaze at a munitions depot inside Russia.</p> <p>All these are a much-needed fillip for Ukrainian morale. A senior presidential adviser has said that there is “strategic deadlock”. Though the picture in the country’s south is muddled, Russian forces appear largely stalled. But Ukraine is massively outgunned and Russia continues to gain ground in the east, albeit slowly and with serious losses, by pounding away with heavy artillery and no regard for the cost to Ukrainian civilians or its own forces.</p> <p>Events in Crimea are a long way from turning the tide. Officials in Ukraine say that they hope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/creating-chaos-zelenskiys-adviser-outlines-ukraines-military-strategy\" title=\"\">hitting deep into occupied territory </a>will cut supply routes and erode Russian capabilities. The defence minister has said that it will ultimately <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/17/ukraine-defense-minister-special-forces-new-strategy/\" title=\"\">launch a full-scale counter-offensive</a>, when it has the weapons and ammunition that it needs from its partners. In other words, its more nimble approach is a matter of necessity as well as ability.</p> <p>Additionally, wars are only partially fought on the battlefield. Kyiv also needs to kindle renewed purpose at home and maintain national unity as the relief and pride at holding off the initial Russian onslaught inevitably fades, and grinding <a href=\"https://ukranews.com/en/news/877020-economy-ministry-predicts-drop-in-gdp-by-35-40-in-2022\" title=\"\">economic</a>, social and psychological pressures take their toll. It needs to rattle the confidence of Moscow – which this week replaced the commander of its Black Sea fleet – and lower the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/i-dont-see-justice-in-this-war-russian-soldier-exposes-rot-at-core-of-ukraine-invasion\" title=\"\">morale of Russian forces</a>. Russia felt safe in Crimea, with its tourists sunning themselves on the beaches. Now they have been filmed <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/crimea-traffic-jam-explosion-air-base-russia-ukraine-1732845\" title=\"\">fleeing</a> the sands, with plumes of black smoke visible in the distance.</p> <p>Finally, Kyiv needs a sense of fresh momentum to maintain support elsewhere. The story of a plucky, courageous underdog staving off a vicious invasion was enough to create a wave of public and political support across Europe this spring. As fuel prices keep rising and winter approaches, sympathy and solidarity will ebb, and politicians are likely to become correspondingly warier of extending their support to Ukraine and punishment of Russia.</p> <p>It has also been clear from the beginning of the conflict that a less confident Vladimir Putin may be more dangerous. On Thursday, Moscow snubbed the call from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, visiting Ukraine, for a withdrawal of military equipment and personnel from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. Russia seized the plant this spring and the two countries have accused each other of shelling the site. Ukraine has warned that Russia may plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant\" title=\"\">to stage a “provocation”</a> there or to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant\" title=\"\">stop generating electricity</a> – which could increase the risk of an accident. Mr Putin knows that the weaponisation of a nuclear plant would be crossing a new frontier. But brinkmanship is itself a danger, bearing the risks of unintended disaster. Whatever confidence Kyiv has gained from the damage in Crimea, it will not mistake events this week as offering respite.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-de-extinction-jurassic-park-may-be-becoming-reality","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T17:25:16Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on de-extinction: Jurassic Park may be becoming reality | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-de-extinction-jurassic-park-may-be-becoming-reality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/the-guardian-view-on-de-extinction-jurassic-park-may-be-becoming-reality","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on de-extinction: Jurassic Park may be becoming reality","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> We should be keeping endangered species alive rather than bringing animals back from extinction","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>The last official sighting of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/de-extinction-scientists-are-planning-the-multimillion-dollar-resurrection-of-the-tasmanian-tiger?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">Tasmanian tiger</a> in the wild occurred in 1930, when it was <a href=\"http://www.naturalworlds.org/thylacine/history/persecution/persecution_9.htm\" title=\"\">shot</a> by a farmer. The marsupials, formally known as thylacines, were hunted to extinction by European settlers who considered them a threat to their sheep and poultry. However, the 6ft-long creatures may reappear if a group of biotechnologists have their way.</p> <p>The company Colossal Biosciences, along with researchers from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/26/australia-thylacine-tasmanian-tiger-extinct/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter\" title=\"\">University of Melbourne</a>, plans to “de-extinct” the thylacine by using gene-editing technology. Australia has the fastest rate of mammal extinction in the world; disappearances are down to the arrival of foreign species and wildfires linked to the climate crisis. Scientists argue that in Tasmania the loss of the thylacine left the numbers of smaller marsupials unchecked, leading to over-grazing and threatening a fragile ecological balance.</p> <p>If it all sounds like a plot line from Jurassic Park, then that is because the science behind the resurrection plan provided the movie’s inspiration. Last year Colossal, co-founded by a Harvard geneticist, <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/world-news/north-america/paris-hilton-among-75m-donors-in-bid-to-recreate-the-woolly-mammoth-41429895.html\" title=\"\">raised $75m</a> – including cash from the billionaire <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-09/woolly-mammoth-revival-raises-75-million-from-vc-firms-paris-hilton?sref=Xl91GI8N\" title=\"\">producer</a> of the latest Jurassic Park movie – to help bring back a genetically engineered hybrid version of the woolly mammoth. The company makes a rather incredible claim that bringing back herds of these creatures to the northern tundra could <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/woolly-mammoths-walk-arctic-tundra-140000221.html\" title=\"\">reverse climate change</a> in the Arctic.</p> <p>The US-based firm takes a more <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/startup-colossal-biosciences-has-dubious-plan-to-resurrect-extinct-tasmanian-tiger?via=twitter_page\" title=\"\">conventional</a> approach in Tasmania. Over the coming decade, it plans to use gene editing to turn the cell of one of the thylacine’s closest native relatives – either a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/de-extinction-company-aims-to-resurrect-the-tasmanian-tiger/\" title=\"\">dunnart</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dna-from-tiny-marsupial-could-help-the-tasmanian-tiger-spring-back-to-life-7ngtdzbpj\" title=\"\">numbat</a> – into a thylacine cell. It would take these thylacine cells to create an embryo, either in a petri dish or the womb of a living animal. This embryo would then be implanted into a female marsupial that would, scientists hope, give birth to a “thylacine” baby.</p> <p>There are good reasons to be sceptical about such a plan, notably that the available thylacine genome is incomplete. Filling the gaps is a challenge. An attempt to recover the genome of the <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00249-4\" title=\"\">Christmas Island rat</a>, which became extinct more than 100 years ago, failed because nearly 5% of its DNA was impossible to fully recover. It is unclear how the Tasmanian tiger would deal with invasive species that have arrived since it became extinct.</p> <p>There are more general concerns about unintended consequences. Once human-made changes to genomes are made, natural selection will take over and could affect the modifications in unknown ways. What if modified genes are spread to wild relatives? Given that the investors will want a return, there are also questions about who will <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Antoinette-Piaggio/publication/310607128_Is_it_time_for_synthetic_biodiversity_conservation/links/5b7c3632299bf1d5a719df5d/Is-it-time-for-synthetic-biodiversity-conservation.pdf\" title=\"\">own</a> the endangered species modified by patented technologies – and who will be responsible for the consequences of their reintroduction.</p> <p>Science should focus not on reviving extinct species but on keeping endangered ones alive.

In May and June, my wife, our dog and I travelled in our motorhome over an eight-week period through France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria and Slovenia. I was expecting to see surprise smiles, smirks even, when we ventured to converse with locals. Strangely, such reactions didn’t occur. Pretty much everyone was polite and cheery towards us. </p> <p>The Germans and Slovenians seemed delighted to have us in their countries. The eight weeks passed with hardly a mention of Brexit, except when we initiated apologies ourselves. The most embarrassing time was when chatting to a couple from the US. The conversation flowed quite well, with us applying the typical Brit irony to our repartee. The conversation was killed, however, when Donald Trump was mentioned. So, all in all, Brexit was less embarrassing than Trumpism.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Mal Jones </strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Cardiff</em></p> <p>• Believe it or not, there are British people who are still at home in Europe and who speak European languages reasonably well, including many with second homes abroad. I happen to be one of them, with a house in Italy and bilingual grandchildren in France. I am not sure how much the depiction of supposed embarrassment among remainer holidaymakers is accurate. But those of us who are implacably opposed to Brexit should say so loud and clear at every opportunity. I get smiles from French border police for telling them that I wish I were in another queue.</p> <p>Of course, Zoe Williams is right about the low morale of remainers. Labour has a lot to answer for in its craven surrender to the supposed inevitability of Brexit. I experienced it during the referendum itself. Having worked for Labour in Thanet South, Kent, against two varieties of Ukip – Nigel Farage’s and the Tory candidate’s – I later moved to Deal and offered my services to the Dover constituency party to campaign for remain. No one called until a day after the vote, when I was told that it would not have helped. I have since moved to Scotland and vote SNP. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Michael Hollington</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire</em></p> <p>• I sympathise with Zoe Williams, but imagine being a British citizen who’s lived in the EU for decades. I moved to Finland in 1999 with my Finnish wife. After the referendum, I had to explain to bemused Finnish friends that I was as confused as they were. Then we had months of seeing the EU demand that its citizens in the UK be respected, while all the UK press seemed interested in was EU citizens in the UK. Then the worry about a no-deal Brexit. Would I go from being in work legally to being forbidden from working? Would my residency be rescinded in a split second? Without Finland passing emergency domestic legislation, both these things would be true. Brexit gave many of us three and a half years of hellish stress.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Alun Parsons</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Vantaa, Finland</em></p> <p>• Zoe Williams has nicely captured the sense of alienation generated by Brexit. I’m a Brit and have been living in Barcelona for 15 years. Initially, the reaction to Brexit in Spain was one of sadness or irritation, or both. Many Spaniards have the perception that the British are obsessed with being different and that it stems from a superiority complex. I identify with Zoe’s desire to be apologetic about Brexit.

In South Tyneside, we are passionate about supporting our own carers to enable our children to be cared for by them.

The Guardian has spoken to three fans of the original series about what they’re most looking forward to about the spin-off – and what they’re apprehensive about.</p> <p>Joe Brookes, a 28-year-old council worker from Stourbridge, has high hopes for the new series and thinks that although the first season may start slowly, it’s necessary to thoroughly develop the characters and plot.</p> <p>“I think it would be quite a slow burn, but in a good way, similar to the first season of Game of Thrones,” Brookes says. “I think it will be introducing us to the characters, and you’ll see some minor backstabbing, but I don’t really think it will get into the meat and potatoes of it. It would be good to see them start to explore the political themes which made the original programme so big.”</p> <p>But one of Brookes’s biggest fears is that they may rush the ending, which he feels happened in the original series.</p> <p>“This time, I hope that they’ll give the series a little more time to breathe, so we can get to know the characters more. My big worry is that they rush things and they don’t explore them enough in depth.”</p> <p>He adds: “I really hope it’s good enough, and it brings people back to what they liked about the original series in the first place, as it was unique in the sense of how big it was.”</p> <p>Despite being a big fan of Game of Thrones, having re-read the book series last year, Robert Terry, a 33-year-old systems engineer from West Yorkshire, says his initial hopes for the new series aren’t “sky high”.</p> <p>“The book [that House of the Dragon is based on] doesn’t have the same lasting impact on me as a reader or as a viewer that Games of Thrones does,” Terry says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b84054bd2d3a01de2adebe93346f93c95e6b113\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b84054bd2d3a01de2adebe93346f93c95e6b113/96_0_768_960/400.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Terry \" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Terry’s hopes are not ‘sky high’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian / Robert Terry</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Terry says that as the source material is more straightforward than that of the original series, this one may be more of a “spectacle” rather than being as intricately plotted as the original.</p> <p>“I just think with the amount of money they’ve pumped into it and the hype, they’re not going to be able to build it up slowly like they did with Game of Thrones,” Terry adds. “I hope I’m wrong, but I get the distinct impression that we’re not going to be waiting two seasons for a very expensive battle scene.”</p> <p>Anthony Flintshire, in his 50s, said he hoped House of the Dragon would have a well-structured storyline, something he felt the last series of Game of Thrones lacked once the plot deviated from the books.</p> <p>“I fear that the storytelling won’t be that cohesive. And if it isn’t, and you’re sitting there thinking that certain things couldn’t have logically happened at that time, that would be a big fear,” Flintshire says.</p> <p>“It’s so complex and character-driven that we need to be happy with the arc of those characters. But overall, I’m optimistic.”</p> <p>What Flintshire is looking forward to in the series is seeing Rhys Ifans, who plays Otto Hightower, as he says they went to secondary school together in Wales.</p> <p>“I did a few theatre productions with him at school, and he was always such a big character,” he says.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/19/marc-cucurella-chelsea-eibar-teammates","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T16:30:15Z","webTitle":"‘A player with no ego’: why Chelsea’s Marc Cucurella is so effective","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/marc-cucurella-chelsea-eibar-teammates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/19/marc-cucurella-chelsea-eibar-teammates","fields":{"headline":"‘A player with no ego’: why Chelsea’s Marc Cucurella is so effective","trailText":"Spaniard’s former sporting director at Eibar and teammates on the most expensive full-back in Premier League history","byline":"Sid Lowe","body":"<p>“He’s not quick, he’s not strong.

I called and he was keen, very clear that was his chance to play in the first division, to progress. It was all very quick.”</p> <p>Quick is the word: from no one interested, La Liga’s smallest club signing him on deadline day to Manchester City and Chelsea fighting over him in only four years, development measured in his increasing price every summer.</p> <p>In 2018 Cucurella, who had been at Barcelona since he joined the youth squad in 2012, went to Eibar on loan. In 2019 Eibar paid €2m to buy him only for Barcelona to buy him back for €4m 16 days later and loan him to Getafe. In 2020 Getafe paid the €10m option. And in 2021 Brighton paid £15.4m. This month Chelsea spent £62m, making him the most expensive full-back in Premier League history.</p> <p>“What he’s done is practically impossible,” says Rodri Tarín, now of Oviedo. “To go from an academy like Barcelona’s to clubs that are totally different, polar opposites, in consecutive summers and adapt is spectacular.</p> <p>“You never know how good a player is until he’s competing, and every time Cucu’s stepped up he has carried on at exactly the same level, with the same personality. Which is why it wouldn’t surprise if he plays well at Chelsea.”</p> <p>Tarín played alongside Cucurella in the Barcelona B defence. “Spontaneous, natural: a happy, relaxed guy who enjoys what he does and doesn’t worry excessively” in Tarín’s words, Cucurella made one first-team appearance in the cup but that lasted seven minutes and opportunities were limited.</p> <p>There might not have been many more at Eibar: José Ángel Valdés, “Cote”, was first-choice left-back. In truth Cucurella was signed as backup. “With Cucurella’s age and level, we liked what we’d seen in Barcelona’s feeder team and thought it worth a go,” Garagarza says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8aeced69c14634eadc4433642fcb20646239b2ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8aeced69c14634eadc4433642fcb20646239b2ca/0_0_2318_1545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cucurella playing for Eibar in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cucurella playing for Eibar in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We had identified him as a vertical, associative full-back who fits the manager’s high press although the formation and style was very different. He could get up and back, good in transition. He wasn’t a great crosser – more a good passer – but we had Cote who was, so didn’t mind. We signed him at the last minute, the season had started, the team was settled. We were OK with Cote; we needed another full- back with a different profile but [only] in case he got injured.” He did not but it did not matter.</p> <p>Cote recalls: “He came young and I had the advantage: I’d been there two years, the manager knew me, trusted me. I was used to his system, which was to arrive on the outside and cross. It was hard for Marc to get a chance at full-back. But he’s so clever, so sharp, that Mendi saw he could play in any position.”</p> <p>Garagarza remembers a discussion about Cucurella becoming a pivot but it was left midfield where he found a place. It began in Valladolid in week 12, only Cucurella’s second start, and it did not immediately go to plan, which speaks volumes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0544edaf93f46489c4cdc1d7ef12864e0bbfbfce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0544edaf93f46489c4cdc1d7ef12864e0bbfbfce/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brighton fans wear Marc Cucurella wigs outside Elland Road in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brighton fans wear Marc Cucurella wigs outside Elland Road in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We get to half-time and Mendi has a right go at him,” Cote says. “He tells him everything he’s done is wrong, that he doesn’t want him so deep, so near to me. And he takes it all in, does what the manager says, goes out and is the best player. Forty five minutes were enough to understand.”</p> <p>Garagarza insists: “Mendilibar and José Bordalás at Getafe are a big part of his development and there’s something very good about him: you press him, grab him and make demands of him, shout at him and he always takes it, sees it as a good thing.”</p> <p>Tarín agrees: “That’s his greatest quality. He never takes a criticism personally, never feels attacked. He listens, corrects mistakes, understands.” The week after Valladolid, Cucurella took apart Madrid and never left the team again. The role was perfect, protecting him from some of the early defensive weaknesses Eibar had identified and providing a place to learn.</p> <p>Tarín suggests he benefited from a position that was not so much pure winger as a hybrid role which meant continuing his defensive development and from the kind of experience and education-through-obligation not always available in a youth system at a giant club.</p> <p>“In that sense, it’s vital to leave,” Tarín explains. “I see errors of my own from Barcelona B that seem unthinkable now; when you join a team like that – I went to Leganés, Cucu to Eibar then Getafe – every point is vital for survival and the adversity and the demands, the <em>needs</em>, are necessary to improve, to analyse every action, to see that mistakes just can’t happen.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c2180471a83fb5fc9fe9893c6596fd7d198ea33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c2180471a83fb5fc9fe9893c6596fd7d198ea33/0_0_3401_2239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cucurella takes on Spurs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cucurella takes on Spurs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garagarza admits: “We didn’t imagine he would be a winger, but it worked. He’s not a great goalscorer, hasn’t got a great shot, isn’t strong in the air, doesn’t have the body size for challenges but he has other things: he’s clever, he can pass, he’s daring, plays at high intensity with high repetition. He could combine, build overloads, offer a <em>lot</em> of continuity. He would come inside, between lines, into intermediate positions, recover the ball. He would win second balls when we went long to Sergi [Enrich], which we hadn’t anticipated.

So will he succeed? Yes, yes, I’m absolutely sure of it.”</p> <p>Cote says: “If you had asked me at Eibar if I could imagine him ending up where he is, I might have said no, but he’s such a good player and that year he exploded.

So we’re enjoying it.” <br><br>Gibbs-White, 22, will be reunited with Cooper after spending the first half of the 2020-21 season on loan at Swansea. Forest completed their 15th summer signing last weekend following the arrivals of Emmanuel Dennis, Cheikhou Kouyate and Remo Freuler, who could all be in contention for starting places tomorrow.

He confirmed that Roberto Firmino has returned to fitness and is available for selection. Klopp also addressed the sending-off of Darwin Nunez on his Anfield debut for an impetuous butt to the head of Crystal Palace defender Joachim Andersen on Monday night. </p> \n  <p>“Of course we spoke to Darwin and he was very disappointed with himself,” he said. “The things that the centre-half did, he’s not the only player in the world doing these kinds of things. We’ve never had a situation like this before while I’ve been here as far as I know, so I’m not an expert in these talks but it was obvious that he knew. He apologised. We all make mistakes.”</p> \n  <p>As you might expect, Klopp also dismissed the notion that his players might have it easy against a Manchester United side lining up on the back of a total humiliation at the hands of Brentford last weekend. </p> \n  <p>“United away will never be easy so we try to do our absolute best,\" he said. “Of course. I would prefer to play them after they won 5-0, definitely, but that’s how it is. We drew two games, so is it better to play us in a situation like this? I don’t know. We have to deal with all the situations in the game and at this moment nobody knows what will happen. The whole world will watch it, it’s on Monday so let’s see how these heavyweights deal with the situation.”</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a850428b27afdb0f0f9fa28b65d309f0838d6f5\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a850428b27afdb0f0f9fa28b65d309f0838d6f5/0_0_1889_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jurgen Klopp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"843\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jurgen knows. </span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ff4cf08f080eafb8918aaf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-19T08:58:32.977Z\">9.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">This weekend's top flight fixtures</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>Tottenham v Wolves (Saturday 12.30pm)</p></li> \n   <li><p>Everton v Nottingham Forest (3pm)</p></li> \n   <li><p>Leicester City v Southampton (3pm)</p></li> \n   <li><p>Fulham v Brentford (3pm) </p></li> \n   <li><p>Crystal Palace v Aston Villa (3pm)</p></li> \n   <li><p>Bournemouth v Arsenal (5.30pm) </p></li> \n   <li><p>West Ham v Brighton (Sunday 2pm)</p></li> \n   <li><p>Leeds United v Chelsea (2pm)</p></li> \n   <li><p>Newcastle United v Manchester City (4.30pm) </p></li> \n   <li><p>Manchester United v Liverpool (Monday 8pm)</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/football-transfer-rumours-real-madrid-target-bruno-guimaraes\">Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid target Bruno Guimãraes?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fed02b8f080eafb8918789\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-19T08:58:21.779Z\">9.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">The weekend starts here ...</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And ends on, er … Monday night, what with the relegation six-pointer between Manchester United and Liverpool at Old Trafford being the pick of the Premier League fixtures.

I wasn’t afraid to run her and she’s a phenomenal mare. That’s a win-and-you’re-in for the Breeders’ Cup and that’s the plan. She’s also in the Foret and the Abbaye [at Longchamp in early October] so all being well, it’s two more runs. She’s versatile and five-and-a-half around two turns [at Keeneland] should suit her.”</p> \n<p>The Group Two Lonsdale Cup lost its most recognisable stars in the hours before the off as Stradivarius and then Trueshan, both Group One-winning stayers, were ruled out due to a minor injury and the quick ground respectively. In their absence, though, Quickthorn produced a memorable front-running display to beat his five remaining opponents by a wide margin, having been sent into a clear lead from the off by Tom Marquand.</p> \n<p>Tearaway leaders generally come back to their field in the home straight but it was clear from a long way out that Quickthorn still had plenty of running left.

He’s an improving five-year-old, he’s probably improved a stone this year [and] he’d have certainly given them a race today, wouldn’t he?” Noble Style was cut from 16-1 to 7-1 second-favourite for next year’s 2,000 Guineas by Paddy Power after making plenty of ground from off the pace to cut down Marshman, the favourite, in the closing stages of the Group Two Gimcrack Stakes.</p> \n<p>“I see no reason why he won’t stay a mile [in the Guineas],” Charlie Appleby, the winner’s trainer, said. “His pedigree suggests he’ll get it for sure and he does it all very nicely.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Saturday’s TV tips</strong></h2> \n<p>With a £300,000 first prize, the Ebor Handicap at York on Saturday is worth more to the winner than several of the season’s Group One events and the huge pot of cash on offer has also made it a big target for Irish stables in recent seasons.</p> \n<p>Irish-trained horses have won four of the last eight runnings of the Ebor despite accounting for just 14% of the starters, and three of the top five in the betting – Earl Of Tyrone, Okita Soushi and Licence – appear to have been trained with Saturday’s race in mind for many months.</p> \n<p>Among the home-trained contingent, meanwhile, a first Ebor success would be a huge boost to William Haggas’s challenge for the Flat trainers’ championship, and his two runners, Candleford and Gaassee, go to post with obvious chances on their handicap form this year.</p> \n<p>Both have jumped significantly in the weights as a result of earlier wins, however, whereas Joseph O’Brien’s <strong>Okita Soushi (3.35</strong>) has been running eye-catching races with significantly less effect on his handicap mark.</p> \n<p>His amateur rider gave him too much to do at Leopardstown last month and the form of his earlier two-length third at Royal Ascot, off a 2lb lower mark than here, was franked when the winner won again next time. His hold-up style is ideally suited to Saturday’s race, top apprentice Mikey Sheehy takes off 3lb and he is the clear pick of the prices at around 8-1.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c172d328-e63d-4836-b2db-fd80754a8049\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Newton Abbot:</b> 1.07 Pop The Champagne, 1.42 Lock’s Corner, 2.17 Hooper, 2.52 Romanor, 3.27 Faint Hope, 4.02 Byzantine Empire, 4.35 Al Zaraqaan.</p>\n    <p><b>York:</b> 1.50 Cadillac, 2.25 Caius Chorister (nb), 3.00 Rohaan, 3.35 Okita Soushi (nap), 4.10 Summerghand, 4.45 Treasure Trove, 5.20 Phantom Flight.</p>\n    <p><b>Chester:</b> 1.55 Frankness, 2.30 All The Time, 3.05 Loft, 3.40 Trumble, 4.15 Sampers Seven, 4.50 So Smart, 5.25 The New Marwan.</p>\n    <p><b>Sandown:</b> 2.05 Nizaaka, 2.40 Defence Of Fort, 3.15 Global Esteem, 3.50 Migdam, 4.25 Cruise, 5.00 Urban Sprawl, 5.35 Impeach.</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield:</b> 4.40 Firenze Rosa, 5.15 Eurythmical, 5.50 Paddy Brunty, 6.20 Crown Bridges, 6.50 Raise The Roof, 7.20 Miss Sligo, 7.50 Stormbreaker.</p>\n    <p><b>Chelmsford:</b> 4.51 Street Poet, 5.26 Rock Girl, 6.00 Royal Mariner, 6.35 Nanga Parbat, 7.05 Miss Bella Brand, 7.35 Maylah.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>York 1.50:</strong> A slight drop back in trip could help <strong>Cadillac </strong>to regain the winning thread in his third start after a big-money move to up-and-coming trainer Kevin Philippart de Foy.</p> \n<p><strong>Sandown 2.05:</strong> <strong>Nizaaka </strong>has made swift progress through the handicap ranks this summer and looks ready for this step up to Group Three company.</p> \n<p><strong>York 2.25:</strong> The progressive <strong>Caius Chorister </strong>had more in hand than the margin might suggest last time and could well improve for this step up in trip.</p> \n<p><strong>Sandown 2.40:</strong> <strong>Defence Of Fort, </strong>a convincing winner on debut, could be the pick of a very promising field of two-year-olds.</p> \n<p><strong>York 3.00:</strong> He is most familiar as a top sprint-handicapper but <strong>Rohaan </strong>has winning form at seven furlongs and was not beaten far at Group One level last time, so odds around 6-1 look too big.</p> \n<p><strong>York 4.10:</strong> <strong>Summerghand </strong>ran well from a bad draw at Ripon last time and sets off from a much better pitch here.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/covid-coronavirus-outbreak-tibet-china-tourists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T16:28:35Z","webTitle":"Covid outbreak in Tibet leaves thousands of Chinese tourists stranded","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/covid-coronavirus-outbreak-tibet-china-tourists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/covid-coronavirus-outbreak-tibet-china-tourists","fields":{"headline":"Covid outbreak in Tibet leaves thousands of Chinese tourists stranded","trailText":"Travellers barred from sightseeing or returning home until confirmed clear of disease as authorities struggle to contain cases","byline":"Vincent Ni China affairs correspondent","body":"<p>Thousands of Chinese tourists have been left stranded in Tibet as authorities in the region struggle to contain a fresh Covid outbreak.</p> <p>In recent months, at the same time as many cities went into lockdowns, Chinese tourists have flocked to scenic destinations such as the southern province of Hainan and the western region of Tibet.</p> <p>However, cases have been rising in these destinations in recent weeks.

You can be the champion of Saudi Arabia’s people, by acknowledging their suffering and calling for their rights to be respected by the regime.”</p> <p>A spokesman for Joshua pledged to investigate Al-Khayat’s case. “Anthony takes his responsibility as a global sports figure very seriously and does not condone any form of human rights abuse,” he told the Guardian. “He and his management are grateful for being made aware of this particular situation and will take steps to look into this further post his fight on Saturday night”.</p> <p>The non-governmental organisation Reprieve, which helps people in Saudi Arabia facing the death penalty for childhood crimes, non-violent offences or on charges related to their participation in pro-democracy protests, also offered to meet Joshua when he returns to the UK. “International pressure on Saudi Arabia can make a difference,” it said, pointing to a royal decree in 2020 purportedly abolishing the death penalty for juveniles.</p> <p>Jeed Basyouni, head of Reprieve’s work in the Middle East and North Africa, added: “Mohammed bin Salman is trying to use major sporting events like this to sportswash his blood-soaked regime. Anthony Joshua can change that by using his visit to speak out about human rights to help save lives”.</p> <p>The Guardian has approached Saudi authorities for comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/19/sir-alex-ferguson-says-he-never-saw-ryan-giggs-become-angry-or-aggressive","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T16:07:44Z","webTitle":"Sir Alex Ferguson says he ‘never’ saw Ryan Giggs become angry or aggressive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/sir-alex-ferguson-says-he-never-saw-ryan-giggs-become-angry-or-aggressive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/sir-alex-ferguson-says-he-never-saw-ryan-giggs-become-angry-or-aggressive","fields":{"headline":"Sir Alex Ferguson says he ‘never’ saw Ryan Giggs become angry or aggressive","trailText":"Former Manchester United manager gives evidence at trial of footballer he worked with for 24 years","byline":"Sophie Zeldin-O'Neill","body":"<p>Sir Alex Ferguson has told a court that he never once saw Ryan Giggs lose his temper in his former player’s career.</p> <p>The former Manchester United manager said the footballer had a “fantastic temperament” and that the entire club treated Giggs “as the number one”.</p> <p>Giving evidence in Giggs’s trial on Friday, Ferguson said he “never” saw the footballer become angry or aggressive in the 24 years in which he managed him.</p> <p>Giggs, 48, is on trial for using controlling and coercive behaviour against his ex-girlfriend Kate Greville, 38, between August 2017 and November 2020 – charges that he denies.</p> <p>He also denies assaulting Greville, causing her actual bodily harm, and the common assault of her younger sister, Emma Greville, 26, at his home in Worsley, Greater Manchester on 1 November 2020. </p> <p>Ferguson told Manchester crown court how Giggs had signed a schoolboy form with the club before getting into the first team at the age of 17.</p> <p>Ferguson said: “They [Manchester United] had been going through a bad period when I arrived at the club in 1986.

Taking place almost entirely on board a German submarine during the second world war, it is forensic in its detail, expert in its use of limited space, and eloquent in its anti-war message.</p> <p>Petersen, who has died of pancreatic cancer aged 81, captured the tension and the tedium of the submariners’ lives together, and skilfully shaped episodes of extreme suspense, such as the attempt to escape sonic detection, which pushes the vessel further into the ocean’s depths until the metal groans and the rivets pop. He was alert to what he called “the terrors of silence, which can be even more effective than the loudest sound effect in the world”.</p> <p>An adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/05/guardianobituaries.germany\" title=\"\">Lothar-Günther Buchheim</a>’s mammoth 1973 novel, which drew on the author’s own experiences on a U-boat, Das Boot was first released in a 149-minute version. It earned six Oscar nominations including two for Petersen in the categories of best director and best adapted screenplay. A 300-minute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/06/das-boot-season-two-sky-atlantic\" title=\"\">television edit</a> followed several years later, shown in instalments in Britain and Germany. Finally, Petersen pieced together the 209-minute Das Boot: The Director’s Cut, which played in cinemas in 1997.</p> <p>He was back on the waves again for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jul/28/georgeclooney\" title=\"\">The Perfect Storm</a> (2000), starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg as fishermen risking their lives at sea, and in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/jun/02/2\" title=\"\">Poseidon</a> (2006), an ill-starred remake of The Poseidon Adventure, one of the rare times in his career when he appeared to be treading water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5d265bfeba0e966506833044ae2f4228b1f28ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d265bfeba0e966506833044ae2f4228b1f28ca/0_0_2875_2088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Das Boot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The claustrophobic second world war film Das Boot (1981) gave Wolfgang Petersen his international breakthrough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Constantin Film/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he was nothing if not versatile. The same levels of ingenuity and confidence were apparent whether he was presiding over the children’s fantasy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/03/my-favourite-film-aged-12-the-neverending-story\" title=\"\">The NeverEnding Story</a> (1984), about a boy who enters the pages of a magical book, or the devilishly satisfying cat-and-mouse thriller In the Line of Fire (1993), starring Clint Eastwood as a Secret Service agent taunted by a psychopath played by John Malkovich. “Most thrillers these days are about stunts and action,” noted the critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/04/roger-ebert\" title=\"\">Roger Ebert</a>. “In the Line of Fire has a mind.”</p> <p>The genial and boyish Petersen was an unashamedly commercial director who sought the largest possible audience and attracted many of Hollywood’s biggest stars. Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo battle a deadly virus in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/04/my-guilty-pleasure-outbreak\" title=\"\">Outbreak</a> (1995), which features a memorably unsettling scene of germs being passed between coughing audience members in a darkened cinema; Harrison Ford plays a president whose plane is hijacked by a terrorist (Gary Oldman) in Air Force One (1997); Brad Pitt and Eric Bana clash swords and flex muscles in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1215911,00.html\" title=\"\">Troy</a> (2004), a loose take on the Iliad that grossed nearly $500m. Whatever the genre, Petersen was driven by the same goal. “My passion is telling a story,” he said.</p> <p>He was born in Emden, a German port town near the Dutch border. The son of a naval officer who later worked for a shipping company in Hamburg, Wolfgang was educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg, and developed an interest in film-making at an early age. He received a Super 8 camera for Christmas and had already shot an amateur western, in homage to his favourite film, High Noon, by the age of 14.</p> <p>Even then, Hollywood was in his sights. “I wanted to tell these wonderful stories,” he said in 2001. “And if you start thinking like that, well, at the end of that dream stands Hollywood, because this is the most exciting place to make movies in the world.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b568c84a50e54d5296737985c1f94d1fc15e60ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b568c84a50e54d5296737985c1f94d1fc15e60ef/0_170_2933_1760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy and a dragon in a scene from The NeverEnding Story\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolfgang Petersen displayed his ingenuity and confidence in the 1984 fantasy The NeverEnding Story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Constantin Film/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His earliest directing jobs were in theatre. He then enrolled at the German Film and Television Academy in Berlin. His graduation film, I Will Kill You, Wolf (1971), starring his first wife, Ursula Sieg, was broadcast on television, and soon he was directing episodes of the crime drama Tatort. He alternated between TV work and films, including the thriller One Or the Other (1974) and the sensitively directed gay love story The Consequence (1977). Both those films star his semi-regular collaborator Jürgen Prochnow, who went on to give a quietly magisterial performance as the submarine captain in Das Boot.</p> <p>Following his Oscar nominations and the success of Das Boot, he was much in demand in Hollywood. He took over the allegorical science-fiction drama Enemy Mine (1985), about an unlikely friendship between a human soldier (Dennis Quaid) and his alien counterpart (Lou Gossett Jr) stranded on a distant planet, after the previous director, Richard Loncraine, was sacked. Petersen moved the shoot to the Bavaria studios in Munich, where he had made Das Boot, and ordered new sets to be built, among them a volcanic planet with multiple moons. He also commissioned new makeup designs for the alien character, which took five months to perfect. The resulting film, a costly flop, was fascinatingly strange.</p> <p>The thriller Shattered (1991), which Petersen adapted from Richard Neely’s novel The Plastic Nightmare, stars Tom Berenger as a man piecing his life together after suffering amnesia following a car crash; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/30/bob-hoskins\" title=\"\">Bob Hoskins</a>’ colourful performance as a private detective provides some light and humour in a rather muddled, lurid affair.</p> <p>Petersen returned to Germany to direct his final film, Four Against the Bank (2016), a breezy remake of his own 1976 TV heist caper, Vier gegen die Bank.</p> <p>Das Boot continued to be regarded as his masterpiece. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/06/the-new-and-improved-das-boot-now-with-added-women\" title=\"\">2019 television version</a>, set after the events of the film, was announced by the production company via a tweet designed to forestall protests from fans of the original version: “New submarine.

We would not/will not ever remake the 1981 classic.”</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Maria-Antoinette Borgel, and by a son, Daniel, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1978, and two grandchildren.</p> <p>• Wolfgang Petersen, film director, born 14 March 1941; died 12 August 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/19/jennifer-bartlett-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T15:53:29Z","webTitle":"Jennifer Bartlett obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/19/jennifer-bartlett-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/19/jennifer-bartlett-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Jennifer Bartlett obituary","trailText":"American painter whose systemic yet figurative artworks defied categorisation","byline":"Charles Darwent","body":"<p>In 1987, the BBC aired a documentary called Painting With Light in which six artists were filmed making work with a computer graphics system called Quantel Paintbox. One of the six was Jennifer Bartlett, who has died of leukaemia aged 81.</p> <p>Bartlett was variously the odd one out in the series. All the other artists – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/aug/17/guardianobituaries.arts\" title=\"\">Larry Rivers</a>, David Hockney, Sidney Nolan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/13/richard-hamilton-obituary\" title=\"\">Richard Hamilton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/09/sir-howard-hodgkin-obituary\" title=\"\">Howard Hodgkin</a> – were men. Not coincidentally, they remain household names in the modern art world, where the prodigiously creative Bartlett is now rather less well known than she was 35 years ago. But she also stood out from the six in being the hardest of them to pigeonhole, her art defining itself by being defiantly unlike anybody else’s.</p> <p>Typical of this was the work with which she had made her name a decade before, a <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/100190\" title=\"\">47-metre-long mural called Rhapsody</a> (1975-76), now in New York’s Museum of Modern Art. Size was not its sole oddity. Travelling on the city’s subway in 1968, Bartlett’s eye had been caught by the network’s signage. “The signs looked like hard paper,” she recalled. “I wanted a unit that could go around corners on the wall, stack for shipping. If you made a painting and wanted it to be longer, you could add plates. If you didn’t like the middle you could remove it.” With $500 borrowed from a friend, she ordered 100 foot-square enamelled steel plates from P Feiner &amp; Sons, a sign manufacturer in New Jersey. Seven years later, these became the basic unit of Rhapsody.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7c73b246486492ac4251b901777f65938da507e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7c73b246486492ac4251b901777f65938da507e/256_297_3666_2199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A section of the 47-metre-long artwork Rhapsody (1975-76), which consists of 987 metal plates individually painted, subdivided, or left blank, to make up a larger, pixellated image.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A section of the 47-metre-long artwork Rhapsody (1975-76), by Jennifer Bartlett, which consists of 987 metal plates individually painted, subdivided, or left blank, to make up a larger, pixellated image.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was not quite as eccentric as it sounds. Fifty years earlier, in Weimar, the Bauhaus artist László Moholy-Nagy had had enamel-on-steel paintings made for him by a sign maker, ringing in his order for them by telephone. Pretty well every American artist of Bartlett’s generation experimented with industrial materials. What made the 987 white plates of Rhapsody different from all these was that they appeared in some way domestic – “like a refrigerator”, as Bartlett said.</p> <p>The use she put the plates to was also unexpected. Arranged on the wall in the familiar modernist grid and further subdivided into quarter-inch squares silkscreened on to each plate, they seemed tied to early conceptual movements – <a href=\"https://www.artforum.com/print/196609/systemic-painting-36815\" title=\"\">systemic art</a>, perhaps. Bartlett either painted each gridded mini-square with a blob of craft enamel or left it blank, so that a pixellated image emerged. (Inevitably, Bartlett being a woman, this process was compared to embroidery, or knitting.)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/research/in-focus/surface-substitution\" title=\"\">Surface Substitution on 36 Plates (1972), in the Tate collection</a>, is typical of her work of the time. The resultant images might be either abstract or representational – “I think an abstract painting is actually more figurative than a figurative painting, because it is closer to the thing it is depicting,” Bartlett said – the latter drawn from a repertoire of forms that would remain a mainstay of her art for the rest of her career: a tree, the sea, a mountain, a red-roofed house with a white picket fence. Representational and abstract, intimate and monumental, systematised and impulsive, Rhapsody broke every rule of the art of its day by signing up to them all. Asked what Rhapsody was about, Bartlett cheerily replied: “Everything.”</p> <p>The work made her famous, and – it sold for the then astronomical sum of $45,000 – well-to-do. By 1985, Bartlett was being given monograph shows that travelled the US: the first went from Brooklyn to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. She had already won a coveted place in the 1977 Documenta art exhibition in Kassel, Germany, and her work had been hung in the US Pavilion at the 1980 Venice Biennale alongside that of Laurie Anderson and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/01/christo-obituary\" title=\"\">Christo</a>. As with Rhapsody, the art Bartlett made in the 1980s remained natural in an unnatural way. Her 1980-83 series, In the Garden, showed 200 different views of a small repertoire of motifs from the garden of her villa in Nice. This was reprised, in the early 2000s, in the garden of her studio in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, the works’ cross-hatched surface a sign of Bartlett’s painterly intent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fe361ced427a8b50fff1c62f7057b30b3ffa6ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fe361ced427a8b50fff1c62f7057b30b3ffa6ec/1872_84_2134_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A further section of Rhapsody, 1975-76, which Bartlett said was about ‘everything’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A further section of Rhapsody, 1975-76, which Jennifer Bartlett said was about ‘everything’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All this was a far cry from her childhood in Long Beach, California. The first of four children of Joanne (nee Chaffee), a graphic artist turned housewife, and Edward Losch, a businessman with interests in construction, Jennifer nursed a desire to escape to New York from an early age. “My mother would have liked for me to have gotten a job at Hallmark cards, done some painting on the side, gotten happily married, had some children and lived in Long Beach,” she later told People magazine. </p> <p>After a BA at Mills College in Oakland in 1963, freedom came in the form of an MFA at Yale. The two years Bartlett spent studying alongside the likes of Richard Serra, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/aug/20/chuck-close-obituary\" title=\"\">Chuck Close</a> and Michael Craig-Martin opened her eyes to modern art. So, too, the proximity of New York, 90 minutes away from New Haven by train. By 1968, she was living in the city; her first show, in 1970, was in the flat of an artist friend. The system behind the works in this was predicated on the avoidance of certain colours. “I felt no need whatsoever for orange or violet,” Bartlett said, “but I did need green.”</p> <p>Like many early <em>coups de succès</em>, Rhapsody came with its problems. In the mind of the public (and the art market), Bartlett was defined by her trademark white plates. Refusing to be bound by this stereotype, she spent the years from the mid-80s to the turn of the century making large-scale figurative paintings, some of which – <a href=\"https://www.locksgallery.com/exhibitions/jennifer-bartlett20/a-news\" title=\"\">Sea Wall (1985)</a>, for example – were paired in the gallery with sculptures of themselves. None was ever quite as successful as Rhapsody had been.</p> <p>In 1996, Bartlett left her long-term gallerist, Paula Cooper, and, for the ensuing two decades, showed mainly outside New York. In 2016 she returned to Cooper, having already gone back to her white plates. Until blurred by the dementia of her last years, her energy remained undiminished: she turned her hand to a startling variety of media, from theatre design to glassware to printmaking. In 2001, she had watched the events of 11 September unfold from the roof of her Greenwich Village flat. Her painting of the scene – <a href=\"https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/240526\" title=\"\">Goodbye, Bill, now in the Yale University Art Gallery</a> – is one of the few representations in art of the horrors of that day.</p> <p>Bartlett married twice: first, in 1964, to Edward Bartlett, a physician; and second, in 1983, to the German actor Mathieu Carrière. Both marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by a daughter from the second, Alice.</p> <p>• Jennifer Losch Bartlett, artist, born 14 March 1941; died 25 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-forced-again-to-deny-link-to-banking-tax-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T15:52:11Z","webTitle":"German chancellor forced again to deny link to banking tax scandal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-forced-again-to-deny-link-to-banking-tax-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-forced-again-to-deny-link-to-banking-tax-scandal","fields":{"headline":"German chancellor forced again to deny link to banking tax scandal","trailText":"Previously unseen emails put former Hamburg mayor Olaf Scholz back in spotlight over €300m fraud scheme","byline":"Philip Oltermann in Berlin","body":"<p>The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Friday again denied allegations that he held a protecting hand over a local bank found guilty of a multimillion euro tax fraud scheme while he was mayor of Hamburg, as the centre-left politician was questioned by a state parliamentary committee in the northern city for a second time.</p> <p>“I did not influence the Warburg tax procedure,” Scholz said at the start of the session. “There was no political influence on the tax procedure.”</p> <p>Hamburg-based MM Warburg &amp; Co, Germany’s oldest and largest private bank, is alleged to have swindled the German state out of an estimated €300m through the so-called “cum-ex” scheme between at least 2007 and 2011.</p> <p>Cum-ex deals involve trading shares at high speed on or just before the dividend record date – the day the company checks its records to identify shareholders – and then claiming two or more refunds for capital gains tax that had in fact been paid to the state only once.</p> <p>The name refers to rapidly traded shares with (“cum”) and without (“ex”) dividend rights.

I am convinced that this understanding won’t change, that’s very clear after two and a half years.”</p> <p>Prosecutors in Hamburg backed the chancellor’s stance on Tuesday this week, rejecting a legal complaint seeking to open criminal proceedings against Scholz and ruling they had so far seen no reason to investigate him.</p> <p>Delegates of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and leftwing Die Linke in Hamburg want to expand the investigative committee’s reach to also look into the cum-ex activities of Hamburg Commercial Bank (formerly HSH Nordbank), which would probably lead to more appearances by the chancellor.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/19/energy-bills-crisis-uk-health-equality-chancellor","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T15:47:34Z","webTitle":"UK energy bills crisis could set back health equality by decades, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/19/energy-bills-crisis-uk-health-equality-chancellor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/19/energy-bills-crisis-uk-health-equality-chancellor","fields":{"headline":"UK energy bills crisis could set back health equality by decades, say experts","trailText":"Chancellor told failure to act would hit services as poverty, cold and missed meals increase sickness rates","byline":"Peter Walker Political correspondent","body":"<p>A failure to tackle soaring energy bills could set back health equality by decades and see the NHS faced with a “humanitarian crisis” of people unable to keep warm or eat properly, NHS leaders and public health experts have warned.</p> <p>With one help service receiving calls from almost 100 people in a single day who had had their power disconnected, there are fears that many clinically vulnerable people could die or be forced to stay in hospital because it is unsafe to send them back to a freezing home.</p> <p>In an unprecedented intervention, the NHS Confederation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/nhs-leaders-warn-of-humanitarian-crisis-if-government-doesnt-act-on-energy-costs\">wrote to Nadhim Zahawi</a>, the chancellor, on Friday to warn that a failure to act would pile pressure on stretched health services, as poverty, cold and missed meals pushed up rates of sickness.</p> <p>The organisation, which represents the health service across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said there was also a wider risk of severe and long-term damage to children’s life chances, further exacerbating already stark health inequalities.</p> <p>Matthew Taylor, the NHS Confederation chief executive, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/09/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-4266-from-january\">the forecast rise</a> in energy bills to about £4,200 annually for the average household would come when health service was already “likely to experience the most difficult winter on record”.</p> <p>He said: “The country is facing a humanitarian crisis. Many people could face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions. This, in turn, could lead to outbreaks of illness and sickness around the country and widen health inequalities, worsen children’s life chances, and leave an indelible scar on local communities.”</p> <p>Public health officials are deeply alarmed at the potential lifelong impact on children because of the stress of poverty and deprivation, an experience shown to affect brain development and increase the likelihood of ill health, suicide and substance abuse in adult life.</p> <p>Alice Wiseman, the director of public health in Gateshead, said disadvantaged communities in her area had already faced “a tsunami” of challenges in the past few years, and she was deeply worried about the impact of energy bills.</p> <p>“The stress and anxiety of poverty can have such a long-term effect,” she said. “This is our next public health crisis. If nothing is done, it would set public health back by decades.”</p> <p>Alison Dunn, chief executive of Citizens Advice Gateshead, said the service nationally had received 95 calls in one day from people saying they could no longer add credit to pre-payment meters and so were without power.</p> <p>In Gateshead alone, the scale of the crisis was hard to comprehend, especially for more vulnerable or disabled people, she added: “We had a lady who said she was frightened to use her stairlift, and was going to have to choose where she lived in the house, but the bathroom is upstairs and the kitchen is downstairs.</p> <p>“These are people who are already on the edge, and it’s still the summer. When winter comes, there are some people for whom cold homes are potentially life-threatening. There will be people who cannot be released from hospitals into cold homes. There will be deaths.”</p> <p>Dunn’s team has begun working with hospitals to provide an advice service for people with respiratory conditions who cannot afford to have a warm home, she said: “But there’s more work than we can do. How we can possibly respond to this level of need?”</p> <p>Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said the NHS Confederation had been “absolutely right to raise concerns about the impact on health”. “Families are really worried about how they are going to afford soaring energy bills this winter,” he said. “Many will be plunged into poverty by this cost of living crisis and be forced to make choices between eating and heating.”</p> <p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax\">proposed a freeze on bills</a> by fixing the current price cap. Ministers have offered a blanket £400 grant, with some extra help for poorer households. However, with Boris Johnson departing as prime minister in just over a fortnight, any further measures would be left to his successor, either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>Sunak has promised to reduce VAT on bills, while Truss’s main offer is a national insurance cut, which would disproportionately help wealthier people.</p> <p>A study released this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/17/two-thirds-of-uk-families-could-be-in-fuel-poverty-by-january-research-finds\">estimates that by January</a>, two-thirds of all UK households will face fuel poverty, which means energy costs exceed 10% of a household’s net income. For pensioner couples, this would rise to 86.4%, and to 90.4% for single parents with two or more children.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/aug/19/england-v-south-africa-first-test-day-three-live-score-updates-cricket","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T15:38:25Z","webTitle":"South Africa rout England by innings and 12 runs – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/aug/19/england-v-south-africa-first-test-day-three-live-score-updates-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/aug/19/england-v-south-africa-first-test-day-three-live-score-updates-cricket","fields":{"headline":"South Africa rout England by innings and 12 runs – as it happened ","trailText":"South Africa roll England for 149 in 37.4 overs to win inside three days.

We’ve been behind in the last four Tests and able to absorb the pressure before turning it back onto the opposition but we weren’t able to do that this time.” Asked about the aggressive manner, and whether that held them back at times this week? “I think at times we were a bit timid,” he laughs. “You’ve got to buckle up for the ride.” Asked to elaborate on the ‘timid’ comment? Says there were times they could have gone harder at bowlers but doesn’t give much else away. “This is a new approach the skipper and I are taking on… it won’t always be rainbow and butterflies, which takes some getting used to. That won’t be easy for some but that’s life sometimes as well.”</p> <p>What will he say to the team? “You don’t become a bad team in the space of one game. We’ll maintain a level head and work out where we can get better. Day one was very difficult to bat and the toss was quite important and they were able to utilise the conditions better than we were able to.” </p> <p>What about the five-week gap between red-ball games? Undercooked? “I don’t think so. I didn’t mind the break. It gave the guys a chance to let it sink in; it was a special six weeks and we beat two very good teams. We came here with high expectations but moments when the game was in the balance we weren’t able to capitalise on.”</p> <p>The Crawley question comes. “His technique and his style what we are asking for him is to chase great moments.” Adds that when he gets in he had to make the most of it but repeats the earlier observation that his style of play means he won’t be a consistent opener and that’s discomfort that everyone needs to get used to. </p> <p>Same XI in Manchester next week? “I’d like to see the wicket,” he says.

Since cricket is so unpredictable and unrepeatable and therefore open to any possibilities, why not continue with OBO even if there are no real matches in play? You, the commentators can make things up as you go along, you know how games progress and how teams do or don’t play, so you could just invent a series of tests to see us through the down periods. And we, the avids out here in OBOland will be able to contentedly read about batters and bowlers even though they are only playing in fantasy matches, and continue to write in and enjoy the virtual comradeship, the shared jokes, wisdom, insights of the OBO tribe.</p> <p><br>The alternative is alcohol, drugs, crime, violence, and worst of all, politix <em><strong>(please, none of that, or at least not all of that)</strong></em>.

One might argue that the English attack lacks the genuine pace that the South Africans have and we know that that tailenders hate that extra oomph. Still.

Four remarkable fourth innings chases. Four swashbuckling tons from Johnny Bairstow.</p> <p>The start of the summer felt like the breaking of a new dawn for England’s red ball team.

I’m sure all of us have gone through it at some point but we’ve still not even said anything to each other because it feels like a massive taboo that isn’t discussed.”</p> <p>Lansiquot also pointed out it was not as easy as taking the pill. “The side-effects of all the medication you can take are still really unknown,” she said. “I would love in five or 10 years’ time for this not to be a hush-hush conversation and for it to be something you can talk about and conquer instead of having to shy away from.”</p> <p>Ashleigh Nelson, also a member of the relay team who has been part of the GB squad since the Beijing Olympics, was another to speak out. “If this was a man’s issue, we would be dealing with it,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s very difficult that once a month you have to plan your training, your diet, your life around having a period. There are things you can take to postpone your period but they also have side-effects so you’re in a Catch-22. You can’t win. But it’s part of being a woman and a lot of us handle it very well.”</p> <p>The women are strong favourites on Saturday, with Asha Philip praising the team’s unity. “This summer, we’ve seen each other more than we see anyone else and we’ve created such a fantastic bond together,” she said. “No matter what team you put out, no matter who does what leg, we’re going to excel.”</p> <p>The men’s 4x100m team believe they will also win gold despite the absence of Reece Prescod, who has decided to go home.

We have a lot of kind souls in the group that all want to progress well.” When it was put to Aikines-Aryeetey that he was the team’s Sir Alex Ferguson figure in the squad, he laughed and pointed to his teammates. “Yeah, but you’ll have to ask them,” To which Efoloko replied: “Yeah, but he’s our player-manager too.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Britain’s Keely Hodgkinson, who has won Olympic, world and Commonwealth silver medals in the past year, won her heat to underline her favourite status for Saturday’s 800m final. Afterwards she made it clear she was determined to win gold.</p> <p>“I’ve just been told I didn’t smile enough today, but I’m tired, that’s why,” Hodgkinson said. “I’m definitely on the home straight now. I’m tired but I do training reps tired so I’m going to be all right. I believe in my capabilities and what I can do.”</p> <p>“Winning gold is a big thing,” added Hodgkinson, who will face the Britons Jemma Reekie and Alexandra Bell in the final. “I’d just like to be on top of the podium this year. I wrote down my aims and I was going into every champs wanting to win. Unfortunately that hasn’t happened but I’m still very happy with my season overall.” <br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/19/prince-william-charity-royal-foundation-bank-jp-morgan-fossil-fuel-backers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T15:19:38Z","webTitle":"Prince William charity uses bank that is one of world’s biggest fossil fuel backers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/prince-william-charity-royal-foundation-bank-jp-morgan-fossil-fuel-backers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/prince-william-charity-royal-foundation-bank-jp-morgan-fossil-fuel-backers","fields":{"headline":"Prince William charity uses bank that is one of world’s biggest fossil fuel backers","trailText":"Royal Foundation also places investments in trust that owns shares in firms that buy palm oil, investigation reveals","byline":"Caroline Davies and agency","body":"<p>The charity founded by the Duke of Cambridge, who launched the <a href=\"https://earthshotprize.org/\">Earthshot prize</a>, keeps its investments in a bank that is one of the world’s biggest backers of fossil fuels, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-entertainment-forests-royalty-prince-william-921652eb91ede88601bf1a534e14448b\">according to an investigation</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://royalfoundation.com/\">The Royal Foundation</a>, the charity set up by the Cambridges, also places more than half of its investments in a fund – advertised as green – that owns shares in large food companies. Some of these firms buy palm oil from companies linked to deforestation, the investigation by the Associated Press (AP) claimed.</p> <p>Prince William, a keen environmentalist, is quoted on the websites of the Earthshot prize and Royal Foundation as saying: “The Earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice.”</p> <p>Yet in 2021 the charity kept more than £1.1m with JP Morgan Chase, according to the most recent filings, and still invests with the corporation, AP reported. The foundation also held £1.7m in a fund run by the British firm Cazenove Capital, according to the 2021 filing, the agency said.</p> <p>As with JP Morgan, it still keeps funds with Cazenove, which in May had securities allegedly linked to deforestation through the use of palm oil. The foundation invested similar amounts in both funds in 2020, its older filings show. As of December 2021, the charity also held more than £10m in cash, it was reported.</p> <p>The investments, which are not disputed by the foundation, come as scientists repeatedly warn the world must shift away from fossil fuels to reduce emissions and avoid more and increasingly intense extreme weather events.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, a Kensington Palace spokesperson said: “The Royal Foundation has followed the Church of England guidelines on ethical investment since 2015, and goes beyond these to prohibit investment in fossil fuel companies. We take our investment policies extremely seriously and review them regularly.”</p> <p>The foundation stressed Cazenove was instructed to operate within its strict investment policy that follows the C of E investment guidance, and additionally its exclusions on fossil fuel companies.</p> <p>A small management fee is paid on its investment to JP Morgan Asset Management and Cazenove Charity Responsible Multi-Asset Fund. The trustees take overall responsibility for the charity and its work, the foundation said.</p> <p>Compared with some other charities, the Royal Foundation’s investments are said to be small, with little impact on the climate crisis. But they are not in line with the ethos of the foundation, which lists conservation and mental health as main points of emphasis, or William’s public statements, AP reported.</p> <p>The Earthshot prize, a “global search for solutions to save our planet”, awards grants of up £1m each year to projects confronting environmental challenges. In July the Royal Foundation announced the prize had become an independent charity and William would be its president.</p> <p>JP Morgan Asset Management declined to comment on questions about charities investing in its products despite its record of financing fossil fuels, AP said.</p> <p>Bloomberg datashows JP Morgan has underwritten more bonds and loans for the fossil fuel industry and earned greater fees than its competitors in the five years up to 2021, it said.</p> <p>The environmental NGO Rainforest Action Network looked at direct loans and stock ownership along with bonds and estimated that between 2016 and 2021, JP Morgan’s banking arm financed fossil fuel companies with $382bn (£320bn). This was more than any other bank, AP reported.</p> <p>While the Cazenove fund is marketed as “sustainable”, as of 31 May the fund held almost $6m of shares in Nestlé, and shares worth $8.1m in Reckitt Benckiser, according to Morningstar Direct data, AP reported. Nestlé and Reckitt Benckiser have faced claims over palm oil supplies from Papua New Guinea, the NGO said.</p> <p>Kate Rogers, the head of sustainability at Cazenove Capital, told AP the company had engaged with Nestlé and Reckitt, and had seen progress on deforestation.<br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/19/uk-small-businesses-forced-to-close-by-soaring-energy-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T15:14:28Z","webTitle":"‘Lost generation’: small businesses folding across UK as energy bills land","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/19/uk-small-businesses-forced-to-close-by-soaring-energy-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/19/uk-small-businesses-forced-to-close-by-soaring-energy-bills","fields":{"headline":"‘Lost generation’: small businesses folding across UK as energy bills land","trailText":"Jobs disappear and high streets decimated as growing number of traders are forced to shut due to higher costs","byline":"Joanna Partridge","body":"<p>The energy crisis is tearing through Britain’s high streets, with warnings on Friday of a “lost generation” of small businesses, as the impact of soaring gas and electricity prices begins to hit cafes, restaurants, shops and salons.</p> <p>Across the UK, growing numbers of traders are closing their doors for good in the face of unaffordable costs driven by record inflation, with some reporting tenfold increases in utility bills.</p> <p>In yet another flashing red light for the economy, which is forecast by the Bank of England to fall into recession next year, data published on Friday by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) shows that a majority of firms – 53% – expect to stagnate, shrink or fold in the coming 12 months.</p> <p>The industry body called on government to act now to shield traders. “Without help, we are facing a generation of lost businesses, jobs and potential,” said Tina McKenzie, the policy and advocacy chair at the FSB.</p> <p>Smaller traders, which employ 16 million people between them, do not benefit from the energy price cap, which puts a ceiling on costs for households but not for companies.</p> <p>The huge jump in prices is slowly filtering through to businesses as their fixed-term contracts – some of which last for several years – expire, and many have been shocked by the increase as bills land on their doormats.

LaFlamme called the decision “liberating” and told viewers she wished she had made the move sooner.</p> <p>But on Thursday, the Globe and Mail <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-lisa-laflamme-ctv-grey-hair/\">reported</a> that Michael Melling, a senior executive at CTV News, had “asked who had approved the decision to ‘let Lisa’s hair go grey’”. Melling and LaFlamme also clashed over journalistic issues before Melling eventually told LaFlamme that her contract was being ended, the Globe and Mail reported.</p> <p>LaFlamme has worked for CTV News for the last 35 years, reporting from conflict zones and the sites of devastating natural disasters. She recently won Best News Anchor at the Canadian Screen Awards.</p> <p>Shock at her departure spread quickly throughout Canadian journalism, with political and business leaders also weighing in.</p> <p>The former Alberta premier Rachel Notley <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RachelNotley/status/1559277719745019905\">called</a> LaFlamme “a massive voice in Canadian media” and former environment minister Catherine McKenna <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cathmckenna/status/1559290148944240640\">called the treatment</a> of the veteran journalist “appallingly shoddy”.</p> <p>Others alluded to perceptions of sexism and ageism. Arlene Dickinson, a prominent investor, praised LaFlamme for ageing “gracefully” on national TV and inspiring others.</p> <p>“Then the folks at CTV brought their female ageism to work,” Dickinson said.</p> <p>In a statement, CTV’s parent company, Bell Media, said LaFlamme’s removal as anchor was a response to “changing viewer habits”.</p> <p>It did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations that LaFlamme’s hair colour played a role in her removal.</p> <p>But at a tense company town hall meeting on Thursday, executives denied LaFlamme’s termination was motivated by her age or gender.</p> <p>“I’m a woman. I’m a woman. I’ve been here for 25 years. Do you really think that I would fire a woman because she’s a woman?” said senior vice-president Karine Moses after pointed questions from LaFlamme’s executive producer, Rosa Hwang, over why she was dropped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b83530f18157ffbdce39b8f76e19d7641d9ca6c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b83530f18157ffbdce39b8f76e19d7641d9ca6c1/0_173_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa LaFlamme interviews the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa LaFlamme interviews the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in 2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Friday, the company said in a statement that it took allegations of discrimination “very seriously” and was taking steps to initiate an independent, third-party internal workplace review. The company also said it “regrets” the way in which it handled LaFlamme’s exit from CTV as it “may have left viewers with the wrong impression” that her three-decades career wasn’t valued by the company.</p> <p>The furore over LaFlamme’s termination has highlighted the challenges women – even those at the top of their field – face on a daily basis, said Amanda Watson, a sociologist at Simon Fraser university</p> <p>“Like many of us, I feel shocked and not surprised,” Watson said. “I have a suspicion that her losing her job because she went grey can’t possibly be what happened. And at the same time, I feel <em>of course</em> that’s what happened … Every time I look in the mirror these days I ask why I’m [colouring my hair]. I don’t have to. I’m a professor!”</p> <p>Watson said the decision by the network had an undercurrent of misogyny and sent a strong signal about societal expectations to other women.</p> <p>“Many women won’t get the opportunity to challenge those frontlines of expectation within themselves,” said Watson. “It’s often not an option to stop maintaining one’s body hair when the standards of professionalization make or break someone’s ability to put food on the table.”</p> <p>Others pointed out an apparent double standard, which allows men to show their age and keep working. Prominent Canadian news anchors like Peter Mansbridge and Lloyd Robertson – whom LaFlamme replaced when he retired at age 77 – enjoyed far longer careers and received carefully produced send-offs.</p> <p>“This isn’t just that we don’t tolerate ageing in public in this kind of position – it’s that we apparently don’t want to look at ageing women. We still trust the authority and character and warmth and familiarity and comfort of ageing men,” said Watson. “It all just feels like the same story line all over again. It’s a cliche and it’s irritating.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/19/marks-spencer-recycling-marble-arch-store-redevelopment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T15:02:36Z","webTitle":"M&S stands by plan to raze Oxford Street store as it rejects complaints","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/marks-spencer-recycling-marble-arch-store-redevelopment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/19/marks-spencer-recycling-marble-arch-store-redevelopment","fields":{"headline":"M&S stands by plan to raze Oxford Street store as it rejects complaints","trailText":"Firm says 95% of materials in existing building will be recycled or reused as it resists pressure from author Bill Bryson and architects","byline":"Sarah Butler","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> has pledged that 95% of the materials in its existing Marble Arch building in Oxford Street in central London will be recovered, recycled or reused as it fights back against heavy opposition to its plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/09/m-and-s-oxford-street-store-marks-spencer-covid-crisis\">flatten the shop</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/m-and-s-oxford-street-london-store-plan-opposed-by-author-bill-bryson-and-architects-carbon-footprint\">M&amp;S Oxford Street store plan opposed by author Bill Bryson and architects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the run-up to an inquiry into the scheme, scheduled to begin on 25 October, the retailer said some materials would be reused directly on-site within its new building as part of its efforts to “promote circular economy principles”.</p> <p>The former communities secretary Michael Gove announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/21/michael-gove-inquiry-marks-spencer-oxford-street-demolition-rebuild-co2-concerns\">an inquiry</a> into the future of the store in June after vocal opposition emerged to M&amp;S’s plan to raze the building, which had been approved by the local council and the Greater London Authority.</p> <p>The retailer said Westminster council, which switched from Conservative to Labour control this year, continued to support the scheme.</p> <p>However, the author Bill Bryson and architects including the Stirling prize winner Steve Tompkins, and Mark Hines, the project director for the remodelling of BBC Broadcasting House, are among those opposing the plan.</p> <p>Bryson, best known for Notes from a Small Island and A Short History of Nearly Everything, has donated £500 to a <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/SAVE-MandS\">fighting fund</a> established by the campaign group Save Britain’s Heritage, which has so far collected more than £11,000 of its £20,000 target.</p> <p>The M&amp;S building has become a poster child for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/24/not-just-any-building-why-plans-for-ms-flagship-store-hit-a-raw-nerve\">debate over a shift to retrofitting</a> and refurbishing structures rather than demolition and rebuilding, in an effort to cut the carbon footprint of redevelopment amid the climate crisis.</p> <p>Opponents say the scheme, designed by the architecture firm Pilbrow &amp; Partners, would release almost 40,000 tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Sacha Berendji, the group operations director of M&amp;S, said the new building would use less than a quarter of the energy of the current structure on completion.</p> <p>He added that Orchard House, the 1929 Portland Stone building at the heart of the group’s plan, accounted for just 30% of the structures being knocked down.</p> <p>“Even a heavy refurbishment of the buildings would involve more embodied carbon and leave structural flaws unremedied, limiting our options to improve energy usage,” he said.</p> <p>“In addition to carbon reduction, our investment will deliver a better place to shop for our customers, a better place to work for our colleagues, and a better public realm for our local community.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/19/work-pay-labour-food-banks-angela-rayner-rachel-reeves","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T15:00:13Z","webTitle":"Work doesn’t pay.

For too many people, work no longer pays. It is a scandal that <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/data/workers-poverty\">5 million working people are living in poverty</a>. There is no clearer sign of a broken system.</p> \n<p>People are worn out not just with their jobs, but financial stress. No one should have to lie awake at night worrying whether they’ll be able to feed their children. Having a warm, decent home and an occasional meal out should not be a luxury. Two-thirds of adults in poverty are in work. The proportion has been rising and has never been higher.</p> \n<p>Both of us represent constituencies in the north of England. We have to refer working people to food banks and clothing exchanges. We have met teaching staff in Manchester and Leeds who go into school early to provide breakfast for pupils, often out of their own pockets. We can’t bear to see people being held back like this or to see potential being wasted in grinding poverty. We all deserve better.</p> \n<p>But this isn’t just because of the cost of living crisis. It is a consequence of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/uk-wages-in-june-fall-at-fastest-rate-for-20-years\">low-wage crisis</a> from more than a decade of squeezed pay under the Conservatives. Average pay, adjusted for inflation, was lower in May 2022 than in February 2008. We need lasting change to how work and workers are valued in our country.</p> \n<p>We are proud that the last Labour government created the national minimum wage. We won the argument then, but we now need to go further to help restore dignity at work and make sure work pays. That is why the next Labour government will change the Low Pay Commission’s remit so that – alongside median wages and economic conditions – the minimum wage will for the first time reflect the need for working people’s pay to at least cover the cost of living. Finally, the national living wage will live up to its name.</p> \n<p>Young adult workers are still getting a raw deal on pay. Their bills aren’t any cheaper, but they have to make ends meet with less. That’s just not fair. Labour will take steps to ensure our genuine national living wage applies to every adult worker and is properly enforced. We would also keep a link to median earnings so that all workers benefit from growth.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/who-pays-the-real-living-wage-in-britain-and-who-does-not\">Who pays the ‘real living wage’ in Britain – and who does not?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many employers already pay a real living wage and that is to be commended. They should not be undercut by those who don’t, which is why we need a level playing field. Working people contribute so much to the wealth of our country. It is only right that they receive a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. But there is a wider economic case too. People’s disposable income is spent on products and services that provide a direct return to our economy and public finances, as well as helping our high streets thrive. When working people’s pay is squeezed, that removes spending power from the economy.</p> \n<p>Poverty pay doesn’t just cause financial misery, it undermines many of the things that matter in life. Being compelled to accept every bit of overtime or take an extra part-time job to pay the bills comes at a cost to relationships and mental health. Worn-out parents with less time for family can be damaging for children growing up too.</p> \n<p>There are couples who barely get to see each other because they are working extra hours to keep their family finances afloat. They are mentally and emotionally exhausted. That’s not sustainable and it’s not the standard of living we should tolerate in Britain.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"371db71c-8ada-4ce6-9716-4db20c47838d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZvwCH4ScMQs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Families are worried about how they will pay their bills, and instead of fixing the real issues, the Conservatives continue their infighting, offering no substantive ideas to help the British public meet the challenges they face. Labour’s plan to freeze the energy price cap would fix the problems immediately and for the future. It would mean people not paying a penny more on their energy bills this winter, saving the typical household £1,000.</p> \n<p>But Labour’s plan for a stronger, more secure economy would ensure that economic growth raises average wages too. We know that the historically low rates of union membership and collective bargaining have been a brake on good work and fair pay across many sectors of the UK economy.</p> \n<p>That is why in sectors such as social care, which have been overlooked and undervalued for so long, the next Labour government will roll out fair pay agreements that will empower unions and the workers they represent to negotiate better pay and conditions, going higher than the living wage and driving up standards across the economy. As well as improving workers’ lives, this is a vital step to deal with the recruitment and retention issues plaguing services such as care.</p> \n<p>As we travel the country and meet people, it’s a world away from the imaginations of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, who would rather accuse working people of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/17/its-a-despicable-stance-readers-on-liz-truss-graft-remark\">lack of “graft”</a> than take responsibility for Conservative failure. Those living in poverty often describe the feeling in the pit of their stomach, worrying about how ends will meet. That feeling is all too widespread on the streets of today’s Britain, with women and those from underrepresented backgrounds more likely to be consigned to poverty pay. Labour will ensure that working people are not just seen as collateral damage from an economy that is not working. While the Conservatives threaten the limited rights people already have, we will guarantee a real living wage and strengthen individual and collective rights for working people.</p> \n<p>We were both teenagers when Labour won power back in 1997 but we cannot and will not forget the transformational impact the minimum wage had back then on so many, or the false arguments of those who conspired to block it. Now is the time to build on that achievement and take the next step. Labour knows that working people are the backbone of our economy and in government we will make work pay once again.</p> \n<p>Angela Rayner is Labour’s deputy leader; Rachel Reeves is shadow chancellor</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Although Labour is not calling for regional rates, instead proposing a single UK-wide statutory minimum wage, it has not ruled this out as a future policy.</p> <p>The party has not said how much the minimum wage could be expected to increase by under its plan to take the cost of living into account. </p> <p>However, the Living Wage Foundation, which encourages UK employers to voluntarily adopt a higher rate of £9.90 an hour, makes its calculation based on the cost of a basket of household goods and services.</p> <p>If Labour’s minimum wage were to be set at the same level, it would mean a worker aged 23 or above taking home an extra £832 a year, based on a 40-hour week. Those aged between 21 and 22 would get almost £1,500 more, while those aged between 18 and 20 would earn more than £6,000 more a year.</p> <p>At last year’s Labour conference, members voted in favour of a £15-an-hour minimum wage amid a row over the policy – but the party’s official position remained to call for an increase to at least £10 an hour.</p> <p>Ross Holden, a national research and policy officer for the GMB union, said: “We have long called for reform of the Low Pay Commission, and this welcome announcement is an important step in the right direction. Young workers are particularly hard hit by the cost of living crisis, and the discriminatory age bandings cannot be abolished quickly enough. Wages should never be based on ages.”</p> <p>Paddy Lillis, the general secretary of Usdaw, said the union was delighted at the announcement. “There is no justification for two people doing the same job to be paid differently just because of their age, something we have ended by negotiation with employers in our major agreements, and it has always been wrong that law allows pay discrimination by age.</p> <p>“We also very much welcome adding the cost of living to the Low Pay Commission’s remit. The current remit of looking at average earnings is too narrow, particularly in terms of the so-called ‘national living wage’. A genuine living wage must surely reflect the cost of living. With average wages stagnating over the last 10 years, this has impacted growth in minimum wage rates, leaving the lowest-paid struggling to make ends meet.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/18/texas-police-christopher-shaw-civil-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T14:59:32Z","webTitle":"Black man left paralyzed after Texas police allegedly slam him on to concrete","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/texas-police-christopher-shaw-civil-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/texas-police-christopher-shaw-civil-rights","fields":{"headline":"Black man left paralyzed after Texas police allegedly slam him on to concrete","trailText":"Civil rights activists and Christopher Shaw’s lawyers are demanding justice after he was severely injured while in police custody in 2021","byline":"Maya Yang","body":"<p>Lawyers of a Black Texas man and civil rights activists are calling for justice after he was allegedly grabbed and slammed on to concrete ground by police officers at a jail in Beaumont, Texas, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/boston-police-chasing-white-suspect-wrongly-arrested-black-man-lawsuit-says\">US officer pursuing white suspect held knee on Black man’s neck, lawsuit says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wednesday, lawyers of 41-year-old Christopher Shaw hosted a press conference that called for justice for Shaw, who was severely injured while in custody in June 2021.</p> <p>According to a lawsuit filed last month, Shaw was arrested on 12 June 2021 over misdemeanor public intoxication charges after Beaumont police officer James Gillen found him standing in the middle of a roadway, “in need of medical assistance”. Shaw was then taken to a hospital to be evaluated before being transported to Jefferson county correctional facility in Beaumont, where he was restrained for “noncompliance”.</p> <p>“Before entering the facility, Mr Shaw slightly turned his body. Defendant Gillen responded by attempting to slam Mr Shaw to the concrete platform at the rear entrance of the facility,” the lawsuit <a href=\"https://unicourt.com/case/pc-db5-shaw-v-gillen-et-al-1241306\">said</a>.</p> <p>He landed on his head and fractured his spine in multiple places, the lawsuit alleges. Shaw asked for help from jail staff and employees of the jail’s medical contractor, CorrHealth, but they refused to help him, according to the lawsuit. When Shaw asked one nurse for assistance, she allegedly told him, “I won’t help you until you help yourself.”</p> <p>The lawsuit added that Shaw was left alone in his jail cell for approximately 20 hours before someone attended to him medically. While he was left alone in his cell, he “defecated and urinated on himself multiple times due to his inability to control his bowels and kidney function”, the lawsuit said. Only later was an ambulance called for him and he was taken to the hospital again, where he underwent various emergency surgeries.</p> <p>Upon coming back to jail from the hospital, “Mr Shaw clearly showed signs of paralysis. Specifically, Mr Shaw was not ambulant. Mr Shaw was placed in a wheelchair and, with the assistance of another officer, Mr Shaw was wheeled back into JCCF. Mr Shaw was unable to control his lower extremities,” the lawsuit said.</p> <p>Shaw has since filed the lawsuit against police officer James Gillen, the city of Beaumont and CorrHealth.</p> <p>During Wednesday’s press conference, Candice Matthews, the statewide steering committee chair for the Rev Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Push Coalition, said, “We’re dealing with America’s chaos. And from police brutality, that is exactly what we’re dealing with. We’re dealing with road cops that operate on ignorance and authority. And that is a dangerous combination because the end result is what has happened to dear brother Christopher Shaw.</p> <p>“We’re dealing with lack of accountability because accountability breeds responsibility. And therefore we need our law enforcement to be responsible enough to hold their officers accountable when wrongdoing has been done,” she added.</p> <p>Speaking to<a href=\"https://www.12newsnow.com/article/news/local/federal-lawsuit-paralyzed-beaumont-police-officer/502-1f684adc-237c-49b6-bca5-87e0954c1cc5\"> KBMT</a> last September, the Beaumont police chief, James Singletary, said that although he felt “very badly about the gentleman that got injured”, Gillen was “just doing his job”.</p> <p>The incident was captured on video which Shaw’s attorneys have seen, but according to Beaumont officials, public release of the video is prohibited as it may jeopardize jail security. Shaw’s attorney and civil rights advocate said they are working to release the video.</p> <p>On Thursday, the bishop and social activist William Barber II, of the non-profit organization Repairers of the Breach, called for the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, to release the video.</p> <p>“Today we are asking and demanding that Governor Abbott demand the release of the video and any other politician that cares about justice, that are running for office, should be demanding the release of the video,” Barber said at a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/brepairers/videos/602049071465264\">press conference</a>.</p> <p>“This case is about investigating a pattern and practice … what made the officer think he could do this in the first damn place?</p> <p>“We must have a full and thorough investigation, not only here … but also the [US] Department of Justice to ensure that anyone can be safe … and even if you are arrested, an arrest is not a death sentence or a license to maim.”</p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/19/the-fiver-casemiro-manchester-united-crisis-baton-rubbernecking","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T14:56:13Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Casemiro, Manchester United and crisis-baton rubbernecking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/the-fiver-casemiro-manchester-united-crisis-baton-rubbernecking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/19/the-fiver-casemiro-manchester-united-crisis-baton-rubbernecking","fields":{"headline":"Casemiro, Manchester United and crisis-baton rubbernecking","trailText":"<strong>In today’s Fiver:</strong> Casemiro, getting riled by the wireless and wash-out woes","byline":"Scott Murray","body":"<h2><strong>CASEMIRO: INSTANT HERO?</strong></h2> <p>Got to be honest, the weekend Premier League fixtures aren’t the most fascinating. Leicester versus Southampton offers the vague promise of some crisis-baton rubbernecking, Brentford’s trip to Fulham has the potential to be the most polite local derby in Premier League history, and if New Arsenal are planning on revealing themselves as Old Spurs, then Bournemouth is the very place for all those box-fresh hopes of progress to crumble to dust. As for Newcastle United’s chances of taking anything from Manchester City, we point you in the direction of Eddie Howe’s record against the Citizens of 12 matches played, 12 losses, five goals scored, 39 against, and all without facing Erling Haaland. God speed the Foxes, Saints, Gunners and especially the Toon, but very little of it screams jaw-dropping, eye-popping, interesting-first-paragraph-inspiring action.</p> <p>To be fair, it doesn’t help that the one choice match-up of the weekend isn’t actually slated for the weekend. Manchester United host Liverpool on Monday evening, and while this rivalry normally disappoints, rarely living up to expectations, nobody ever learns, least of all us, and the anticipation before the big one is real. Not least because both teams have suffered a cold start to their Premier League campaign, Liverpool with two draws, United two humiliations. Something’s got to give, and here’s absolutely categorically hoping the desperation doesn’t lead to a big comic-book cloud of dust with boots and fists sticking out of it. The Fiver will settle for a few goals. But the OOYAH OOF cloud of dust, no, we wouldn’t like, etc.</p> <p>United will be desperate to avenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/24/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">the 5-0 reverse</a> inflicted upon them at Old Trafford by Liverpool last season, the low/high point being the bizarro LS Lowry tableau of thousands of punters streaming out of the ground with barely an hour gone. Things are different now, and they may try to use tactics this time, setting themselves out in some sort of shape and trying to maintain it. However, the player registration deadline having passed at midday on Friday, they’ll be unable to field likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/carlo-ancelotti-confirms-casemiro-will-move-to-manchester-united\">new signing Casemiro</a>, who did a number on Liverpool in this year’s Big Cup final and who has told Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti that “he wants to try a new challenge … he wants to leave … we didn’t try to convince him to stay.” Whether that should serve as any sort of red flag to United remains to be seen, but it barely needs saying that the intense 30-year-old Brazilian represents a serious upgrade on McFred, all on his own. As such, while the reported £50.7m transfer fee and £££squillions weekly stipend may raise an eyebrow, the way things are at the minute he’s cheap at twice the price.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“It was obviously not a nice week for [Manchester] United after the Brentford game.

I decided to drown my sorrows in town at my hotel, only to have the entire Liverpool team rock in for beers. As an Evertonian, this wasn’t an ideal situation. Thankfully everyone was throughly entertained by Newcastle hammering Manchester United 5-0 on the box. I gave my ticket to the barman who was also a Blue for the rearranged fixture, as I couldn’t make it. Things got very merry/messy” – Ian Taylor.</p> <p>“My wife and I set off to watch Reading’s first game of the 2012-13 season at Sunderland, full of the optimism you know is likely to be dashed shortly after kick-off. Unfortunately it didn’t last that long – the game was postponed after a minor shower just over an hour beforehand. After a 500-mile, 10-hour round trip simply to eat a burger, when we recall the story with friends now, we’re accused of telling a Whopper” – Alan Giles.</p> <p>“Clara’s note reminded me of my first abandoned game: an FA Vase match at Culverden Stadium between Tunbridge Wells and Camberley in the mid-to-late-1980s. I think it was a December or January game – so in the ‘proper’ rounds – where extra-time was played ahead of any replay. Alas, a lack of floodlights – and a kick-off time that didn’t factor in extra-time – forced an abandonment on 105 minutes with the score 5-5. Great fun but ultimately meaningless” – Ian Sargeant [<a href=\"https://fchd.info/cups/favase1985-86.htm\">1985-86, we think</a> … Camberley won the replay 3-1 – Fiver Ed].</p> <p>“My tale of wash-out woe was as a player. After some years of sweating and grunting in lower grades for my university club in the flamin’ Canberra leagues of the 1980s, I was finally selected to play … cue fanfare … in the first grade. My first professional match was scheduled in the ‘local’ town of Griffith, NSW, a mere 360km and more than four hours’ bus trip away. While we first-graders sat in the stand to watch my presumably skill-challenged ex-teammates in the second grade hoof it about for 90 minutes, a series of ominous clouds and thundery grumbles swirled around the ground, which, with a notable lack of foresight, had been constructed within a natural depression. Just as we warmed up the sky went black, the heavens cracked and a proverbial bucket was emptied upon the scene. After 10 minutes there was a foot of water on the pitch/pond. Match off, a couple of beers and a slow coach home. The following week some absent first-teamers had returned and I was not selected again. There may be a moral in there somewhere but I’m yet to spot it” – Mick O’Regan.</p> <p>Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com?utm_term=74a748e4b8e110828c18f39d5a2b0182&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email&amp;utm_term=55272aa72d2eb1611c2c7da0d82ff8f9&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email&amp;utm_term=1b24df1f5360eaff87d33d10ad52d105&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-landmark-healthcare-climate-bill\">‘Biggest step forward on climate ever’: Biden signs Democrats’ landmark bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/podcasts\">to Politico</a>, Klain said: “The president has delivered the largest economic recovery plan since Roosevelt, the largest infrastructure plan since [Dwight D] Eisenhower, the most judges confirmed since Kennedy, the second-largest healthcare bill since Johnson, and the largest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-landmark-healthcare-climate-bill\">climate change bill</a> in history.”</p> <p>Klain’s comments, aimed at voters contemplating the midterm elections, are an indication that Democrats plan to campaign heavily on their accomplishments in the less than two years they have been in power. He also pointed to “the first time we’ve done gun control since President Clinton was here, the first time ever an African American woman [Ketanji Brown Jackson] has been put on the US supreme court.</p> <p>“I think it’s a record to take to the American people.”</p> <p>Klain’s references to historical figures chimes with Biden’s own interests. The president has regularly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/10/biden-us-historians-democracy-threat/\">consulted historians</a>, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2021/03/25/biden-historians-meeting-filibuster\">among them</a> Doris Kearns Goodwin, Michael Beschloss and Eddie Glaude Jr, while Jon Meacham, a biographer of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and George HW Bush, has been a close adviser in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/the-historian-jon-meacham-who-wrote-of-the-soul-of-america-has-been-working-on-bidens-speeches.html\">shaping</a> Biden’s effort to restore “the soul of the nation” after the presidency of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Democrats control Congress by narrow margins. Opposition parties commonly do well in the first elections of a presidential term, and Republicans remain favoured to take control of one or both chambers. But legislative successes, most recently the passage of a major domestic and climate crisis spending plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-landmark-healthcare-climate-bill\">the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, have given Democrats hope.</p> <p>One senator, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, pointed to the need to communicate better, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/1559649238220300289?s=21&amp;t=f-GJjOTMP77IZv_lLY0FZg\">writing</a>: “I feel like the media is having a hard time metabolising the fact that this Congress has been historically productive. And acknowledging the size of these accomplishments, and the degree of difficultly – it’s just hard to do accurately without sounding a bit left-leaning.”</p> <p>There is some indication that Democrats are becoming more popular. They have established polling leads in key Senate races including Arizona, Pennsylvania and Ohio, against Trump-endorsed Republicans who are struggling to attract moderates and independents.</p> <p>In Kentucky on Thursday, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, seemed to downplay expectations. McConnell <a href=\"https://nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/mcconnell-says-republicans-may-not-win-senate-control-citing-candidate-rcna43777\">said</a>: “I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different – they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.</p> <p>“Right now, we have a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 country, but I think when all is said and done this fall, we’re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly.”</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/\">Politico</a> interview, Klain said: “Elections are choices, and the choice just couldn’t be any clearer right now.</p> <p>“Democrats have stood up to the big special interests. They stood up to the big corporations and insisted that all corporations pay minimum taxes, stood up to the big oil companies and passed climate change legislation. They stood up to Big Pharma and passed prescription drug legislation. They stood up to the gun industry and passed gun control legislation.</p> <p>“Things that [Washington DC was] unable to deliver on for decades because the special interests had things locked down, Joe Biden and his allies in Congress have been able to deliver on.”</p> <p>Asked about the Republican counter-offer, he cited issues Democrats hope can galvanise voters, prominently including attacks on abortion access after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the ruling which protected the right.</p> <p>“We have an extreme Maga group in the Republican party that has no real plan to bring down inflation,” Klain said, referring to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again. “They obviously want to pass a nationwide ban on abortion. They sided with big pharma. They sided with the climate deniers … most of them sided with the gun lobby.</p> <p>“And so I think that choice [is] between a party that’s standing up to the special interests and delivering change and … an extreme party, a party that’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/rick-scott-republican-senator-tax-rises-plan\">talking about</a> … abolishing social security and Medicare every five years.</p> <p>“The extreme nature of our opponents, whether it’s with regard to democracy or social security, are all part of a movement that is just very different than we’ve seen in recent years in this country.”</p> <p>Klain said the worst day of the presidency was 26 August 2021, when 13 US service members were killed by a suicide bomb during the evacuation of Kabul.</p> <p>That, he said, was “just a terrible tragedy and certainly the darkest day”.</p> <p>Questions have been raised, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/carolyn-maloney-biden-2024-election-apology\">including by Democrats</a>, about whether Biden is too old to run for a second term. Klain said Biden’s experience – he will turn 80 in November – helped make him an effective leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/trump-redacted-affidavit-release-mar-a-lago-fbi-search\">Judge orders DoJ to prepare redacted Trump search affidavit for possible release</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden, he said, has “a personal history of tremendous, joyous successes and devastating tragedies. And I think that helps moderate his spirit at all times.</p> <p>“There is nothing I can ever walk into the Oval Office and tell him that’s any bigger than the bigger things he’s already experienced in life. And nothing I could ever tell him is any sadder than the saddest things he’s already experienced in life.

That, quite clearly, was another case of the two-weight champion throwing those in front of him off guard.</p> <p>Joshua, meanwhile, came in at 244.5lb, four-and-a-half pounds heavier than he was last year, not a huge difference but nevertheless a sign that, unlike Usyk, he intends to stick to his mooted pre-fight plan of leaning into his superior size and weight, as well as generally being more aggressive, as he seeks to become heavyweight world champion for a third time, joining a group of fighters that includes Muhammad Ali and Lennox Lewis.</p> <p>“I’m looking forward to the fight,” said Joshua at Friday’s weigh-in. “And I’m ready for 12 rounds.” Joshua’s strategy is clear – charge forward from the first bell and look to push his hulking, towering frame over his smaller opponent. He will hope that will provide him with the foundations to dictate proceedings and land the shots – or one big shot – that results in a 25th victory as a professional.</p> <p>That will be easier said than done against such a skilled and resilient opponent as Usyk, however. Quite simply the 35-year-old knows how to adapt to any situation and he will be confident he can stand up to Joshua’s storm despite the increased disparity in their weights and, again, flummox him with his sublime movement and technical traits. He will also trust that Joshua’s renowned lack of stamina will deny him the ability to go the distance, despite what the 32-year-old insisted on Friday.</p> <p>Usyk is also not lacking in motivation having begun his preparations for this fight on the back of serving in Ukraine’s army as part of the country’s defence against Russia’s invasion. It was a harrowing experience and Usyk’s overriding desire this weekend is to secure a victory that will provide his country with much-needed joy. To that end, he has also ensured the fight will be broadcast free-to-air in Ukraine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e2a1169357468d56f45c83dfbafdd08ecd509e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2a1169357468d56f45c83dfbafdd08ecd509e2/0_144_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Hearn watches on as Oleksandr Usyk and Anthony Joshua stare off during the weigh-in\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Promoter Eddie Hearn watches on as Oleksandr Usyk and Anthony Joshua stare off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khalid Alhaj/MB Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is a heartwarming turn of events but for many does not detract from this fight’s staging in Jeddah being part of a sportswashing campaign orchestrated by Saudi Arabia in order to shift attention from the kingdom’s human rights record. “It’s clear that Riyadh’s calculation is sport is going to gradually relax people talking about executions, jailing, murdering of journalists and bombing in Yemen,” said Felix Jakens, head of priority campaigns at Amnesty international.</p> <p>Amnesty has called on Joshua and Usyk to condemn Saudi Arabia, and while the former has insisted to the Guardian that he does not “condone human rights abuses”, he has also said he is principally “here for boxing” to reclaim his heavyweight titles on his return to Saudi Arabia three years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/07/anthony-joshua-goes-distance-win-world-titles-andy-ruiz-jr-points-unanimous-decision-boxing\" title=\"\">stopping Andy Ruiz Jr</a> in Diriyah.</p> <p>He and Usyk are also here for the payday and that, in truth, is why this fight is taking place in the Middle East, with each fighter expected to receive a minimum purse of £33m, far more than they would have got had they met elsewhere. As ever in boxing, money talks.</p> <p>Regardless, there is no denying the intrigue attached to the fight ahead. For Joshua, in particular, it could prove career-defining, either propelling him into the history books as well as back to the very top of his division, or, as has been suggested, with nowhere to go except retirement. The stakes could not be much higher.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/19/california-murders-dna-horace-van-vaultz-killings","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T14:49:19Z","webTitle":"California man found guilty of two 1980s murders thanks to new DNA technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/19/california-murders-dna-horace-van-vaultz-killings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/19/california-murders-dna-horace-van-vaultz-killings","fields":{"headline":"California man found guilty of two 1980s murders thanks to new DNA technology","trailText":"In 2006 detectives discovered DNA evidence, but it was 12 more years before they could identify suspect using genealogy websites","byline":"Richard Luscombe","body":"<p>Prosecutors in California secured the conviction of a 1980s double murderer after the first use by Los Angeles county detectives of online genealogical databases to identify a suspect.</p> <p>Horace Van Vaultz, now 67, killed Selena Keough, 20, in Montclair in 1981, and Mary Duggan, 22, in Burbank in 1986, but escaped justice for 36 years until investigators were able to link him to DNA from the victims.</p> <p>“Using the latest in technology and forensics, we were able to secure a conviction against someone who targeted young women,” said the Los Angeles county district attorney, George Gascón.</p> <p>“I hope that today’s guilty verdict provides some comfort to the victims’ families who have waited more than three decades to see this result.”</p> <p>Gascón said agents from the FBI forensic genetic genealogy team assisted the inquiry.</p> <p>In 2006, detectives discovered that a DNA profile from Duggan’s murder uploaded to a law enforcement database matched one from Keough’s.</p> <p>But it was another 12 years, following advances in technology, before detectives could identify a suspect, using genealogy websites in a search for relatives of the perpetrator.</p> <p>A Burbank police department detective, Aaron Kay, <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/mystery-photos-found-at-accused-serial-killers-home-horace-van-vaultz/2323819/\">told NBC Los Angeles</a> in 2020 that the capture of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/21/golden-state-killer-joseph-deangelo-to-be-sentenced-to-life-in-prison\">Golden State Killer</a> two years earlier was inspirational.</p> <p>“That was big news, because now there was a different way of using the suspect’s DNA to try to identify him,” he said.</p> <p>The search began in law enforcement DNA files, then in genealogical data online.

The content might not have the insights you want, or it may not even seem like it was created for, or even by, a person.”</p> <p>So-called “SEO spam”, content written explicitly for the purposes of appearing high up on the results pages of search engines, has long been a thorn in the side of companies like Google. To tackle it, the company is launching a “helpful content update” next week.</p> <p>The update covers a number of tweaks to the company’s ranking algorithms that attempt to identify content “that seems to have been primarily created for ranking well in search engines rather than to help or inform people”. Google says that, in tests, the update has resulted in particular improvements for searches related to online education, arts and entertainment, shopping and technology.</p> <p>In one example, Sullivan says, a search about a recent movie can sometimes bring up articles that simply aggregate reviews from other sites; now, “you’ll see more results with unique, authentic information, so you’re more likely to read something you haven’t seen before”.</p> <p>There are winners and losers from such changes, of course, and online publishers may fear that their content strategies will see them caught up in the net. In its advice for “content creators”, Google implies that some of the signals it will use to downgrade search results are whether or not a website has a primary purpose or focus, and whether there is “an existing or intended audience” that would find the content useful if they came directly to the page.</p> <p>The “banhammer” will be wielded liberally. “Any content – not just unhelpful content – on sites determined to have relatively high amounts of unhelpful content overall is less likely to perform well in search, assuming there is other content elsewhere from the web that’s better to display,” Google says. “For this reason, removing unhelpful content could help the rankings of your other content.”</p> <p>In recent months, Google has launched a concerted effort to fight perceptions that the company’s search products have grown worse over time. Headlines like “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90673924/its-not-just-you-google-search-really-is-getting-worse\">It’s not just you, Google search really is getting worse</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/business/opinion/2022/02/19/google-search-has-gotten-worse-heres-the-trick-people-have-found-to-get-around-it.html\">Google search has gotten worse.

She said the government would continue to address the issue of island depopulation, with an action plan due in 2023.</p> <p>Scotland has more than 90 inhabited islands, where communities face challenges of population ageing and decline, as well as housing pressures.

The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has talked of the outlook for food prices as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/apocalyptic-food-prices-will-be-disastrous-for-worlds-poor-says-bank-governor\">“apocalyptic”</a>, while radio phone-in hosts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e7b8656-24c8-4254-be38-a3db70ea7413\">say their callers</a> now sound desperate.</p> <p>Amid all this, Westminster has gone awol. As inflation this week hit a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-inflation-rise-petrol-diesel-prices\">40-year high</a>, the prime minister was sunning himself on a Greek island. Keir Starmer has spent months scraping together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/labour-to-push-energy-price-cap-policy-in-campaign-blitz\">half a policy</a> on gas and electricity bills, which is effectively a backstop for the big six energy firms. Meanwhile, daily life for millions of people is rapidly becoming unaffordable. Rents are shooting up, petrol remains high and, as Deana and her neighbours know, food prices are rocketing.</p> <p>Over at the offices of the local Senedd member, Jack Sargeant, they’ve noticed a big change in the volume and type of requests for help they’re getting. The usual targeted emails from familiar constituents are being replaced by Facebook messages sent by those who’ve never before got in touch.</p> <p>“They’re vague, because they don’t know what to ask for – just that their mum needs help or their neighbour’s in a bad way,” says staffer Ed Stubbs. “And next week we’ll get more, as parents start thinking about school uniforms.”</p> <p>When some country in Africa is hit by a humanitarian emergency, the impeccably coiffed TV correspondents point out how long it has been teetering on the brink of disaster. What will they say here in their potted histories? In Shotton you might <a href=\"https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/events-north-wales-shotton-steelworks-14935801\">start the story</a> in March 1980, when the giant steelworks shut and 6,500 locals were slung out of work in one day – at that time the largest industrial redundancy in western Europe. A much smaller plant today finishes steel that comes out of Port Talbot, while a couple of miles away is the real indicator of Shotton’s present-day fortunes: an Amazon warehouse. Together with shops and food factories, it makes up a big chunk of the local labour market. For everyone else, there is universal credit and the kind of low-income ducking and diving that statisticians classify as self-employment. And I mean low income: in parts of this town,<a href=\"https://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/15928034.almost-one-four-children-across-wrexham-flintshire-living-poverty/\"> almost half</a> of the kids are growing up in poverty.</p> <p>Most of the UK is richer than Shotton, but our national story is not dissimilar. We have gone from the deindustrialisation of the 70s and 80s to the financial bubbles of Tony Blair to the austerity of David Cameron and Theresa May. Whether Tory or Labour, our political classes have lurched from crisis to crisis while feeding us a diet of lies and shoddy alibis.</p> <p>Thatcher promised national rebirth, New Labour a knowledge economy, George Osborne a march of the makers, and Boris Johnson levelling up. None delivered. All the while, our institutions have been razed and our social fabric torn up, leaving us with little protection from the crisis just about to hit us. In four decades, we have gone from secure jobs to benefits to food banks – and now, as my colleague Josh Halliday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/22/liverpool-food-banks-confront-rising-hunger\">reported from Liverpool </a>last month, the food banks are running out of food to give.</p> <p>Food banks began in the UK as a stopgap, yet donated tins and leftover bread have become a part of our welfare state. As Robbie Davison, who runs Well Fed, says: “It’s not food that people would choose for themselves. It’s a model that says, ‘We know you’re poor, and this’ll do.’ That’s right wing.” I have previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/15/man-feeds-hungry-kids-hates-food-banks-austerity\">written about Davison </a>and his alternative model of getting good food to everyone, regardless of their income. His business squeezes its profit margins to do meals on wheels and generous ready meals at £2 a pop, and he lobbies for councils and others to get on board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e1721dde49c17f6c2241e13374164d3fedfad11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e1721dde49c17f6c2241e13374164d3fedfad11/0_39_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Karl Shearon prepares meals for Well Fed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chef Karl Shearon prepares meals for Well Fed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the local housing association, Clwyd Alyn, they now provide Well Fed’s lunches for free to all staff. The scheme began this spring after the chief executive, Clare Budden, noticed that some employees weren’t eating at work, while others were taking a lot of overtime to get by. Already paying in line with the market, Budden’s team concluded that another salary rise would get part-taxed away. Free lunches on the other hand can save full-time employees about £100 a month. When I met Budden at Davison’s kitchens, she had brought along Robin Rolfe, one of her guys in IT who noted that meal breaks were now more social than a sad sandwich eaten at a desk.</p> <p>It was a rare moment of cheer before their thoughts turned back to the months ahead. Rolfe talked of starving his family’s pre-pay meter of money.<strong> </strong>Budden has plans to give out hot-water bottles and blankets to her housing association tenants. “I worry about some of our tenants not getting through the winter because they’re not going to put the heating on.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/350-cost-of-living-payment-what-happens-winter-heat-or-eat\">I got a £350 cost of living payment. What happens after that? It’s hardly going to get me through the winter | Liz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is wartime, in a modern age,” says Davison. “All the lights will be on in the city centres, we’ll still have all the trappings …” Budden laughs: “We’ll still have the John Lewis ad and it [will make] us all cry and want to spend money we don’t have.”</p> <p>And on an estate on the other side of Shotton the signs will still warn against ballgames being played on the grass, and for pet owners to pick up after their dogs. But God alone knows what will happen to the families inside those small homes.</p> <ul> <li><p>Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/19/erik-ten-hag-defends-glazers-manchester-united-ownership","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T14:21:05Z","webTitle":"‘They want to win’: Erik ten Hag defends Glazers’ Manchester United ownership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/erik-ten-hag-defends-glazers-manchester-united-ownership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/19/erik-ten-hag-defends-glazers-manchester-united-ownership","fields":{"headline":"‘They want to win’: Erik ten Hag defends Glazers’ Manchester United ownership","trailText":"The United manager wants club and fans ‘to fight together and be unified’ while fan group the 1958 plan protests before Monday’s match against Liverpool","byline":"Jamie Jackson","body":"<p>Erik ten Hag has defended the Glazers by stating that Manchester United’s owners “want to win” before expected protests against the American family’s ownership in the runup to Monday’s visit of Liverpool.</p> <p>Fan group the 1958 has stated it will stage new action to show the discontent regarding the Glazers 17-year proprietorship, with a march that may involve several hundred and is planned to end at 7.30pm on Monday opposite the club store.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/carlo-ancelotti-confirms-casemiro-will-move-to-manchester-united\">Carlo Ancelotti confirms Casemiro will leave Madrid for Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The manager was asked about this. “I can only say the owners want to win and the fans – we want them behind the club,” said Ten Hag. “I can understand sometimes [the sentiment] but I am not that long in the club to see all the backgrounds.

That will be worth an additional average of £2,300 on the workers’ salaries, equal to an extra £55 per week, Unite said.

TV series, it seems, keep turning into movies. They’re probably not patient zero, but the showrunners of Game of Thrones are undoubtedly superspreaders for this current wave, having ignited controversy by describing their show as “a 73-hour movie” <a href=\"https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sxsw/2017-03-12/sxsw-panel-game-of-thrones-showrunners/\">back in 2017</a>. Soon, the TV landscape was swarming with series rebranded as films of varying yet uniformly hefty length. The idiom was repurposed frequently enough to reach “bane of all existence” status for TV critics, and to inspire a Shouts and Murmurs piece in the New Yorker. Now, to quote a show that ignited a powder keg of debate over the difference between cinema and television not so long ago, “It is happening again.”</p> <p>Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, co-creators of the upcoming Addams Family reboot Wednesday for Netflix, uttered the magic words in <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/08/addams-family-first-look-wednesday\">an interview with Vanity Fair earlier this week</a>, stating that “the ambition of the show was to make it an eight-hour Tim Burton movie.” (Burton is on board as executive producer and director for four of the eight episodes.) They’ve dusted off the old soundbite during a period of increased critique for it, with The Boys head honcho Eric Kripke having <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/the-boys-eric-kripke-season-3-finale-interview.html\">recently thrown down the gauntlet on the matter</a>. Of TV directors who claim to have conceived their series as a manner of movie, he said: “Fuck you! No you’re not! Make a TV show. You’re in the entertainment business.” In Olivier Assayas’s new miniseries reimagining his 1996 showbiz satire Irma Vep, the director of the show within the show invokes the “eight-hour movie” adage in an interview as if to poke fun at the phrase’s inescapability. Speaking with me at Cannes earlier this year, he confirmed that he doesn’t share the mindset, and that this line shares the soupçon of caricature accenting the rest of the series.</p> <p>To understand the cause for all the fuss originating from a seemingly matter-of-fact figure of speech requires an awareness of the connotations and biases tacitly coded in the TV-to-movie pivot. When the makers of TV liken their work to a movie, they’re inviting a host of associations set by the praise for 00s classics like The Sopranos or The Wire that emphasized their “cinematic” qualities: ambition of scale, long-game storytelling, technical sophistication with the camera. When writers made this comparison, it scanned as insight; coming from the mouths of directors, it sounds more like image control, a broader assurance that the series in question is accomplished enough to stand comparison to the big boys of the silver screen. It’s a method of pre-emptively classing up the joint, and of distancing TV from a perceived dinkiness seen as inseparable from the character of the medium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"864a9b54dfc508c0bd4baedc2ab7049e2f3abf4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/864a9b54dfc508c0bd4baedc2ab7049e2f3abf4b/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Irma Vep.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Irma Vep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so one starts to see the condescension in this line of thinking that alienates anybody invested in respect and appreciation for TV. Even if the “X-hour movie” line hadn’t been used as an excuse for plodding episode-by-episode plotting with flagrant disregard for the subtle art of pacing, it would still be fundamentally inaccurate. Using one entire season to tell an overarching story broken up into segments isn’t fitting cinema into the mold of TV, but the very definition of TV itself. Those writers subscribing to that flawed philosophy haven’t rejected serialization, just resolved to be bad at it. Every great TV show has found a way to tell stories contained within the space of an episode that nonetheless coalesce into a larger narrative structure. Streaming allows us to eliminate the time between installments, and too many have taken that as implicit permission to abandon the building blocks of the art.</p> <p>The quasi-meme of the “X-hour movie” betrays a confused idea about dignity and creative validity, as inferiority-complexed directors imagine they’ll be taken more seriously if they cast their lot with the cinema. (Note that the franchise managers of the Marvel Cinematic Universe hesitate to bill their product as being like a TV show, even as they force serial storytelling and drain the polished grandeur from cinema.) This amounts to a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy, in that TV will never gain in stature until those making it wear their format with pride. Everyone would do well to embrace the qualities unique to their chosen field as advantages to be worked with, not limitations to be overcome. Until they do, there’s a simple way to expose the absurdity of TV wrapping itself in film’s clothing: next time you hear someone puff up a show’s air of prestige in this way, instead picture the most embarrassing, amateurish, contemptible movie you’ve ever seen. (I like to go with The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure.) Let its example be a lesson – that words have meanings, that form cannot be synonymous with quality, and that there are far worse things to be than TV.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/kleo-review-netflix-german-killing-eve","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T14:00:13Z","webTitle":"Kleo review – this cinematic assassin thriller is like a German Killing Eve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/kleo-review-netflix-german-killing-eve","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/kleo-review-netflix-german-killing-eve","fields":{"headline":"Kleo review – this cinematic assassin thriller is like a German Killing Eve","trailText":"This highly stylised, 80s/90s-set revenge drama about a Villanelle-esque Stasi killer might not be the most original, but it’s a rollicking adventure through cold war-era Berlin","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","body":"<p>Anyone still mourning the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/killing-eve\">Killing Eve</a> may find macabre comfort in Kleo (Netflix), an intriguing assassin revenge thriller from Germany with a Villanelle-style preference for violence with a strong aesthetic.

It is high-energy, breathlessly gruesome and early proof that Kleo is incredibly efficient at what she does, which is ruthlessly getting rid of whomever the state tells her is next. “The Wall will come down before she screws up,” says one character, not so much dropping a trail of breadcrumbs for the viewer as leaving the entire loaf behind.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd3k7BOlJpE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zd3k7BOlJpE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The eternal problem of finding a satisfying work/life balance is a little trickier when the work part is tied up in murder and espionage.

As Kleo is a revenge thriller, however, there has to be something to avenge in the first place, so naturally it all goes spectacularly and horribly wrong.</p> <p>There are devastating betrayals and losses that nix any lingering idea that the cartoonishness of Kleo’s world means this will somehow end up being a dark comedy. Though it has rare moments of humour it is mostly very bleak and very violent, and what happens to Kleo to create her raging desire for vengeance is truly grim.</p> <p>The Wall does come down, of course, but Kleo has made her mistake already. During that last job, she was chatted up at the bar by Sven, who turns out to have been an undercover police officer from the west, and eagle-eyed enough to catch the glint of a blade beneath her dress. Sven is a goofy outsider who cannot muster the respect of his colleagues and is often relegated to paperwork, but he fixates on tracking down this ghost of a woman. His story is the other half of the series, and though they are from different worlds in every respect, he and Kleo are brought together to discover they are more similar than they might think.</p> <p>It all rollicks along at a satisfying speed, with the political upheaval of the late 1980s and early 90s proving a gripping backdrop for its cat-and-mouse games. The supporting characters are fun, particularly Thilo, a techno-loving western squatter, sort of, who ends up as Kleo’s reluctant friend and companion. The characters’ various loyalties, earned and misplaced, are nicely complicated. (Kleo won’t fly Air Berlin, for example, because it’s an American company.) It looks fantastic, particularly if you’re into clashing floral wallpapers – in which case, this might be your idea of interior design heaven. So long as you can ignore the blood stains, that is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03f2e78225fb42393e444b1185655c232c6f9c3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03f2e78225fb42393e444b1185655c232c6f9c3c/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tunnel vision … Kleo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tunnel vision … Kleo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Terjung/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Kleo wasn’t set where it is set, and when it is set, though, its lack of originality might stand out more. It starts with the old faux-disclaimer – “This is a true story. None of this really happened” – and many of its devices, from the mysterious suitcase stuffed in a locker to the “one last job” promise, will be familiar to anyone fond of a thriller or two. It is also stuffed with big, plot-driving coincidences. At one point, exactly the right file falls out of a huge pile of paperwork and a useful photograph falls out of that file, blowing the whole case wide open. It isn’t subtle.</p> <p>But the pairing of Kleo, who is broken, lost and desperate to find out what happened to her and why, with Sven, who is bumbling, dogged and obviously delighted that his life has taken such an exciting turn, is a smart one, and you spend a lot of the early episodes hoping they might get over their opposing interests to pull together against the real baddies. Kleo may not be the first to do it, but it is nevertheless an entertaining, highly stylised and cinematic adventure.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/19/muster-station-leith-review-edinburgh-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T14:00:13Z","webTitle":"Muster Station: Leith review – visceral vision of the looming apocalypse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/19/muster-station-leith-review-edinburgh-2022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/19/muster-station-leith-review-edinburgh-2022","fields":{"headline":"Muster Station: Leith review – visceral vision of the looming apocalypse","trailText":"The audience are cast as climate refugees in an immersive show that weaves together issues of class, power and politics","byline":"Mark Fisher","body":"<p>Climate campaigners have been sounding the alarm for decades, but only now the days are getting hot and the rivers are running dry have they had much impact.

There were a couple of hardy old campaigners but most of the crowd were probably not born in the club’s 1990s heyday or, if they were, they’d not have been rave-ready. There was a water station but most people were drinking green juice; there’s a limit to how much hydration you need, absent intoxication, when all you’re doing is dancing. You can never, conversely, have too much kale.</p> <p>I’d been there before, many times, but this was the first time I’d really observed the place, having previously been – to drop a technical, 1990s term – mashed off my tits. The dancing was very determined, and efficient, like an exercise class. The people were very taut and well groomed, what we used to call hardbodies (we didn’t mean that as a compliment). There was a lot of face-glitter, which I always think is like an am-dram performance of fun, rather than actual fun.

So let’s park the specifics and keep this very general: it’s important to sometimes make the bad choices; to do things so regrettable that you’re still laughing in shame 30 years later. The reason it’s important is not some nebulous one about letting your hair down, it’s very specific; you can make every good choice, practise self-care and sleep hygiene, exercise, meditate, reflect, feel grateful, eat clean, and things are still going to go wrong. Relationships will still break down, careers will still fail to launch, you’ll still be inside your own head. If you’re constantly striving to be your best self, the obvious solution is just to try harder. You’ll end up like a New Labour government of your own mind and body, constantly setting targets, measuring things, going back to recalibrate the key performance indicator, wondering why, when all the boxes have been ticked, the outcome has not been achieved – then going back to add more boxes.</p> <p>But a lot of the problems are external to you: your pay isn’t high enough because of your employer, not because your alignment is out of whack and it’s interfering with your hustle. Sure, hangovers give you anxiety, but so does rent. It’s reasonable to bring your serious minds to these serious times, but self-discipline is a lonely creed and solidarity is more fruitful.</p> <p>I think a lot about the intense hedonism of the long 1990s, and whether there’s a connection between that and generation X’s failure to make a political impact; all the gains we managed to let slip through our fingers; the sheer thinness of talent in the Cameron/Clegg/Miliband age bracket. I guess you guys could plausibly argue that not being drunk all the time has already made you more politically effective, more challenging, more radical, more searching. Realistically, though, the social fabric has been under sustained attack by late capitalism for the whole of this century, and I’m not sure that gen X drinking less snakebite would have made much difference.</p> <p>We’re going into a period of great material hardship, and nobody knows that better than gen Z: all the joy in life, all the beauty, is going to come from sex, fellowship, revolution and the life of the mind.

The question is about the intensity of the impact in particular areas.</p> <p><strong>Is there a magic number that is the tipping point from ‘nice to have visitors’ to crisis?</strong><br>I don’t think it’s as scientific as that. It’s about the feeling of the density and the withdrawal of services for local people. I’ll give you an example: there was a part of the high street in Edinburgh’s New Town where you could always get a paper. But, in 2019, the newsagent closed. It felt as if that part of town was not for locals any more. </p> <p><strong>Language preservation movements in Scotland, Cornwall and Wales have <a href=\"https://www.tivysideadvertiser.co.uk/news/18501128.housing-charter-demands-caps-holiday-homes-protect-local-communities/\" title=\"\">teamed up to tackle holiday lets</a> as </strong><strong>they are </strong><strong>having an impact on the number of speakers. There are many other negatives. What are the positives?</strong><br>The economic impacts. A home-sharing situation – ie a resident renting a spare room – has more positive impacts. You’ve got the direct financial benefit for the host, plus visitors going to restaurants and buying things in gift shops and therefore benefiting the community, and you’re not losing that house from the market. However, we found most short-term lets are for the whole house.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/can-i-catch-up-on-lost-sleep-we-ask-an-expert-coco-khan\">Can I catch up on lost sleep?

Painted by street artist Akse in October 2020, it was opened to mark World Mental Health Day and support Manchester Mind, Help Musicians and promote the 24/7 wellbeing text service Shout. In just under two years, it became part of the city’s identity, and led <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/joy-divisions-peter-hook-unveils-new-ian-curtis-mural-in-macclesfield-town-centre-3190982\">to a second Curtis mural in Macclesfield</a>.</p> <p>But on Wednesday morning, the city woke to the mural having been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/mural-of-joy-division-frontman-ian-curtis-painted-over-with-advert-aitch\">repainted with an advert for Manchester rapper Aitch’s new album</a>, Close to Home. The title was printed above a call-to-action to “listen to the album on Amazon Music”.</p> <p>Akse broke the news on social media. “So my mural of Ian Curtis based on the original photograph by @philippecarly has been painted over to promote the release of a new album,” he wrote on Instagram. “It had become a cultural landmark and meant so much to people from Manchester and beyond. It doesn’t take much common sense to understand that this mural should have remained for what it represented and stood for.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"08f38aff9218a6a33f7ef7778428f38edc87236c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08f38aff9218a6a33f7ef7778428f38edc87236c/1051_0_5504_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street artist Akse, in front of his mural of Ian Curtis in 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street artist Akse, in front of his mural of Ian Curtis in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kenny Brown/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had no prior warning, he tells the Guardian: “I was tagged in a story of the wall being repainted on Instagram. That’s how I found out. Having a temporary ad covering it made it worse.”</p> <p>Outcry soon followed from locals, musicians and fellow street artists. Curtis’s ex-bandmate Peter Hook responded to the post with a swearing emoji, Peaky Blinders director Anthony Byrne called for it to be “reinstated and left there permanently” and local group Manchester Music Forever shared that they were “absolutely disgusted”. Soon after, “Money Will Tear Us Apart” – a reference to Joy Division’s Love Will Tear Us Apart – was scrawled across the advert in red paint.</p> <p>Greater Manchester mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\">Andy Burnham</a> was also shocked. “Seriously, the idea of anybody getting a tin of paint and a paintbrush …” he tells the Guardian. “Who vaguely connected to Greater Manchester could think that it was possibly a good idea? It was sacrilegious, wasn’t it? It was awful.”</p> <p>Aitch was rapid to respond to the outrage, taking to social media to apologise for the replacement. “This is the first time I’ve heard of this,” he tweeted. “Me and my team are getting this fixed pronto,” he continued. “No way on Earth would I want to disrespect a local hero like Ian,” he continued, promising it would be repainted.</p> <p>The outpouring of anger highlights the cultural value that music murals hold, especially those that depict a beloved artist with ties to the local area. Burnham proudly talks about <a href=\"https://louderthanwar.com/mural-celebrating-pete-shelley-to-be-unveiled-in-leigh/\">a mural of Buzzcocks’ frontman Pete Shelley</a> in his old constituency: “It’s actually phenomenal – right in the middle of Leigh!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8a06d8f9426c088af4a04888114f89df7cf18525\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a06d8f9426c088af4a04888114f89df7cf18525/46_0_4723_5902/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rapper Aitch.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapper Aitch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kelvin Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Painting over a mural of this kind is an irreversible action; while it can be recreated, the original is lost forever and can become a cause for collective mourning. Many other murals have faced a similar reaction after their erasure. In 2013, <a href=\"https://evgrieve.com/2013/08/rip-joe-strummer-mural.html\">a Joe Strummer mural in New York’s East Village</a> was destroyed after 10 years, leading to local condemnation and a repainting. Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/2020/12/taylor-swift-nashville-mural-reactions\">Taylor Swift’s likeness was replaced by Brad Paisley</a> in a Nashville mural portraying a range of artists, leading to anger from her fans. <br><br>Last month, a mural of David Bowie in Sheffield, which admittedly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-35484297\">received ridicule when it was originally unveiled</a>, was <a href=\"https://www.thestar.co.uk/news/people/iconic-david-bowie-mural-in-sheffield-city-centre-stripped-off-by-conservationists-as-part-of-building-facelift-3779487\">stripped by construction workers</a>, leaving just bare brick behind. More recently, a tribute to Young Dolph – the Memphis rapper fatally shot last year – was <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/music/young-dolph-mural-memphis-defaced-artist-received-threats\">defaced just days before its unveiling</a>. The original artist received death threats, too, highlighting the political potency a music mural can convey.</p> <p>Street art is often not publicly condoned or cordoned off, leaving it vulnerable to vandalism or contracted repainting. Many music murals are commissioned as temporary installations, destined from the start to be replaced.</p> <p>Akse also makes a living from hand-painted advertisements – he recently worked with an agency that hired a wall on the other side of 75 Port Street who “decided not to go over the Ian Curtis wall as they knew it meant a lot to people”, he says. He doesn’t believe that anyone from Aitch’s team had bad intentions, and credits the rapper for “reaching out personally to get things fixed”.</p> <p>“I was saddened, of course, but not surprised or outraged,” says Philippe Carly, who knew the mural would have a limited lifespan. “I secretly hoped it would stay longer because of its impact. [It represented] Ian’s tragic fate, the importance and significance of mental issues and the paramount need to diagnose them and adequately address them.”</p> <p>Burnham agrees: “You get the same connection with Ian and the issues he was writing about from listening to his music, but also the mural in public in some ways is a help to people who might be going through [something] similar.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84ff31b3b44a003201c56503e765fbf121728ee1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ff31b3b44a003201c56503e765fbf121728ee1/694_31_2439_2302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘It makes us all wake up to the value of what we’ve got’ … the now blank wall on the side 75 Port Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"944\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It makes us all wake up to the value of what we’ve got’ … the now blank wall on the side of 75 Port Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The photograph, at least, endures decades after it was taken in Brussels in 1979. “This photo of Ian has a sort of supernatural impact,” says Carly. “Not that I give myself any credit for that. It has changed my life entirely and seems to affect viewers deeply.”</p> <p>A few days on, the wall remains vacant. Despite hasty efforts to erase the advert, the faded outline of “Tear Us Apart” is still visible. And the outrage has turned to optimism, uniting the people of Manchester through their previously unspoken appreciation for a piece of public art.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burnham is due to talk to city councillors Bev Craig and Pat Karney about the more general importance of preserving the city’s landmarks. “In a strange way, I think this will have a beneficial impact,” he says. “It makes us all wake up to the value of what we’ve got and prevents any repeat [incidents].”</p> <p>While no date has been set, Burnham confirms that the mural will be back for good. “The outcry means that it’ll be there for ever. We’re going to have to protect it … it’s going to go up and it’s going to be there for time in memoriam.”</p> <p>That said, it may not be on Port Street. “The main obstacle will probably be being able to find a suitable [long-term] wall,” says Akse. “Let’s see what happens.”</p> <p>• <em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

We simply will not get a London recovery unless TfL fires on all cylinders. What we don’t want are unreasonable, draconian strings attached by the government.”</p> <p>By contrast, Liz Truss, the favourite to become the new Conservative party leader and prime minister, said she would not let the UK be “held to ransom by militant trade unionists”.</p> <p>The TfL <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/\">website</a> showed services on the vast majority of tube lines were suspended, with a very limited operation elsewhere.</p> <p>There was also disruption to bus services in west and south-west London and parts of Surrey. This was the result of a strike on Friday and Saturday by London bus drivers who are members of Unite, in a separate dispute over pay. TfL said 63 bus routes were being affected.</p> <p>The strike action came as rail union leaders warned that a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions would continue “for as long as it takes”.</p> <p>However, a new survey suggested that only one in eight people have had their travel plans affected by rail strikes. According to the Office for National Statistics, 13% of adults questioned between 3 and 14 August said industrial action had disrupted their plans.</p> <p>Of those who said they had been affected, 4% said they had been unable to work, 4% had been unable to attend a medical appointment and 2% said they had been unable to care for friends or family.</p> <p>On Saturday, rail workers will strike again, which will also affect Sunday morning train services. The Unite bus strike will affect London United routes through west and south-west London and parts of Surrey.</p> <p>TfL urged people to avoid using the tube and only travel if essential on the rest of the network on Friday and until 8am on Saturday.</p> <p>Across the country, tens of thousands of members of the RMT, the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) and Unite walked out on Thursday, resulting in about one in five trains running, with some areas having no services all day.</p> <p>Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT, said: “We’re very sorry that people are inconvenienced. I mean, we’re inconveniencing people that are in the same boat as us. We’re ordinary men and women that want to do our jobs and provide a service, but when you’re being cut to pieces by an employer, and by the government, you’ve got to make a stand.</p> <p>“So we’re making that stand on behalf of our members, but many other workers in Britain are suffering some very similar things and you’re going to see a wave of this type of action. We can’t stand by and watch our conditions be chopped up.”</p> <p>The strikes came as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/no-10-denies-ministers-seeking-political-fight-with-rail-unions-rmt-strike\">Downing Street denied that ministers were deliberately seeking a political fight with rail unions</a> after both sides toughened their language further.</p> <p>“The priority is on making sure people who use public transport can get to work, school and hospital appointments without such disruption,” a No 10 source said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/19/cineworld-preparing-to-file-for-bankruptcy-following-pandemic-rout","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T13:04:11Z","webTitle":"Cineworld preparing to file for bankruptcy after pandemic rout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/cineworld-preparing-to-file-for-bankruptcy-following-pandemic-rout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/19/cineworld-preparing-to-file-for-bankruptcy-following-pandemic-rout","fields":{"headline":"Cineworld preparing to file for bankruptcy after pandemic rout","trailText":"London-listed company, which operates 751 sites in 10 countries, has run up debts of more than £4bn","byline":"Mark Sweney","body":"<p>Cineworld, the world’s second-largest cinema chain, is preparing to file for bankruptcy after failing to see a quick enough recovery in movie-going since the end of the pandemic.</p> <p>The London-listed business, which has run up debt of more than $4.8bn (£4bn) after losses soared while cinemas were shut during the global coronavirus crisis, has hired lawyers from Kirkland &amp; Ellis and consultants from restructuring experts AlixPartners to advise on the process.</p> <p>The company, which operates 751 sites in 10 countries including the Cineworld and Picturehouse chains in the UK, is expected to file a chapter 11 petition in the US and is considering insolvency proceedings in the UK, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Cineworld’s already battered share price crumpled from 20p to 2p after the report. Before the pandemic it was trading at £1.97.</p> <p>The move follows Cineworld’s market value <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/cineworld-shares-blockbusters-admissions-cinema-covid\">more than halving on Wednesday</a> after the company said it had started talks with stakeholders about a financial rescue package, blaming a lack of blockbuster films for lower-than-expected admissions.</p> <p>The group said it was in “active discussions with various stakeholders” and evaluating strategic options to obtain additional liquidity and potentially restructure its balance sheet to reduce debt. “Any deleveraging transaction will likely result in very significant dilution of existing equity interests in Cineworld,” it warned.</p> <p>Investors reacting to the news sent the company’s market value plunging to less than £50m on Friday, having been valued at as much as £4.4bn before the pandemic all but destroyed the cinema industry.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the chain said its business operations were expected to remain unaffected by its move to seek financial stability and that it “expects to continue to meet its ongoing business counterparty obligations”.</p> <p>Unions representing Cineworld’s 45,000 global workforce, including more than 5,000 in the UK, expressed concern about their fate.</p> <p>“This is very worrying news, not least for the UK’s Cineworld and Picturehouse workforce, who have already been through a tumultuous time during the pandemic,” said Philippa Childs, the head of the UK union Bectu.</p> <p>“We will do everything we can to support our members during this challenging time and will be looking to Cineworld to mitigate the impact of any bankruptcy arrangements on its employees.”</p> <p>Cineworld, which faces an almost $1bn payout for pulling out of a deal to buy its Canadian rival Cineplex, reported a $493m year on year increase in net debt to $4.8bn at the end of 2021.</p> <p>The group made a $708m loss last year. However, revenues more than doubled from $852m to $1.8bn, thanks to the latest James Bond and Spider-Man films. In 2020, the company reported a record $3bn loss.</p> <p>“The firm will blame the lack of summer blockbusters as a reason behind its sharp downfall but in reality its aggressive acquisition plan has taken on too much debt and this was always a huge risk as interest rates rise,” said Walid Koudmani, chief market analyst at the financial brokerage <a href=\"https://www.xtb.com/en\">XTB</a>.</p> <p>“Moreover, the move to stay-at-home entertainment and streaming providers has created a pivotal shift in the way consumers enjoy films, and Cineworld simply has not adapted fast enough. It’s all quite sad as the UK’s high street will now likely lose a popular and familiar brand name.”</p> <p>The company admitted about 95 million cinemagoers in 2021, up 75% on the 54 million in 2020 but well below the 275 million who attended before the Covid crisis.</p> <p>The state of Cineworld is in stark contrast to the performance of AMC Entertainment, the world’s largest cinema group and owner of the Odeon chain in the UK, which said the new Top Gun and Dr Strange films had fuelled a doubling of ticket sales in the US.</p> <p>The company, which has a $12.8bn market value, said July had the highest monthly attendance in US cinemas since before the pandemic.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/19/football-quiz-bad-starts-season-manchester-united-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T13:03:33Z","webTitle":"Football quiz: bad starts to a season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/football-quiz-bad-starts-season-manchester-united-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/19/football-quiz-bad-starts-season-manchester-united-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Football quiz: bad starts to a season","trailText":"Manchester United are propping up the Premier League table after two embarrassing defeats.

However, as Christians we believe there is a spiritual reality to our world and so this is not an insignificant choice and has the potential to impact on the town in negative ways.”</p> <p>It continues: “We would ask that you consider either making significant changes to the statue … or at the very least the name is changed so that it is an abstract piece of art with no spiritual element. Or that you consider removing or relocating the statue.”</p> <p>One of the signatories, Rev Pete Godfrey of the Light and Life Church, said the concern was not the look of the piece but the spiritual significance apparently attached to it. He added: “We see very clearly laid out by God that we are to have no gods but him and we are not to make idols, which is essentially a statue that represents another god.”</p> <p>Richard Pears, a town councillor who was mayor when the plans for the sculpture were coming to fruition, said he was surprised by the letter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff6538bb5b23fa6021908357f3f109e06d90406e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff6538bb5b23fa6021908357f3f109e06d90406e/0_247_5399_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandy Brown next to a scale model of the 10.5m ceramic artwork in her studio last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandy Brown next to a scale model of the ceramic artwork in her studio last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Probably not since the Reformation has a group of churches written to a local authority demanding the destruction of public art on the grounds that it offends the Almighty,” he said. “It all feels rather medieval.”</p> <p>He has written back quoting Paul’s letter to the Corinthians: “The thoughts of God no one knows, except the spirit of God.”</p> <p>Brown said the sculpture was meant to celebrate the area’s strong links to the china clay trade and represent a love of mother earth.

But you can you still nab a bargain if you shop wisely","byline":"Fiona Beckett","body":"<p>If you’ve just come back from a holiday in France, you may well be basking in the glow of all things French, particularly the wine you bought for a couple of euros down at the local cooperative. And even if you haven’t, the chances are that you still regard French wine as the best, especially if that was where you started your wine-drinking journey. (Gah? Did I just write that? Everything is a journey these days. Let’s try again:<em> “</em>Especially if, like me, the first wines you ever drank were French.”)</p> <p>Brexit certainly doesn’t seem to have stopped us, either. From Lidl, which has just launched its latest French Wine Tour, to The Wine Society, where French wine accounts for 60% of sales, French wine has a special place in our hearts.</p> <p>Does it deserve it, though? Certainly France can justifiably claim to make some of the greatest wines in the world, but it’s also responsible for some of the most mediocre, and many wines that trade on their reputation. Among those I would include many of the big name classics from Burgundy and Bordeaux, especially saint-émilion, sancerre and the big champagne brands, for which you’re undoubtedly paying for the name; similarly, Provence rosé can command at least £2 or £3 a bottle more than the neighbouring Languedoc just because of where it’s produced.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>France makes some of the greatest wines in the world, but it’s also responsible for some of the most mediocre </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There’s also a lot of French wine that could frankly have come from anywhere. You might like Lidl’s rich, plummy <a href=\"https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/the-french-wine-tour/val-de-salis-malbec-reserve/p53431\">Val de Salis Reserve Malbec 2021</a> (£6.99, 13.5%), but it could equally well have been made in Argentina. Maybe that doesn’t matter, but I have to say I like a wine with a sense of place.</p> <p>On the credit side, there are so many different and varied wine-producing regions in France – from the much under-rated Alsace in the north-east to Roussillon down in the south – that you could drink from France alone and never get bored. And there are often cheaper alternatives to the big names – beaujolais or the attractive mâcon in today’s pick, rather than burgundy, say, or bergerac instead of bordeaux. That said, there’s a lot of really good-value bordeaux of all colours, as well as the overpriced stuff. Try the totally distinctive clairet in today’s pick, a deep-coloured rosé from which claret takes its name. The southern Rhône and Languedoc also offer consistently good value, despite the challenge of their ever-increasing summer temperatures.</p> <p>It remains the case, though, that restaurants trade on the fact that French wines are held in such high esteem, so if you want to drink chablis or champagne, it’s definitely better to do so at home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"fdfdfd\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Five great-value buys from France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"‘‘\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"caad2b9818c35833a53954e474b6f2d37f44c756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caad2b9818c35833a53954e474b6f2d37f44c756/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Collin-Bourisset Mâcon rouge 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Collin-Bourisset Mâcon Rouge 2020</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/the-french-wine-tour/macon-collin-bourisset/p53428\">£6.99 Lidl</a>, 13%.

One treatment for gout involves stuffing a puppy with snails and sage, roasting it over a fire and using the rendered fat to make a salve. Another gout treatment suggests salting an owl and baking it until it can be ground into a powder, then mixing mix the powder with boar’s grease to make a salve. A treatment for cataracts instructs the reader to mix the gall bladder of a hare with some honey before applying it to the eye with a feather over the course of three nights.</p> <p>Dr James Freeman, who is supervising the project, said: “These recipes are a reminder of the pain and precarity of medieval life: before antibiotics, before antiseptics and before analgesics as we would know them all today.”</p> <p>The manuscripts allude to the gruesome ailments and injuries that afflicted medieval people – such as by including how to determine whether a skull has been fractured after a blow from a weapon – as well as day-to-day concerns that are relatable to modern society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/16/purges-angels-and-pigeon-slippers-methods-of-elizabethan-quacks-finally-deciphered\">Purges, angels and ‘pigeon slippers’: methods of Elizabethan quacks finally deciphered</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Freeman said: “Behind each recipe, however distantly, there lies a human story: experiences of illness and of pain, but also the desire to live and to be healthy.</p> <p>Some of the most moving, the manuscripts specialist believes, are “those remedies that speak of the hopes or tragic disappointments of medieval people: a recipe ‘for to make a man and woman to get children’, to know whether a pregnant woman carries a boy or a girl, and to ‘deliver a woman of a dead child’”.</p> <p>The project has been made possible thanks to £500,000 of funding from the Wellcome Trust.

As Hetherington says: “You state that you and your husband didn’t mind about not having children together or the lack of sex in the last six years. I wonder if there was any real examination of these two important issues in the light of your husband’s subsequent behaviour. There appears to have been an absence of discussion or emotional exploration [from] both of you.”</p> <p>What lesson do you think your husband has learned, and do you think you need to learn one, too? As Hetherington says: “You’ve idealised your relationship with your ex-husband and as you are now both unhappy you’re seeking one another, but how realistic is this for future happiness?”</p> <p>Then there’s your current partner, someone with whom you seem to share very little. “The big plus point here seems to be that you don’t argue,” says Hetherington. “Yet you don’t seem to do anything together. I do wonder if you are frightened of being alone.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes going back is the answer, and maybe it will be the right thing for you eventually</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s completely understandable to be afraid of being on your own, but as a justification for being with the wrong person it’s a short road to a long stretch of unhappiness. “It would be helpful,” says Hetherington, “for you to develop more of a sense of self.” I think you’re right to be worried – if your marriage foundered the first time without these challenges, I do wonder how it would cope second time round.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/15/a-friend-recently-attempted-suicide-what-can-i-do-to-stop-her-trying-again-ask-annalisa-barbieri\">A friend recently attempted to kill herself.

The teenager wanted to make a video game featuring Milne’s most famous character, the honey-addict bear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/04/revisiting-winnie-the-pooh-more-cutting-than-we-thought-when-we-were-six\">Winnie-the-Pooh</a>. To date, Hollis had written only a few games on the BBC Micro in his bedroom: festive-themed clones of popular arcade titles that swapped, say, the Easter bunny for Pac-Man, or Santa Claus for Space Invaders. A PC magazine had paid Hollis £40 to publish the source code to one of his Christmas-themed games, which readers could type out and play. A game featuring Winnie-the-Pooh, Hollis reasoned, could be a lucrative hit. A few weeks later he received a letter from Milne’s estate, provisionally offering him the video game rights to Winnie-the-Pooh for a minimum of £50,000. “It was out of our league at that point in time,” he says.</p> <p>Twelve years later, Hollis released GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64, a video game based on the James Bond film. There was little fanfare: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\">Bond</a>, like Winnie-the-Pooh, was a household name, but licensed games were viewed as the lowest form of a medium already widely considered to be profligate. Most movie “tie-ins”, as they were disparagingly called, were made to a punishing schedule to ensure they launched alongside the film. Their developers typically worked blind, limited by the narrative constraints of scripts that were unfinished and rarely suited to interactive treatment.</p> <p>“Everyone seemed to believe that a game made from a movie had to be bad, or mediocre,” says Hollis. “But I had the confidence of youth.”</p> <p>GoldenEye was, indeed, different. The film had already been out for two years when the game launched in August 1997. Its game tie-in featured tautly designed levels filled with moments of unscripted drama, tantalising secrets and a delicious competitive mode in which up to four friends caroused around themed maps, playing as various characters from Bond’s roster of heroes and villains. The game was a dazzling revelation. In time, GoldenEye sold more than 8m copies and dominated the rental charts for three years. Built by 12 young people working under punishing conditions, GoldenEye brought the first-person shooter to consoles and laid the design foundations on which many of the world’s most popular games stand today. Like any life-changing success, it came with equally enriching and destructive side-effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0618b221fa260058484e0ae2886d3ba407a5a482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0618b221fa260058484e0ae2886d3ba407a5a482/0_0_3413_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Happiness is a warm gun … GoldenEye’s Archives level.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Happiness is a warm gun … GoldenEye’s Archives level.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graslu00</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hollis, a graduate of Cambridge University’s computer science department, joined the software company Rare in 1993. While working on his first project at the studio, a fighting game for the arcades titled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Instinct_(1994_video_game)\">Killer Instinct</a>, he learned that colleagues had met some of the cast for the new James Bond film, codenamed “Bond 17”, to see if Rare was interested in making a video game based on the movie, the rights to which Nintendo’s cantankerous president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, had recently bought. Hollis’s colleagues left unimpressed. Undeterred, Hollis wrote a short design document for a Bond game in the tradition of arcade light-gun shooters such as Virtua Cop, in which players aim a plastic gun at the screen. The studio’s management accepted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/sep/10/from-goldeneye-to-south-park-10-of-the-best-video-games-based-on-films-and-tv-shows\">From GoldenEye to South Park: 10 of the best video games based on films and TV shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Founded by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper in 1985, Rare was situated in a manor farmhouse in rural Twycross, Leicestershire. The company employed about 40 people, and was rapidly growing, but retained the feel of a small family business. The Stampers’ parents and siblings cooked in the staff canteen, managed the accounts and worked as groundskeepers. Employees, however, were segregated. Teams working on different games were allocated separate barns, and only permitted to access that building, the canteen and the head office, their movements monitored by CCTV. An unproven team led by a rookie director on a project many believed was destined to flop, the GoldenEye crew were given a barn on the back lot, “out of sight and out of mind”, as Hollis puts it.</p> <p>“There was no interaction, no company culture,” recalls GoldenEye’s animator Brett Jones. Team members were not allowed to listen to music while at work. Management were, Hollis says, hands-off, but employees were encouraged to work long hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22934e3d48c85d052b2179b97d1e8c8ebd9a17c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22934e3d48c85d052b2179b97d1e8c8ebd9a17c2/0_123_851_511/500.jpg\" alt=\"A Rare breed … \" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Rare breed … (l-r) Kenji Okubo, David Doak, Mark Edmonds, Brett Jones, Grant Kirkhope, Karl Hilton, Graeme Norgate, Steve Ellis, Duncan Botwood.

At 28, Doak was one of the oldest members of the team. Having managed his own time as a postdoctoral student at Oxford, Rare’s strict working hours proved to be a culture shock. “You were expected to be there all the time,” he recalls. “You weren’t even allowed to pop out at lunchtime to, say, tax your car.”</p> <p>Unlike the Cambridge graduates in the team, 23-year-old Duncan Botwood had left university two years into an architecture course. As a fan of Ian Fleming’s original Bond novels, and the later books by John Gardner, at his interview he reeled off the different weapons and gadgets that may translate to a video game. Botwood was hired as GoldenEye’s dedicated game designer. He moved into a B&amp;B hotel across the road from Rare’s offices, returning to his parents’ house at weekends. With nothing else to do in Twycross after hours(occasionally the team visited Sega World in Tamworth), Botwood focused the writhing energies of youth into the game, working from early morning until 11 at night, with only a 30-minute lunch break. “I did stupidly long hours,” he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You’d come in at the weekend and someone would be washing their new Lamborghini in the yard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to Hollis, Rare’s management asked all development staff to sign a waiver relinquishing themselves from EU legislation that sought to limit overtime. Jones signed as did, Hollis says, every member of the team bar one. Midway through development, Hollis played through GoldenEye’s first level, closely based on the film’s opening scene. “I knew one thing for sure,” says Hollis. “The game sucked.” A trench mentality developed. With each missed deadline, the game’s release date drifted further from the GoldenEye film. The next Bond movie, Tomorrow Never Dies, was announced and Rare’s game remained incomplete. Nobody wanted to let down their colleagues by leaving the office early. “In the final push we were working 100-hour weeks, back-to-back,” says Doak.</p> <p>As well as team spirit, employees knew that the more hours they worked, the greater the potential bonus they could earn if their game proved to be a commercial success. Doak’s job offer letter stated: “Those employees who input additional effort and strive for the very best quality can earn generous bonuses.” Then, suggestively: “The office is open during the evenings and weekends for those employees who wish to maximise their efforts.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd6a145a5dbd7a66c6b02c91068795ce3dd69dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd6a145a5dbd7a66c6b02c91068795ce3dd69dc4/0_0_2880_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"GoldenEye’s 4-player deathmatch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four shoots to the wind … GoldenEye’s multiplayer deathmatch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graslu00</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones recalls that the team would typically take short lunch breaks, during which they would watch a 20-minute snippet of a Bond film. “That meant we watched about one Bond film a week,” Jones says. With no internet, all source material was derived from the films, novels and reference books. Jones was mainly interested in learning on the job, and had no particular ambition to make a classic game. But when the team implemented the competitive multiplayer mode, Jones realised they had designed something unusually compelling. “We had crowbarred it in,” he recalls, “but everyone was playing it all the time.”</p> <p>For friends who wanted to play together, GoldenEye’s competitive modes, which divided the screen into four quarters, one for each player, became akin to a sport. In the current age of detached online competition, the physicality of the sofa-based multiplayer experience, when bodies jostled, beer bottles were knocked over and slices of pizza were gobbled in the interludes, has been largely forgotten. But in 1997 it was powerful. As the game’s reputation spread, GoldenEye’s sales gained momentum. Each week, the team checked Blockbuster’s weekly rental figures. “When the line went up and up after three months, then six months, then a year, we knew the game was breaking rules in the market,” says Hollis. There were few celebrations to mark GoldenEye’s release. Some of the team travelled to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/e3\">E3 trade show</a> in Georgia, Atlanta, to support the game’s presentation to the press. “We hit the town pretty hard for nerds,” recalls Hollis. But overwork had become an unbreakable habit. Hollis immediately moved on to the next project. “It nearly killed me,” says Hollis. “And I was certainly very unhappy once the project was finished – a kind of postpartum depression that I think a lot of creative people experience. I should have taken a break rather than embarking on another project, but that was the culture. It caused me serious burnout.”</p> <p>The exhausted team’s feelings about the game’s warm critical reception were soon complicated when the cheques were handed out. Rare divided 12 cents from every copy sold between the team according to their seniority and logged overtime; this rose to 17.5 cents when the game sold enough copies. “There was no transparency, except that you could see what people were buying,” says Doak. Sports cars, parked in herds parked outside were the clearest manifestation of an individual’s success, and particularly which employees owned share options in the company, which Doak says created a kind of class divide. “You’d come in at the weekend and someone would be washing their new Lamborghini in the yard.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46bb74c96f8ed4e33440c66759ca4a47845747e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46bb74c96f8ed4e33440c66759ca4a47845747e2/226_361_2640_1584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Double-O heaven … GoldenEye’s icnic gunbarrel intro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Double-O heaven … GoldenEye’s iconic gunbarrel intro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graslu00</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones received about £6,000 for the several thousand hours of overtime he logged working on GoldenEye. “I bought a bicycle, a 32-inch television and a Hoover,” he recalls. “Retrospectively I can see it wasn’t fair. But at the time, I thought: ‘Free money!’” When he began work on GoldenEye’s sequel, Perfect Dark, the bonus terms had improved, partly because of Rare’s improved negotiating position in the market, and partly because the company owned the characters and IP. “Put it this way,” says Jones, “Perfect Dark bought me a house.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We had just come out of nowhere, so I figured we must be great. But the truth is, I just got lucky</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Doak felt his bonus reflected neither the effort he had put in, nor the value he had added to Rare’s bottom line. His disillusionment led him to leave Rare in 1998. In a few years Rare had evolved from a boutique family developer – the equivalent, as Botwood describes it, of a Savile Row tailor – to a company ripe for acquisition. Microsoft bought the studio in September 2002 for $375m. </p> <p>“People were damaged by the perception of unfairness,” says Hollis. In the long-term, the company’s opaque remuneration policies had a disruptive effect, as staff were incentivised to work on games that were expected to become major sellers. Employees assigned to less surefire hits, or games that were cancelled, felt disappointed and envious. Doak’s disillusionment led him to leave Rare in 1998, and most of GoldenEye’s team followed.</p> <p>While Botwood, who had no dependents, felt none of the animosity some older members of the team experienced, GoldenEye’s success had other corrosive effects. “I struggled with my ego,” he says. “I became overconfident. We had come out of nowhere, so I figured: we <em>must</em> be great. But the truth is, I just got lucky.” In the short term, GoldenEye’s success set unrealistic expectations for Botwood and established toxic working patterns – still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/25/coronavirus-drives-surge-in-support-for-unionisation-say-games-industry-activists\" title=\"\">widely encouraged across the industry today</a> – which, he says, led him to burnout from fatigue on three occasions. In the long term, however, the benefits of having worked on GoldenEye soon became clear. “Having GoldenEye on your CV became a magical calling card,” says Hollis. “Mentioning the game would open almost any door.” Jones left Rare to move into film and television, where he worked on Doctor Who and Guardians of the Galaxy. “I’ve worked on other projects that have meant more to me personally,” Jones says. “But whenever I need to crow a bit I just say the first game I made was GoldenEye.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"752f3a83cce4fcf6eea888bef9c38d84c37ad136\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/752f3a83cce4fcf6eea888bef9c38d84c37ad136/0_209_4842_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plug in a slay … The GoldenEye cartridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plug in and slay … the GoldenEye cartridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maurice Savage/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I was at Rare for just three years, but that time seems a much larger part of my life,” says Doak. “We still meet up. It feels a little like the victims of some boarding school scandal who get together 20 years later: yes, we experienced something that, with hindsight, was toxic. But we are excited to reminisce about the good times, too.”</p> <p>“I have complicated feelings of pride for GoldenEye,” says Hollis. “I think it is a great piece of work, but whenever someone says otherwise, I don’t feel the need to respond. With some projects the stars align. Yes, you work hard. Yes, the team is talented. But that isn’t enough. The entire world needs to be in the right place. It’s a mistake to attribute success to your own brilliance.”</p> <p>After he left Rare, Hollis became interested in exploring other modes of interaction in his work, away from the the Bond-like depictions of stage violence that have always been gaming’s primary currency. He became particularly interested in love, a metaphysical dynamic that the medium has struggled to depict meaningfully.</p> <p>Still, he rejects the suggestion that he was pushed towards nonviolent modes of interactivity because of GoldenEye’s success. “My favourite image of GoldenEye is the sight of four people playing the game. They’re sat together, maybe in an adolescent bedroom, all absorbed in the screen. In that moment, to me, GoldenEye is a game about love.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/19/liz-truss-lead-uk-sewage-leadership-marina-hyde","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T12:56:45Z","webTitle":"Who better than Liz Truss to lead a country whose own sewage laps at its shores? | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/liz-truss-lead-uk-sewage-leadership-marina-hyde","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/liz-truss-lead-uk-sewage-leadership-marina-hyde","fields":{"headline":"Who better than Liz Truss to lead a country whose own sewage laps at its shores?","trailText":"There are just two weeks left in a leadership contest that has been going on since sometime in the early Mesozoic period, says Guardian columnist Marina Hyde","byline":"Marina Hyde","body":"<p>Given the various crises besetting the UK, the seemingly inevitable passing of power from Boris Johnson to Liz Truss calls to mind that old political saying: out of the frying pan, into the heat death of the universe. The progression between the previous three prime ministers has shown us the timeline can always get worse. The country is basically trapped in that scene in Toy Story 3 where the toys escape the shredder only to find themselves heading towards the incinerator. Unfortunately, the grabber claw is not going to save us.</p> <p>You may keep hearing Truss supporters say: “You underestimate Liz at your peril.” But the UK is already in grave peril, so … I’ll take that bet. Presumably I’ll be permitted to collect on it in a couple of years, if not in cash, then certainly in some form of subsistence bartering in District 11 of the sunlit uplands.</p> <p>For now, Truss maintains the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/truss-sunak-sunshine-sacrifices-dark-times\">remorselessly upbeat demeanour</a> of a holiday rep who regards herself as the life and soul of the booze cruise, and whose lower back is tattooed with the Chinese symbols for “Only depressing people get depressed”. The overwhelming vibe you get from her campaign appearances is that she is going to make destitution fun for people. The logic puts me in mind of the Depression-era <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3c4o-7PH44\">dancehall marathons</a> epitomised in They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?, where desperate competitors are given the opportunity to twirl, then lurch, then stagger their way out of poverty. Or to death – whichever comes sooner.</p> <p>The fact that Liz will take over a country whose own sewage is literally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/beachgoers-warned-to-stay-away-after-sewage-alerts-across-england-and-wales\">lapping at its shores</a> feels too on the nose – an image so hammily overdone it could have been crafted by recidivist newspaper columnist Boris Johnson. Which, in a more literal way, I suppose it was. We’re both the sick man of Europe and the dirty protest of Europe. Johnson – who wouldn’t dream of swimming in his own excrement, either literally or metaphorically – is currently on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/15/boris-johnsons-summer-of-fun-what-has-the-pm-been-doing\">second foreign holiday</a> in a fortnight, displacing whole hogsheads of the Aegean in the cause of not giving a toss about what happens to the country he let down in the way he has always let everyone down in the end. Back home, consumer confidence has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/uk-consumer-confidence-weaker-than-during-major-recessions-inflation\">hit a record low</a>. One expert in charge of monitoring it declared on Thursday: “These findings point to a sense of capitulation, of financial events moving far beyond the control of ordinary people.”</p> <p>Does anyone truly believe they will be within the control of Liz Truss, whose weathervaning and largely underachieving career thus far has marked her out as a very ordinary politician indeed? Her political philosophy appears to consist of only two immutable tenets: that tax cuts are the answer to everything, and that British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/lazy-british-workers-catch-up-with-liz-truss-once-again\">workers are incredibly lazy</a>.</p> <p>Despite being a message somewhat questionably suited to the times, this has apparently caused a twitch in the phantom loins of the 0.42% of British voters who will be deciding the next prime minister. With just the two weeks left to run in a leadership contest that has been going on since sometime in the early Mesozoic period, Truss remains an absolute mine of withheld information. She tells every Tory member hustings all about her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/09/liz-truss-stands-firm-on-tax-cuts-over-support-for-energy-bills\">“day one” tax cuts</a>, but precisely nothing about how the state will be shrunk to pay for them. Hers is a campaign in which reality is treated like a non-member at the club, whose unauthorised incursion into the 19th hole will be put down with putters and sand wedges, <em>pour encourager les autres</em>.</p> <p>Still, it’ll be interesting watching Liz try to give a pep talk to gravity. It emerged on Thursday that the Office for Budget Responsibility is to <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/liz-truss-black-hole-tax-plan-budget-watchdog-public-spending-1803609\">update its forecast</a> of Britain’s public finances next month, stating that government borrowing will increase as a result of high inflation and a widely predicted recession. This halves the £30bn of fiscal headroom that Truss claims will pay for her tax cuts, which leaves us officially in yawning black hole territory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/thatcherism-obsolete-ideology-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-tories\">Thatcherism is an obsolete ideology – but it’s the only one that Sunak and Truss have | Andy Beckett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, we’ve spent a lot of this leadership context hearing from Liz that a recession is not even inevitable. So just assume that she’ll take the keys to No 10, like the idealistic heroine in a horror movie who buys her dream fixer-upper in Upstate Somewhere, and has barely got her whitewash out before a series of terrifyingly grotesque and inexplicable events begin to unfold.</p> <p>You might be wondering how much worse our standard of government could actually get, given that we ceded control of the country to a newspaper columnist for almost three years. And in many ways you’d be right. It’s actually quite difficult to find people who are more wrong on a regular basis than newspaper columnists – but it’s possible that economists do edge it. Patrick Minford certainly does.</p> <p>The Cardiff university professor so admired by Truss is one of Britain’s leading wrong people – tough field – having forecast such fantasies as Brexit <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/08/24/most-economists-say-brexit-will-hurt-the-economy-but-one-disagrees\">boosting Britain’s GDP</a> by almost 7% and significantly reducing consumer prices for British people, to say nothing of his giving the zealot’s shrug over the potential self-imposed destruction of the country’s car industry. “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rorystewartuk/status/1056568783400243201?lang=en\">These things happen</a> as evolution takes place in your economy,” Minford breezed to a parliamentary committee back in 2012. As for who’ll be joining Patrick in executive Loon Town, there are persistent rumours that Truss plans to exhume Iain Duncan Smith and John Redwood to give them operational roles.</p> <p>So that’s the lie of the land, two weeks out from an expected Truss premiership. There will be those of you feeling pessimism is the rational response, and it’s hard to disagree.

The regulator says this is because it introduced a new reporting methodology and that it has had to recalculate past leakage volumes to bring them in line with it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-2-zip/giv-65629eLsyIQ5Vkx2/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-2-zip/giv-65629eLsyIQ5Vkx2/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Ofwat said it “updated leakage performance reporting for consistency, requiring all companies to report a three-year average” and that before the sector’s PR19 (2019-24) five-year business period, “companies were able to report performance in different terms – for example some used annual figures and others used three-year averages or averages over a longer period”.</p> <p>Feargal Sharkey, the musician and vice-president of the charity WildFish, said the changes suggested the previous leakage figures were “basically bollocks” as companies could choose how to present the figures, and showed “Ofwat has been taken hostage by the water industry and is suffering a bad case of Stockholm syndrome”.</p> <p>“People will no longer accept this kind of propaganda and Ofwat, with all its incompetence and failings, needs to start behaving like a regulator,” he added.</p> <p>As with sewage pollution discharges, the sector reports its leakage volumes to the regulator after having them verified by external consultants contracted by the water companies.</p> <p>Each company assesses leakage using Ofwat’s methodology, a top-down approach based on a water balance and a bottom-up calculation that looks at minimum night flows in discrete metered areas. The two assessments are then reconciled using a “maximum likelihood estimate” statistical method, but given the complexity of the systems some uncertainty around the figures remains.</p> <p>Ofwat says the provisional and unverified 2021-22 leakage volumes are at the “lowest level since privatisation” but performance is still not good enough and that it will keep pushing the water companies.</p> <p>“Over the last 20 years we’ve imposed fines, penalties and secured spending commitments totalling over £339m specifically for failure on leakage,” an Ofwat spokesperson said.</p> <p>“This money has been used to improve performance, and where appropriate, money has been returned to customers at the expense of shareholders. Companies’ performance on leakage has been improving in recent years but it is still not good enough … Where they fail, we will act to hold them to account.”</p> <p>A Water UK spokesperson said water companies were committed to “radically reducing leakage, building on recent announcements of the lowest ever on record with further steep reductions planned each year.</p> <p>“Companies have increasingly been putting innovation and technology at the heart of these efforts. Intelligent networks, smart sensors, satellite technology and drones are all part of the armoury that’s being deployed to detect and fix leaks faster than ever.”</p> <p>The spokesperson said investment was needed to increase storage. “We have proposed and are progressing £14bn of new investment to deliver 18 projects that include reservoirs and extensive schemes to move water around the country, enough to supply 10 million people.”</p> <p>Defra said it had “already proposed tough short- and long-term targets on water companies to reduce water leakages and are proposing legally binding targets to reduce leaks by over 30% by 2037.</p> <p>“The government will continue to challenge those with the poorest records on leakage to maintain their networks and lower the levels of water needlessly lost. If we don’t see the changes we expect, we won’t hesitate to take further action.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/why-areas-uk-drought-visual-guide\">Why are some areas of the UK in drought?

Sweney","body":"<p>Sky has been breaking consumer protection rules by not informing pay-TV customers that their contracts are due to expire so they can shop around for cheaper deals, according to a ruling by telecoms regulator Ofcom.</p> <p>Following a long-running investigation, Ofcom has found that Sky, which has about 9 million TV customers, is in breach of rules by failing to send end-of-contract (ECN) notifications to its pay-TV customers.</p> <p>Sky is the only major telecoms company not to send notifications – by text, email or letter – which are designed to make customers aware that they have the option of switching or getting a better deal with their existing provider.</p> <p>Ofcom estimates that between February 2020, when the new ECN rules were implemented, and the end of last year 3.5 million Sky TV customers were not told they could look around to save money on their TV packages.</p> <p>The rules require broadband, mobile, home phone and pay-TV companies to notify customers 10 to 40 days before deals end, because they are deemed to be public “electronic communications services”.</p> <p>Sky says that while it notifies broadband and phone customers it does not consider its satellite pay-TV service to fall under Ofcom’s definition and so is not obliged to send the notifications.</p> <p>“We have directed Sky to take all necessary steps to comply with its regulatory obligations to send end-of-contract notifications to customers of its relevant pay-TV services,” Ofcom said.</p> <p>It said Sky now has nine months to start sending notifications, although the company has up to two months to lodge an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal.</p> <p>“In addition, Sky must provide Ofcom with a progress report no later than four months from the date of this decision on the steps it will take to ensure the remedy is fully implemented within the nine months given.”</p> <p>Sky’s refusal to join other telecoms operators such as BT and Virgin Media 02 in sending out the notifications puts it in an increasingly difficult position as the cost of living crisis stretches household budgets to the limit.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Sky and its rivals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/29/strikes-add-to-headaches-for-bt-after-pandemic-plaudits\">increased bills by almost 10%</a> but the industry mostly avoided criticism as it came before inflation hit a 40-year high, making energy and food bills the biggest financial issue facing households.</p> <p>In June, the UK’s biggest mobile and broadband companies were <a

to a summit at Downing Street</a> to agree a plan to help customers struggling to pay bills, including moves to allow switching to cheaper deals without paying a penalty.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sky said: “We continue to believe Sky’s pay-TV service is not an electronic communication service under the legal definition in the Communications Act 2003, but we note the outcome of Ofcom’s investigation. </p> <p>“We look forward to working with Ofcom to seek a legal review.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/19/deshaun-watson-suspension-reaction-cleveland-browns","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T12:48:00Z","webTitle":"The

remember that Deshaun is only 26 and is a high-level quarterback.” </p> <p><em>Ding ding ding.</em> Watson is “high-level” quarterback and Cleveland is banking that with enough time and touchdowns, fans will forget his transgressions and the wins and associated revenue will come pouring in. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

</aside>  <p>That is why the Cleveland Browns “won” the Watson sweepstakes by frontloading $230m in guaranteed money and a measly yearly salary, all so the quarterback would be minimally impacted by any length of suspension. Watson is a high-level quarterback, so Cleveland rewarded him knowing full well he was accused of being a sexual predator and was likely to miss a significant chunk of the season. Because of Watson’s high-level ability, Haslam, along with his wife Dee and general manager Andrew Berry, stood in front of cameras and issued the usual platitudes about how they properly vetted Watson and believe he’s a good guy and he’s going to be a community stalwart, and they believe in second chances. Nowhere did the Haslams appear to have an ounce of respect for their fanbase – or empathy for the alleged victims. </p> <p>The Browns signed Watson knowing at the very least he had a disturbing fetish and at worst was a serial sexual predator. They didn’t care. After all, high-level quarterbacks don’t grow on trees. </p> <p>To recap, Watson’s suspension stems from a lengthy NFL investigation in the wake of 24 massage therapists filing civil suits accusing him of sexual misconduct. The lawsuits describe a multitude of lurid behavior by Watson. <a href=\"https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2022/06/22/24th-woman-suing-deshaun-watson-said-he-masturbated-and-ejaculated/7536166001/\">One suit</a> accuses Watson of demanding that a young masseuse work his inner thighs before he started masturbating. She was stunned and froze. Watson responded by saying, ‘Relax. It is okay to touch it.’ ”the suit said. Then he ejaculated. According to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/sports/football/deshaun-watson.html\">New York Times investigation</a>, Watson booked sessions with at least 66 different massage therapists in the span of 17 months. </p> <p>Watson has settled with 23 of the 24 women and now the NFL, yet so much remains unsettling about this case, especially Watson’s stone-cold inability to show remorse. </p> <p>This lack of remorse was cited as one of the reasons leading to the initial six-game suspension issued by disciplinary officer Sue L Robinson. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc23869209956de694264c22a1768e67d7dc6ff2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc23869209956de694264c22a1768e67d7dc6ff2/0_0_5133_3339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Haslam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cleveland Browns managing and owner Jimmy Haslam, right, speaks to the media on Thursday while general manager Andrew Berry, center, and co-owner Dee Haslam listen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Gunter/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With settlement talks brewing, Watson’s camp attempted to play along. Ahead of last Friday’s preseason game in Jacksonville, Watson participated in a cringy in-house interview that appeared to be scripted. “I want to say that I am truly sorry to all of the women that I have impacted in this situation,” he told the Browns broadcast crew. “The decisions that I made in my life that put me in this position, I would definitely like to have back, but I want to continue to move forward and grow and learn and show that I am a true person of character.”</p> <p>Then there’s the league and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who went public last week and stated that Deshaun Watson deserved a year for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/10/deshaun-watson-nfl-suspension-appeal-ruling-cleveland-browns\">“predatory behavior.”</a>. But if Goodell truly believed this in his heart of hearts and wanted to make an example of Watson, he could have utilized the power granted to him in the CBA to oversee the appeal and issue a year suspension. He could have shown fans and women who have been victimized by sexual predators that the league cares about them. That this wouldn’t just be the latest example of a rich athlete or celebrity escaping trouble with minimal damage. </p> <p>But the NFL didn’t save face because soon after the settlement with Watson was made public, he made the league, and himself, look like even bigger fools. An underlying premise of the settlement was an acknowledgement that Watson did something wrong and needed to be remorseful. Goodell, in the league’s statement, said “Deshaun is committed to doing the hard work on himself. Watson played along for a split second issuing a statement claiming he takes, “accountability for the decisions I have made.”</p> <p>Literally minutes later, he flushed any semblance of remorse down the toilet. “I’ve always been able to stand on my innocence and always said I never assaulted or disrespected anyone,” he told reporters.</p> <p>As if Watson’s bait and switch didn’t feel icky enough, there was the quick realization that Watson’s return in Week 13 will be on the road in … Houston. C’mon. No one in the league office thought they should speak up and point out this is a horrific idea that appears incredibly self-serving? </p> <p>After the “homecoming” in Houston, Watson and the Browns will travel to Cincinnati where the chanting is likely to be even more severe than the “you sick fuck” chants Jags fans hurled at him last week. </p> <p>But insults won’t mitigate the damage. Watson’s behavior has been perverse and his attempts at apologizing hollow. That Watson is allowed to take the field this season is, quite frankly, horrifying. It’s an affront to Browns fans with a moral compass, NFL fan who are parents and must explain this to their kids, anyone with functioning brain cells really. And it’s the latest reminder to these alleged victims and women everywhere that when it’s us v a high-level NFL player, no decision-maker will be on our side. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/19/republican-carl-paladino-comment-garland-should-be-executed-facetious-hitler","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T12:33:43Z","webTitle":"Republican says comment Garland should be executed was ‘facetious’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/19/republican-carl-paladino-comment-garland-should-be-executed-facetious-hitler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/19/republican-carl-paladino-comment-garland-should-be-executed-facetious-hitler","fields":{"headline":"Republican says comment Garland should be executed was ‘facetious’","trailText":"Carl Paladino, a Republican candidate for Congress in New York, recently caused controversy when he praised Adolf Hitler","byline":"Martin Pengelly and agencies","body":"<p>A Republican candidate for Congress in New York said he was “being facetious” when, in the same interview, he said the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, should be executed for authorising the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s Florida home.</p> <p>The candidate, Carl Paladino, recently caused controversy when he <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/gop-candidate-carl-paladino-calls-161513014.html\">praised Adolf Hitler</a>, as “the kind of leader we need today”.</p> <p>Paladino made his remark about the attorney general in an <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2022/08/13/republican-ny-congressional-candidate-carl-paladino-mar-a-lago-raid-susan-rice-likely-behind-gestapo-tactics/\">interview</a> with the far-right site <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/news/paladino-saying-hitler-kind-of-leader-we-need-was-mistake/\">Breitbart</a>.

The report finds that, from 1979 to 2021, there has been a 43% increase across all species.</p> <p>Of the 20 species analysed, nine have increased significantly: these include speckled wood, small heath and pearl-bordered fritillary butterflies. Grayling and small tortoiseshell butterflies have experienced significant declines, and the rest showed no marked change.</p> <p>While variations in population are also affected by habitat changes, pesticides and pollution, the changing climate and weather are the most likely drivers of change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd8a2d940e39908ce5ef0350a83eaf80f57ebbce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd8a2d940e39908ce5ef0350a83eaf80f57ebbce/0_291_4964_2979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasius/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report also highlights how some butterfly populations in the UK are continuing to shift northwards as a response to the climate crisis. Over the past 20 years, species traditionally found in the UK’s warmer southerly climes, such as orange-tip and peacock butterflies, have become more numerous in Scotland.</p> <p>But despite this short-term increase, the report also highlights how sensitive butterflies are to environmental change. More frequent droughts and wildfires, for example, would kill adult butterflies as well as the plants their caterpillars feed on.</p> <p>Simon Foster, a trends and indicators analyst at NatureScot, said: “We need to be working now to help butterfly populations deal with the increasing influences of climate change. Fortunately, there are easy things we can all do to help butterflies.</p> <p>“It’s wonderful to see many local authorities and individuals using wildflower seed mixes, which will make a big difference in local areas.

It became apparent nobody was going to come quickly so with rain coming in it was a matter of keeping him warm and dry and as comfortable as possible.</p> <p>“It’s not the paramedics’ fault – when they came their care was superb, they were very caring, I’ve got no complaints there. But the system’s not right somehow, something’s broken.

He had fractured ribs, a fractured pelvis, grazes to his head and a cut to his arm.</p> <p>Because they had been advised not to move him, they tried to protect him from the elements as they waited. His son, other relatives and neighbours did their best to keep him safe and comfortable.</p> <p>They used a neighbour’s goal, a tarpaulin found in a garage and umbrellas to try to make the shelter rainproof. Wakeley had recently been given a heated blanket, which helped keep him warm. “We had to make the best of a difficult situation,” said Phil Wakeley. His father is now being treated at Royal Cornwall hospital in Truro.</p> <p>In a report published in May, the Care Quality Commission said ambulance waiting response times in Cornwall <a href=\"https://api.cqc.org.uk/public/v1/reports/5277d8f3-8a58-4325-b5b0-09ec093af9da?20220527070052\">were “extremely concerning and pose a high level of risk to patient safety”.</a> It added: “Ambulance handover delays at hospitals in the region were some of the highest recorded in England.

The issues include delayed discharges to social care and other services, as well as bed occupancy. A whole-system approach is needed to tackle this issue.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly’s integrated care system said: “Like other parts of the country, our health and care system continues to experience pressure. The reasons for this are complex, including high demand for primary and secondary care, mental health services and adult social care.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for South Western ambulance service NHS foundation trust said “We are shocked and sorry for the experience Mr Wakeley endured. Our ambulance clinicians strive every day to give their best to patients.

OK, so there’s a token effort to bind the whole thing together, by asking (and nothing could be more generic for a first full show) “who is Thanyia Moore?” By way of a response, the south Londoner takes us on a whistle-stop tour of her life, from childhood on a so-called ghetto estate in New Cross, via her experience <a href=\"https://prodance.co.uk/artists/info/plague\">winning the 2005 World Hip-hop Dance Championship</a>, to a recent sky-dive for a panel show on Dave. Random? Indeed it is.

But if you don’t get quantity, there’s certainly quality, especially when it comes to Moore’s performing abilities. She’s a fantastically commanding comic, with fine crowd skills and the gift of an infectious laugh. There’s real warmth to the opening section, which introduces us to her no-nonsense mum and, with the story behind the unusual spelling of her name, to her ineffectual dad.</p> <p>The street dance set-piece at the heart of the show is strong, too – so much so, and so remarkable the experience it relates (replete with more video footage), I wished she’d built the show around it.

If she plans to squat in the seat until the next election, she needs to do the decent thing. She had a really good reputation locally, but now has tarnished all that.”</p> <p>Ferrier’s sentencing was deferred pending background reports until next month. A recall petition could be triggered depending on what kind of sentence she receives and whether she is subsequently suspended from the Commons for 10 or more days. It would then require 10% of eligible constituents to sign it in order to trigger a byelection.</p> <p>Robert Brown, a Scottish Liberal Democrat councillor for Rutherglen South, said that although the strength of feeling about her behaviour had diminished since it was first revealed – “when people were frankly outraged” – it remained likely that a recall petition would gather enough signatures if the grounds existed. “Meanwhile, people are frustrated that there are being deprived of the full services of a sitting MP.”</p> <p>Nationally, opposition parties are calling for the SNP, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/01/snp-mp-margaret-ferrier-took-train-after-positive-covid-test\">suspended her from the party</a> in October 2020, to expel Ferrier.</p> <p>The Scottish Lib Dem leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, told the Scottish Daily Express that the MP had “made herself a pantomime villain in her own community”.

The attitude was: ‘Let’s go, let’s make it as good as we can,’ and, so far, we’re doing OK.”</p> <p>Significantly Spacey-Cale’s team – which, bolstered by seven new summer signings has now turned fully professional – shares facilities with Ralph Hasenhüttl’s men at the club’s Staplewood training base.</p> <p>“The beauty of integration is that I can walk into one of the men’s coaches’ rooms and have a serious football conversation,” says Spacey-Cale. “At Southampton it’s seen as normal that men and women are treated the same way; not all clubs are as forward thinking.”</p> <p>She knows widespread change will necessitate the recruitment of more women across the football spectrum. “It’s not just about playing, it’s about getting involved as coaches, administrators, physios,” she says. “More women having that opportunity to work in the game is something we’ve got to drive and push for.”</p> <p>The same goes for increasing female football’s fanbase and Spacey-Cale is anxious to tap into the enthusiasm generated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report\">England’s Euro 2022 triumph</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db61ac7340b294f6b36ad2a3b227475bccd65513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db61ac7340b294f6b36ad2a3b227475bccd65513/0_93_4468_2680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marieanne Spacey-Cale, the Southampton women’s head coach, during the FA Women’s National League Southern Premier match against Portsmouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marieanne Spacey-Cale hopes women’s football can continue to grow following England’s success at Euro 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabelle Field/Southampton FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We’ve got a real hardcore of supporters who’ve already booked their flights from Southampton to Newcastle for the Championship games at Durham and Sunderland in January and February,” she says.</p> <p>“But our season ticket sales are up 160% so there’s a whole new audience and I’m sure we’ll have a really good crowd against Charlton. The challenge is to see how many of those who still aren’t sure about women’s football we can win over.”</p> <p>Rising standards in a highly competitive and increasingly professionalised division promoted Liverpool were relieved to escape last season should help. With ambitious Bristol City and Durham among those pushing for a WSL place this season, Spacey-Cale is braced for a tough induction.</p> <p>“The Championship’s a strong league,” she says. “All 12 teams have invested, everyone’s recruited so it’s going to be extremely tight and extremely challenging. Everyone here is really excited to discover what playing in it feels like.”</p> <p>Several of the England players she worked with during her FA tenure now know precisely what it means to be a European Champion. “I feel proud of them – and excited about what they can do at next summer’s World Cup,” she says. “But everyone who has been involved in women’s football, right back to the days when we were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/13/how-the-fa-banned-womens-football-in-1921-and-tried-to-justify-it\">banned from playing</a>, are part of this success.</p> <p>“Now it’s up to the current generation to ensure they continue making their predecessors proud. It’s about building on this summer’s success in the right way.”</p> <p>At Southampton, too many ceilings have already been shattered for Spacey-Cale to call a halt to her own construction project any time soon. “We’ve always said we want to be a WSL club,” she says. “We know it’ll take maybe three or four years but that’s where we want to be.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/19/digested-week-crap-sifting-and-seed-gathering-i-was-born-for-middle-age","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T11:15:16Z","webTitle":"Digested week: crap sifting and seed gathering – I was born for middle age | Lucy Mangan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/digested-week-crap-sifting-and-seed-gathering-i-was-born-for-middle-age","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/19/digested-week-crap-sifting-and-seed-gathering-i-was-born-for-middle-age","fields":{"headline":"Digested week: crap sifting and seed gathering – I was born for middle age","trailText":"Plus, rain at last, A-level nightmares, and losing my height advantage over my 11-year-old son","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Today I took delivery of 20 large, sturdy, matching storage boxes in which to store all the 20 categories of crap in my house, thereby fulfilling a lifetime’s ambition of having 20 large, sturdy, matching storage boxes in which to store all the 20 categories of crap in my house.</p> <p>I also set up a shelving unit above the washing machine and transferred all the dish cloths, dish towels, hand towels, loo paper and kitchen roll on to it.

My parched soul drinks deep of the satisfaction.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Well, that was quick. My son is now taller than me. I find this very rude. I went to all the trouble of making him, and then the much, much greater trouble of giving birth to him – for which he has still not properly thanked me – and now he has overtaken me in the height stakes after just 11 years. Rude, I tell you. Rude.</p> <p>People of average or above-average height do not know how fragile a hold we shortarses have on normal life. I need heels to be part of any conversational orbit at a party. I have no chance of getting served at a bar. I can’t reach the top cabinet shelves in any kitchen. And I simply have no natural authority anywhere. Except, briefly, over my son – as his mother, but far more potently as someone taller than him. You don’t realise quite how powerful a weapon it is in the parental arsenal until it’s gone. Now when I issue commands he can literally look me in the eye as he decides whether or not to comply. Generally, being a fundamentally accommodating individual, he does as he’s told. But he’s only 11. By the time the hormonal storm begins he will be nine feet above me and essentially ungovernable. A friend of mine has twin boys and from the time they turned 13, whenever she started shouting at them, they would simply lift her up and deposit her outside the room. I used to laugh my head off whenever I heard about it. Not any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e8adba8ee449ac617329c13c04cacddabceed59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e8adba8ee449ac617329c13c04cacddabceed59/0_229_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A-level students\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picture of the week: Ofsted has launched an investigation after it was revealed that just 0.01% of brunette students passed their A-levels this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Thursday</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2022/aug/18/a-level-exam-results-day-2022-live-ucas-university-clearing\">A-level results day</a>. What a godawful Proustian rush it is. I took mine 30 years ago and I <em>still</em> have nightmares about them. Literally. I turn up for my exam – English, usually, Spanish sometimes – and realise I’ve forgotten to go to any classes for the previous two years. I wake up in a lashing sweat.</p> <p>They are the worst exams you’ll ever do in your life, dear youngsters, and I speak as one who trained as a solicitor and once had to take one in land law, with questions such as: “When does a constructive trust arise over a properitarily estopped right of easement without equitable title but with an entailed fee simple and a cherry on top? Give reasons for your answer in the original Norman French, upon whose mad mutterings the entire system is based” scattered lavishly across its pages.</p> <p>They measure only two things: your maturity (ie how well you’ve been able to resist every natural urge and stay in to revise instead) and your ability to function under stress. Obviously the first comes only with age, and the second one is a gift you have either been handed by the genetic gods or not. Grade F, the lot of them.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>I feel a deep sense of peace – or at least the closest thing to it that is possible now, a kind of … desperate acceptance? Forcible resignation? Coma of the soul? – now that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexiters</a> have nearly achieved their goal. Not of leaving the EU or restoring British sovereignty or whatever gloss they put on it, but of returning us to the wartime state that was, they know with the feverish certainty of all ideologues, when We Were Best.</p> <p>For we hover, surely, on the cusp of rationing of all kinds. Water (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/thames-water-announces-hosepipe-ban-south-england-london\">hosepipe bans</a> are at last appearing), fuel, food, healthcare, travel – all are in effect becoming more and more unavailable to more and more people. Eventually, formal arrangements will have to be made and coupons allocated. I promise you, it is this, ration books rather than blue passports, that they have truly wanted. They want to live in the glorious past for a bit, even if it’s not their own, and experience what they have always imagined is the best of British, writ in Spam.</p> <p>And then – and THEN – it will be out of their systems. They can heave a sigh of satisfaction and/or realise that privation isn’t all it’s cracked up to be and start romanticising a future of plenty, involving free and steady trade with other countries, jaunts abroad, drugs and hospital beds, petrol at the pumps and all sorts of other exciting things that, if you’re an idiot, you don’t miss till they’re gone.</p> <p>And then this frothing madness will subside and we can go on with our lives. Just give them the coupons, ASAP.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/19/dont-call-police-over-hosepipe-ban-breaches-britons-urged","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T11:08:55Z","webTitle":"Don’t call police over hosepipe ban breaches, Britons urged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/dont-call-police-over-hosepipe-ban-breaches-britons-urged","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/19/dont-call-police-over-hosepipe-ban-breaches-britons-urged","fields":{"headline":"Don’t call police over hosepipe ban breaches, Britons urged","trailText":"Forces already receiving 999 calls before restrictions come into force, diverting call handlers from emergencies","byline":"Jamie Grierson","body":"<p>Police chiefs have urged members of the public not to report suspected breaches of hosepipe bans to forces.</p> <p>Police forces have already received 999 calls about residents’ use of water, even before restrictions are in place.</p> <p>However, the hosepipe ban is a civil matter, not a criminal one, and police call handlers are being diverted away from dealing with real emergencies.</p> <p>A National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesperson said: “Breaches of hosepipe bans are a civil matter and should not be reported to the police.</p> <p>“Any member of the public who has concerns about a potential breach should consider the advice from their water provider.”</p> <p>Devon and Cornwall police said there had been “unprecedented demand” on their phone lines about a number of issues this summer, with more than 1,000 calls a day.</p> <p>Assistant chief constable Nikki Leaper said: “We are also already getting calls from people reporting breaches of the hosepipe ban due to come in next week – which should be directed to the water company.</p> <p>“All these issues should be dealt with by other agencies.

The pseudonymous producer of Kneecap<strong> </strong>is sitting in a Hungarian Airbnb with his fellow band members, MCs Móglaí Bap and Mo Chara, talking over Zoom. Fifteen hundred miles from home, the Belfast hip-hop provocateurs are still processing the events of the previous weekend.</p> <p>On 12 August, ahead of performing to 10,000 people at West Belfast community festival Féile an Phobail, the group unveiled a mural depicting a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Land Rover in flames. Painted in a childish cartoon style, it was accompanied by the tagline “<em>Níl fáilte roimh an RUC</em>,” or “The RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary, superseded by the PSNI in 2001] aren’t welcome”. Kneecap – a working-class trio who rap almost exclusively in their native Irish – were soon trending, spawning thousands of takes spanning their country’s fractious political spectrum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a65fd897d88a2555c19ae90e61afb17a8c6e85a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a65fd897d88a2555c19ae90e61afb17a8c6e85a/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kneecap’s mural of a burning PSNI Land Rover on Hawthorn Street in Belfast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kneecap’s mural of a burning PSNI Land Rover on Hawthorn Street in Belfast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many, the mural was Banksy-lite political art or, at a push, a regressive publicity stunt. For others, including Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie, it had more inflammatory connotations. “This just fosters hatred,” he said. “It’s grooming a new generation of young people with insidious messaging.”</p> <p>The mural was based on artwork from their merch, which features a line from the trio’s 2017 debut single CEARTA (Irish for “rights”, as in human rights). The unveiling at the Hawthorn Bar, just off the traditionally nationalist Falls Road, was warmly received by locals. By the time the cyber-outrage spilled over into the national press, Kneecap were long gone, en route to play Hungarian festival Sziget.</p> <p>“We haven’t stopped laughing,” Móglaí Bap says, donning sunglasses even over Zoom. “We left for Europe the day after it all kicked off. We had no converters for our phones so we haven’t had a lot of access to social media for the last few days. Our manager contacted us to let us know the craic but we hadn’t read anything.”</p> <p>It may be breaking news to many but Kneecap – named after the paramilitary practice of shooting perceived perpetrators in the knee – have wielded satire from the off. The trio’s 2017 debut mixtape, 3CAG, was self-aware and swaggering in equal measure as it flipped between nights on the town to the everyday reality of growing up in post-Troubles Northern Ireland. Bellicose one bar and incisive the next, songs like Amach Anocht (Out Tonight) tackled the overlap between youth culture and intergenerational trauma, as well as living in a working-class, dual-language world.</p> <p>“The reality is we’re stuck in the middle,” says Móglaí Bap. “Not only do we have loyalists and unionists on one side, we have dissident republicans on the other. I think that sums up what we stand for. It’s not like we’re the cultural wing of the CIRA [Continuity Irish Republican Army] or something.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sf0htzbMKk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8Sf0htzbMKk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Kneecap: CEARTA – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>You don’t need to speak Irish or come from a nationalist background to appreciate that Kneecap’s output runs parallel to their lived experience. With recruitment from the nationalist community in the PSNI currently at less than 25%, their music, much like their mural, speaks to a complex reality.</p> <p>“Anti-police sentiment has been longstanding in the hip-hop community,” Móglaí Bap says. “This isn’t new. We didn’t burn a police Land Rover, we painted one. Some people are more worried about a piece of art than the effigies of real politicians hanging off bonfires. We don’t want to be fighting or advocating violence. We want people to be thinking.”</p> <p>Such words aren’t likely to wash with many who expressed their concern last weekend. Among them was Naomi Long, minister of justice and the leader of Northern Ireland’s centrist political party Alliance. “The band in question court controversy – it’s publicity and I doubt this latest mural will do them any harm,” she wrote. “However, the same can’t be said of young children being groomed into sectarian hatred.”</p> <p>“It was just confusing more than anything,” says Mo Chara now. “I looked at the fucking thing a million times, thinking, ‘How is this in any way sectarian?’ We took the design from a PSNI colouring book sent out to schools because they had such poor support from young people in the community.”</p> <p>“I would suggest looking into the Alliance’s stance on the British army in the north,” adds Móglaí Bap. “We’re not an army. We’re just three boys from Belfast making a bit of art.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/27/basic-human-rights-are-being-rejected-northern-irelands-anti-dup-protest-music\">‘Basic human rights are being rejected’: Northern Ireland’s anti-DUP protest music</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Underscored by a recent UK tour and their booming cross-community fanbase, Kneecap are on a mission to spread the gospel of Gaeilge hip-hop. Their power lies in refusing to march to the beat of inherited bigotry. “Me and our cameraman, went to [Belfast loyalist enclave] Sandy Row [for the infamous 12 July street party],” says Móglaí Bap. “All of a sudden I heard someone singing the hook to CEARTA in Irish. I turned around and suddenly there were like 14 young loyalists singing along. I ended up drinking Buckfast with them. That’s where we’re at. They like to make it out that we’re here to split people up but on the ground, it’s not like that. It’s working-class people that get our craic.”</p> <p>As well as a feature-length black comedy in the works (“We’re doing proper acting classes and everything,” says Móglaí Bap) the trio are working on their full-length debut. “It’s going to be a proper debut with English rappers and different guests that you maybe wouldn’t expect,” says Móglaí Bap. “The prospect of mixing us with some fella from Ladbroke Grove or something is very exciting.”</p> <p>“As for the whole mural thing? It’s all a bit Kneecap ate my hamster,” he adds. “Freddie Starr was a vegetarian and we know where we stand. If people want to find out, they’ll find out.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/19/flashing-lights-iphone-cameras-and-racing-action-the-week-in-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T11:01:50Z","webTitle":"Flashing lights, iPhone cameras and racing action – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/19/flashing-lights-iphone-cameras-and-racing-action-the-week-in-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/19/flashing-lights-iphone-cameras-and-racing-action-the-week-in-art","fields":{"headline":"Flashing lights, iPhone cameras and racing action – the week in art","trailText":"There’s a hallucinatory light show and some ‘Bosno-futurism’ in Edinburgh, Leeds honours its West Indian heritage and Robert Wilson shows ‘filmed portraits’ of movie stars and porcupines ","byline":"Jonathan Jones","body":"<h2>Exhibition of the week</h2> <p><strong>Dreamachine<br></strong>Your own brain creates the colours and shapes you see in this hallucinatory art experience that everyone experiences differently.

And nobody else can tell our story the way we can.” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/17/my-mum-used-to-cook-for-the-wailers-leeds-puts-its-jamaican-history-on-display\">Read the full story here.</a></p> <h2>What we learned </h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/16/demolition-is-an-act-of-violence-the-architects-reworking-buildings-instead-of-tearing-them-down\">Architects are leading a global movement towards ‘creative reuse’</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/18/jean-jacques-sempe-obituary\">Jean-Jacques Sempé, the French cartoonist behind Le Petit Nicolas and many New Yorker covers, has died aged 89</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/17/henry-horenstein-photographer-interview-speedway-1972-americana\">Veteran photographer of Americana Henry Horenstein took inspiration from a surprising source</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gallery/2022/aug/15/best-of-the-iphone-photography-awards-2022-in-pictures\">The annual iPhone Photography award winners were announced</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/15/johnny-depp-to-direct-film-about-italian-painter-amedeo-modigliani-al-pacino\">Johnny Depp is planning a film about Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/15/mvrdv-albania-tirana-skanderbeg-skyscraper-marble-arch-mound\">The Marble Arch Mound architects have moved on to Albania</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/aug/16/lady-gaga-brad-pitt-and-a-porcupine-the-portraits-of-robert-wilson-in-pictures\">Theatre director Robert Wilson is exhibiting his ‘filmed portraits’ of Hollywood stars and porcupines</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/16/trevor-mathison-from-signal-to-decay-volume-1-review\">Trevor Mathison is making music out of a London art gallery</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/aug/16/give-grease-a-chance-inside-an-oily-pittsburgh-factory-in-pictures-gordon-parks\">Robert Parks photographed the oil-workers who fuelled America</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/14/building-a-martian-house-m-shed-bristol-review-tiny-gold-foil-room-on-mars\">Life on Mars will be golden</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e1c4299699e9ddfecf9e83eeb97d0a4d958a800b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1c4299699e9ddfecf9e83eeb97d0a4d958a800b/267_39_4835_3328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Northern Drawbridge to the Citadel in Copenhagen Artist: Christen Købke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Christen Købke: The Northern Drawbridge to the Citadel in Copenhagen (1837)</strong><br>The cold clear pink sky gives what seems at first a carefully realistic scene a dreamlike power. It is as if Købke sees this place perfectly in his mind’s eye but with an electrifying, hallucinatory addition of fantastic light. In fact Købke is depicting his childhood home in a part of Copenhagen that was previously a fortress. For him this drawbridge and these buildings are deeply familiar and meaningful. Just like John Constable, who depicted his “boyhood scenes” all his life, this Danish artist immerses himself in his past to create a curiously intense landscape. His observation slides into abstract colour effects as the strong red of the bridge’s frame doubles the force of the rosy sky while reacting with the green foliage. This is not outer nature but inner fire, a jewel of Romanticism.<br>• <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/christen-kobke-the-northern-drawbridge-to-the-citadel-in-copenhagen\">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Don’t forget</strong></h2> <p>To follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gdnartanddesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@GdnArtandDesign</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email\">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href=\"mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com\">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/19/350-cost-of-living-payment-what-happens-winter-heat-or-eat","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"I got a £350 cost of living payment.

It was a spur of the moment thing. I’ve been working a few extra hours and I thought well, let’s splash out! Literally. We took advantage of the heatwave and sunbathed and all paddled in the sea together. My budget wouldn’t stretch beyond one night at a hotel, but we had a lovely time. That’s probably us done in terms of holidays, to be honest. If I can do some extra hours over the rest of the summer and put away a bit of money, hopefully we’ll be able to go away again for another day in October.</p> <p>I took the kids to a Brewers Fayre for breakfast. We don’t eat out a lot – not surprising really, as a single mum of two kids who works part-time and gets no financial support from either of their dads. I’m all for dads wanting an equal say in the parenting of their kids when they’ve split up from the mums. But that’s got to mean digging into their pockets and paying to bring them up, too. Fat chance of my kids’ dads doing that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/30/single-parent-families-most-exposed-to-cost-of-living-crisis-in-great-britain\">Single-parent families ‘most exposed’ to cost of living crisis in Great Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We booked a table for three and got the buffet. It was a bargain £12 for the three of us, and it was lovely. We filled our boots, then I wrapped three bagels in tissue paper and snuck them into my bag for lunch to save money. I also stuck a load of butters and Nutellas in my handbag. Unfortunately, the butter melted all over my makeup bag in the heat. I was not impressed.</p> <p>Still, the heatwave’s been great for us. I know it’s terrible for the world, but it has meant we’ve not had to have the heating on. We’ve got to be thankful for small mercies.</p> <p>But I’m terrified of what’s coming up next. Inflation of 13%. Fuel bills that are impossible for us to pay. In April, they were talking about energy bills rising to £2,000 a year for a typical family. That was shocking. But now they’re talking about it <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/energy-bills-to-hit-4000-by-january-as-gas-prices-spiral-out-of-control/\">rising to £4,000</a> by the beginning of next year. It’s a nightmare. And the politicians are doing nothing. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss make any number of promises about what they’ll do as prime minister – “I’ll stand on one leg in parliament and fanny my arsehole for six months” – and then they do bugger all.</p> <p>What have we been given to help us? Apparently eight million low-income households are being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61592496\">given £650 to help</a> (provided in two instalments) to help with the cost of living crisis.

Reilly is unemployed and spends most of his days holed up in his bedroom, either contemplating (rarely writing) his literary opus or masturbating, using the memory of a long-dead pet collie to get him in the mood.</p> <p>Toole, who killed himself in 1969 aged 31, wrote A Confederacy of Dunces while doing national service in Puerto Rico in the early 1960s. The book was turned down by successive editors including Robert Gottlieb who, in a letter to the author, wrote that it was “a brilliant exercise in invention … [but] it isn’t really about anything”. After Toole’s death his mother, Thelma, found the manuscript and resolved to get it published. It eventually came out in 1980, became a bestseller, and won Toole a Pulitzer prize.</p> <p>The comic narrator Reginald D Hunter brings new life to a reprobate cast of characters: the cantankerous Claude Robichaux, who believes everyone to be a communist; the doltish police officer, Mancuso, who is the butt of all jokes at his precinct; and the put-upon Irene, who seeks solace in the wine she keeps hidden in the stove. But none compare to the pompous, booming Ignatius, always expostulating about a world he believes has lost its values while overlooking his own idleness. Asked by Mancuso about his lack of employment, he replies, haughtily: “When my brain begins to reel from my literary labours, I make an occasional cheese dip.”</p> <p>• A Confederacy of Dunces is available via Penguin Audio, 12hr 58min</p> <h2>Further listening</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/12/sarah-polley-terry-gilliam-run-towards-danger-baron-munchausen-interview\">Run Towards the Danger</a></strong><br><em>Sarah Polley, W</em><em>F</em><em> Howes</em><em>, 7</em><em>hr 56</em><em>min</em><br>The actor, screenwriter and director narrates a series of autobiographical essays on illness, bereavement and the trauma of starring in Terry Gilliam’s The Adventures of Baron Munchausen at the age of eight.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/the-confession-by-jessie-burton-review\">The Confession</a></strong><br><em>Jessie Burton, </em><em>Macmillan, 11</em><em>hr 53</em><em>min</em><br>This tale about a reclusive novelist and her young amanuensis, from the author of The Miniaturist, is read by the actor Hayley Atwell.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T11:00:09Z","webTitle":"How a top US business lobby promised climate action – but worked to block efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable","fields":{"headline":"How a top US business lobby promised climate action – but worked to block efforts","trailText":"Business Roundtable aims to weaken efforts that would enable investors to hold companies accountable for their climate promises","byline":"Adam Lowenstein","body":"<p>Three years ago today, in a statement that would be described as “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/08/19/business-roundtable-statement-purpose-responsibility/\">historic</a>”, “<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90391743/top-ceo-group-business-roundtable-drops-shareholder-primacy\">monumental</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/10/17/are-companies-rising-to-the-occasion-why-181-ceos-signed-a-revolutionary-corporate-governance-pact/\">revolutionary</a>”, America’s most powerful and politically connected corporations <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans\">promised</a> to “protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses”.</p> <p>The “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation” came from the Business Roundtable, an influential Washington DC lobbying group whose 200-plus members include the chief executives of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Apple, Pepsi, Walmart and Google.</p> <p>Today, on the statement’s third anniversary, the Business Roundtable and its member CEOs continue to issue earnest statements about the climate crisis. But the organization is also working diligently – and spending liberally – to weaken efforts that would enable investors to hold companies accountable for their climate promises.</p> <p>An analysis by the Guardian found the lobby group has worked hard to protect a status quo in which corporations:</p> <ul> <li><p>Generate goodwill and positive PR by publishing bold climate goals, with little fear of being held accountable or legally liable for achieving those goals.</p></li> <li><p>Can choose to selectively disclose certain parts of their carbon footprint, or none at all.</p></li> <li><p>Are not required to reveal the greenhouse gas emissions generated throughout their supply chains – which, for most companies, make up the majority of their emissions.</p></li> <li><p>Make high-profile pledges to fight climate change, while paying to maintain memberships in the Business Roundtable and other trade associations that spend millions of dollars to lobby governments against meaningful climate action.</p></li> </ul> <p>In public the Business Roundtable’s leaders are still committed to change.

In a statement on the group’s website, Mary Barra, the CEO of GM and the Roundtable’s current chair, <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/climate\">declared</a> that “we must act” to tackle climate change. “Meeting the scope of this challenge will require collective global action – business and government,” Barra said.</p> <p>The challenge “isn’t the lack of business commitment” said Johnson Controls CEO George Oliver in a video <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-releases-brt-tv-season-one-episode-four-climate\">published</a> by the Business Roundtable in January. “What we need is to be aligned with the public sector to make sure that we’ve got the proper policies in place that will enable us to do what we do so well.”</p> <p>Yet when the US government has tried to put the “proper policies” in place, the Business Roundtable has worked to undermine those efforts.</p> <p>In 2021, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/01/apple-amazon-microsoft-disney-lobby-groups-climate-bill-analysis\">organization</a> <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2021/11/10/big-business-sharpens-attack-build-back-better\">spent</a> <a href=\"https://popular.info/p/updates-the-corporate-campaign-to\">millions</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/31/business-lobbying-democrats-reconciliation/\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/big-companies-are-funding-campaign-kill-climate-bill/620278/\">dollars</a> <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/climate/brt-gm-microsoft-bbb\">to</a> <a href=\"https://popular.info/p/corporations-versus-the-climate\">stop</a> the Biden administration’s Build Back Better agenda, which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22685920/democrats-infrastructure-build-back-better-climate-change\">included</a> significant efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote clean energy.</p> <p>And this year, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11042.pdf\">proposed</a> a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/21/sec-greenhouse-gas-emissions-carbon-proposal\">long-anticipated</a> rule that would require publicly held companies to disclose their carbon emissions and the risks that climate change poses to their business models, the Business Roundtable declared its opposition to central aspects of the SEC proposal, including provisions that experts say are vital for the rule to give investors comparable and consistent information about corporations’ climate risks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57fa797d1b5e47afc83e8930e8b2c3fba9920604\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57fa797d1b5e47afc83e8930e8b2c3fba9920604/23_0_6697_4023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the New York offices of the financial firm BlackRock in New York, \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a speech last year, ‘If we are really going to tackle this, if we want to have 100% participation, the easiest way you could do that is having unified standards.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before releasing the proposed rules in March, the SEC had <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change-disclosures\">asked</a> the public what such rules might look like. In its response, the Business Roundtable <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12-8906771-244124.pdf\">acknowledged</a> that “climate challenges are creating growing risks in many parts of the economy” and deemed it “appropriate” for the SEC to regulate climate disclosures.</p> <p>The group noted that the present system of corporate climate reporting, in which some companies issue voluntary climate-related disclosures, has proven inadequate. “There are many conflicting demands on companies to provide disclosures under different frameworks, which is unnecessarily costly and time-consuming for companies,” the Business Roundtable’s comments read.</p> <p>But when the SEC shifted from requesting voluntary input to proposing mandatory requirements for climate disclosures, the organization appeared to change its tune. In a 17-page letter, the CEO lobby <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022-20132191-302705.pdf\">announced</a> its opposition to the proposal and <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-urges-sec-to-revise-climate-disclosure-rule\">asked</a> the commission to “revise and repropose the rule.”</p> <p>In an email to the Guardian, the Business Roundtable denied that its perspective had changed. “[Business Roundtable] members are committed to combating climate change and are supportive of a rulemaking. Our goal is for a pragmatic, attainable, and successful rule,” the group said. “Our members believe it is worth the extra time on the front end to repropose the rule.”</p> <p>Since April 2021, according to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12-8695299-236184.pdf\">meeting</a> <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12-8855722-238504.pdf\">memoranda</a> <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022-20132714-303203.pdf\">published</a> by the SEC, the Business Roundtable has met at least three times with the SEC about climate disclosures. (GM’s Barra, the chair of the Business Roundtable, also <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022-20129715-296002.pdf\">met</a> separately with SEC chair Gary Gensler.)</p> <p>In the first half of this year, the group <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/reports?cycle=2022&amp;id=D000032202\">spent</a> more than $9.1m lobbying the federal government directly, according to reports compiled by Open Secrets. In its public disclosures, the Roundtable <a href=\"https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/86980775-2940-4b00-a39d-c6624db22a0f/print/\">reported</a> <a href=\"https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/847be59a-b742-4215-8f04-4edefacb2368/print/\">lobbying</a> Congress, the White House and the SEC about the climate disclosure proposal. (In an email, the Business Roundtable said it “met with the SEC to directly communicate our concerns” and “shared our point of view with members of Congress and administration officials.”)</p> <p>Despite asking for a new, and thus delayed, proposal, the organization’s own members <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/a-call-to-action-from-the-global-business-community-global-businesses-support-climate-action-that-enhances-competitiveness\">continue</a> <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/\">to</a> <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-third-decade-climate-action-realizing-carbon-free-future\">assure</a> <a href=\"https://bizroundtable.medium.com/the-purpose-of-a-corporation-on-its-second-birthday-65fd945f6bbf\">the</a> <a href=\"https://bizroundtable.medium.com/business-government-partnership-remains-key-to-tackling-climate-change-d0ad4ed961ba\">public</a> that they see the climate crisis as an urgent challenge. “We’re out of time,” Cummins CEO and Business Roundtable member Tom Linebarger said in the organization’s January climate video. “We’re getting ready, to get ready, to get ready to do things. And the problem is that we have to move now.”</p> <p>But “now”, it seems, does not mean <em>now</em>.</p> <p>One provision the Business Roundtable has rejected as “unworkable” is a requirement for companies to measure and report the greenhouse gas emissions generated by suppliers and customers throughout their supply chains, or what are <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#description\">known</a> as “Scope 3” emissions. The provision would apply only to companies that have published emissions targets that include Scope 3, or for which supply-chain emissions are considered “<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf\">material</a>”.</p> <p>Scope 3 <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Scope3emissions-diagram-1200px.png\">includes</a> <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1103144/the-secs-proposed-climate-disclosure-rule-not-quite-as-easy-as-scope-1-2-3\">all</a> greenhouse gas emissions that companies neither generate directly (Scope 1) nor purchase for their own energy needs (Scope 2), which means everything from the raw materials that go into creating a product to the transportation that delivers that product to a consumer.</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2022/3/8/sec-climate-disclosure-rulemaking\">most companies</a>, Scope 3 emissions <a href=\"https://newclimate.org/resources/publications/corporate-climate-responsibility-monitor-2022\">represent</a> the majority of their carbon output. As Addisu Lashitew, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, has pointed out, more than three-quarters of Amazon’s 2021 <a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2021-sustainability-report.pdf\">emissions</a> were considered Scope 3.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/scope3/giv-6562LT7CjswSxnhb/\" data-alt=\"Diagram showing Scope 3 emissions are everything indirectly related to production\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/scope3/giv-6562LT7CjswSxnhb/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The Business Roundtable <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-responds-to-sec-request-for-input-on-climate-disclosures\">supports</a> mandating Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions disclosures, and many companies already report them, in part because these direct emissions are easier to calculate and easier to reduce (sometimes through the purchase of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-02/now-is-your-chance-to-fix-the-carbon-offset-market\">dubious</a> <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/\">carbon</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/04/carbon-offsets-used-by-major-airlines-based-on-flawed-system-warn-experts\">“offsets”</a>).</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly, however, because most firms’ emissions are primarily Scope 3, limiting their reporting to Scopes 1 and 2 makes them appear greener.</p> <p>In its comments to the SEC, the Business Roundtable called the proposal to require companies to measure and report Scope 3 emissions “overly burdensome” because “many companies still have limited systems in place to identify and disclose Scope 3 emissions” and some aspects of reporting value-chain emissions “remain[] challenging”.</p> <p>But “if you don’t have Scope 3 as a requirement, then what you have effectively done is cut out most of the emissions from the top-emitting industries,” Allison Herren Lee, the former acting chair and commissioner of the SEC, told the Guardian. “With emissions arguably being the most important item of disclosure for investors, how is a rule without Scope 3 going to achieve what investors need?”</p> <p>“There is an inherent degree of uncertainty in some of the data the proposal would require companies to disclose, and much of it is largely outside their control,” the Business Roundtable said in an email.</p> <p>A number of experts familiar with the SEC’s climate disclosure rulemaking acknowledged that tracking and reporting Scope 3 emissions could indeed be difficult for some companies, or at least more difficult than not doing so.</p> <p>But they suggested that the more fundamental question was not whether complying with the SEC’s rules would be more difficult than doing nothing, but rather if doing so would provide investors with information that they have requested and that would help them make more informed investment decisions.</p> <p>This argument would appear to align with the stated position of the Business Roundtable, which <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/Business_Roundtable_Energy_Policy_Roadmap_Apr2022.pdf\">has</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/climate\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/Business-RoundtableAddressingClimateChangeReport.September2020.pdf\">expressed</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BizRoundtable/status/1306207716327723008\">its</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/business-roundtable-endorse-market-based-climate-policy-415804\">support</a> for “market-based” efforts to address climate change, a view it reiterated in its comments to the SEC.</p> <p>“Information is the lifeblood of the capital markets, and capital markets are a central institution of a capitalist market economy,” George S Georgiev, a professor at Emory University and an expert on securities law, told the Guardian. “Climate-related financial information is demanded by investors, not by environmentalists.”</p> <p>Moreover, “there is no unanimity that Scope 3 reporting is problematic”, Georgiev said, noting that Apple, whose CEO, Tim Cook, <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/about-us/board-of-directors\">sits</a> on the Business Roundtable’s board of directors, is among the companies that have endorsed the SEC’s Scope 3 requirement. Apple’s existing reporting “attest[s] to the feasibility of reasonably modeling, measuring, and reporting on all three scopes of emissions, including scope 3 emissions,” the company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12-8915594-244828.pdf\">told</a> the Commission.</p> <p>In its comments, the Business Roundtable said that its member companies had already set a “high bar…for voluntary ESG [environmental, social and governance] disclosures,” and that a voluntary approach to climate reporting was already “providing more valuable information for investors”.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3233053\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-ceres-investor-briefing-041222#_ftnref6\">investors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD690.pdf\">analysts</a>, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2022/02/we-need-universal-esg-accounting-standards\">academics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/8/2/voters-want-companies-to-improve-transparency-around-their-climate-emissions\">voters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9bdd50c-f669-3f9c-a5f4-c2cf531a35b5\">experts</a> – <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/comments/climate-disclosure/cll12-8731000-237041b.pdf\">even</a> <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1103144/the-secs-proposed-climate-disclosure-rule-not-quite-as-easy-as-scope-1-2-3\">companies</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/standardizing-esg-criteria-will-reduce-confusion-sp-global-ceo.html\">themselves</a> – disagree. “There is near-universal agreement among scholars that voluntary disclosure rules alone are not sufficient,” Emory’s Georgiev said. “The same logic applies to climate rules.”</p> <p>“Climate is one of the most significant risks facing companies and investors,” said Danielle Fugere, the president and chief counsel of As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy nonprofit. “For companies to say that it is too costly to gather Scope 1 through 3 data, we simply think that it shows signs of weak management.”</p> <p>In a March <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/aoa4f52ok2i4t06/Letter%20to%20SEC_Climate%20Disclosure%20Rule.pdf?dl=0\">letter</a>, a group of investors managing nearly $5tn of assets <a href=\"https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2022/3/8/sec-climate-disclosure-rulemaking\">warned</a> that failing to require companies to disclose their Scope 3 emissions would render the SEC rules doubly ineffective: insufficient for addressing the climate emergency, and inadequate for providing investors with useful information, because voluntary figures allow companies to publish only the information that paints them in the best light.</p> <p>“There is a great amount of confusion,” Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/events/climate-change-and-financial-market-regulations-insights-from-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-and-former-sec-chair-mary-schapiro/\">said</a> in a speech last year. “If we are really going to tackle this, if we want to have 100% participation, the easiest way you could do that is having unified standards.” Fink is also a member of the Business Roundtable.</p> <p>In an email, the Roundtable said it was “unlikely” that the proposed Scope 3 disclosure provisions “would result in comparable, investor-useful information”. The group “believes it’s important to have reliable climate risk and emissions data, and our companies are leaders when it comes to transparency.”</p> <p>The group’s objections to the SEC’s Scope 3 requirements are only one aspect of its multi-tiered opposition to the proposed climate disclosure rules. And its opposition to the proposed rules is, similarly, only one example of many in which it has rejected efforts to hold its member companies accountable for their social and environmental pledges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d005c175d77c31a639975567ae935d1f1e643571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d005c175d77c31a639975567ae935d1f1e643571/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New vehicles sit in a lot in front of the idled General Motors Co at an assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, in 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New vehicles sit in a lot in front of the idled General Motors Co at an assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the three years since the organization released the “purpose of a corporation” statement, a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/companies-stand-solidarity-are-licensing-themselves-discriminate/614947/\">number</a> <a href=\"https://www.kksadvisors.com/tcp-test-of-corporate-purpose-september2020\">of</a> <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3544978\">studies</a> have shown that Business Roundtable companies have failed to follow through on their “fundamental commitment to all of [their] stakeholders”.</p> <p>One analysis from London Business School and Columbia Business School <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3609056\">found</a> that companies whose CEOs signed the 2019 statement subsequently received more federal environmental infractions and had higher carbon emissions than similar firms that did not sign the statement.</p> <p>In another study, two Harvard Law School professors <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3899421\">reviewed</a> more than 600 public documents filed by Business Roundtable companies since the statement’s publication. Time and time again, the researchers found that when firms were presented with an opportunity to formalize the pledge in their corporate governance, they declined.</p> <p>In addition, by advocating and lobbying against government action on issues like climate change, the Business Roundtable gives its members space to publicly endorse (and claim credit for endorsing) legislative and regulatory action – such as Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/climate/climate-tech-stock-index\">support</a> for mandatory Scope 3 reporting, or Cummins and GM’s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-companies-sit-out-the-fight-over-democrats-tax-increases-11636367400\">support</a> for Build Back Better –all while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/01/apple-amazon-microsoft-disney-lobby-groups-climate-bill-analysis\">knowing</a> that the Roundtable will work behind the scenes in opposition.</p> <p>“Some individual companies aren’t going to write in and rage against the proposal because they know that will raise concerns with their investors, so they let some of the trade groups do that work for them,” said Allison Herren Lee, the SEC’s former acting chair and commissioner.</p> <p>In its comments to the SEC, the Business Roundtable urged lawmakers to take the lead on tackling the climate crisis, arguing that “although important, disclosures simply will not solve the problem”.</p> <p>“These are complex issues that need to be solved through the legislative process,” the group wrote.</p> <p>But the Business Roundtable continues to oppose efforts to address the climate emergency through the legislative process. The latest effort to tackle the climate crisis, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/biden-signs-inflation-reduction-act-landmark-healthcare-climate-bill\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/business/dealbook/inflation-reduction-act-analysis.html\">includes</a> billions of dollars in clean energy tax incentives, paid for in part by making sure corporations pay at least a 15% tax rate on profits.

Since his first major TV role, a bit-part in the mid-90s police drama Backup, he has appeared in pretty much everything going. He was in The Bill. He was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/29/like-walking-into-hell-casualty-and-holby-city-tap-into-the-covid-crisis\">Casualty</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who\">Doctor Who</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/18/death-by-boiled-egg-why-midsomer-murders-is-a-lockdown-delight\">Midsomer Murders</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/07/death-in-paradise-review-its-no-luther-and-thank-heavens-for-that\">Death in Paradise</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/02/line-of-duty-review-an-audacious-deranged-reverse-ferreting-finale\">Line of Duty</a>. It’s a Sin.</p> <p>To see Toussaint’s face appear on screen is to go: “Oh hey, that guy,” safe in the knowledge that you’re in good hands. And yet the man himself is a mystery. He has fewer than 2,000 Twitter followers. His <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Toussaint\" title=\"\">Wikipedia entry</a> lists only his year of birth and his professional output. In an age when everyone knows everything about everyone, he’s a complete enigma.</p> <p>But that might be about to change. This week sees the launch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/05/game-of-thrones-prequel-why-well-all-be-hooked-to-house-of-the-dragon\">House of the Dragon</a>, HBO’s long-awaited Game of Thrones prequel. It will, one suspects, very quickly become the biggest show on television. And Steve Toussaint happens to play Corlys Velaryon, one of its leads. What’s more, as one of the few Black actors in the show (and more about that later), spending every scene bearded in a huge, grey, dreadlocked wig, his presence is felt even more keenly. As such, when I chat to him over Zoom from his home in north London – positioned in front of a giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/11/pam-grier-quentin-tarantino-blaxploitation\">Pam Grier poster</a> – it’s hard to shake the feeling that this will be the last interview that Steve Toussaint will ever give with his civilian status intact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"293b42af946946e5186cbd7eb917a75df3f31870\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/293b42af946946e5186cbd7eb917a75df3f31870/11_78_1909_1145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Toussaint as Lord Corlys Velaryon in House of the Dragon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Toussaint as Lord Corlys Velaryon in House of the Dragon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has already had a taste of what his future might look like, since House of the Dragon had the rare distinction of being A Big Thing since the moment it was announced. And that meant filming the series (in Leavesden in Hertfordshire, Cornwall, Portugal and Spain) had to take place in a vacuum of total secrecy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/house-of-the-dragon-review-game-of-thrones-prequel-got\">House of the Dragon first look review – this epic Game of Thrones prequel is a roaring success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Our code name was Red Gun,” he reveals with a kind of bemused glee. “When we first went down to Cornwall, during the second or third week of shooting, our faces and costumes had to be covered in these black cloaks. We were like: ‘No one cares,’ but then the next day in the Daily Mail there were these photos of us on the beach. We realised: ‘Oh wow, no, this is a bigger deal than we thought.’”</p> <p>Was the scale of the potential viewership something he had to grapple with while filming? He shakes his head. “The job doesn’t change, whatever else is out there. We still have to learn the lines, look into each other’s eyes and try and be convincing. You can’t really play to people’s expectations. And the fact is, when they started announcing our casting, there were an awful lot of people who were quite keen to let us know what they thought. So, either the positive or the negative, you can’t really let it affect how you do the job.”</p> <p>Yes, about that. When George RR Martin first wrote the character of Corlys Velaryon, he was a middle-aged white man. So, when news emerged that he would be played on television by a Black actor, it caused the worst fringes of the internet to heap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/16/steve-toussaint-reveals-racist-abuse-after-being-cast-in-house-of-the-dragon\" title=\"\">racist abuse</a> on Toussaint. This is something he’s spoken about in the past, and you sense he doesn’t necessarily want it to be the defining aspect of his role, but there was something grimly inevitable about the reaction. After all, the same toxic fandom went after John Boyega when he was cast in Star Wars, and Moses Ingram when she appeared on Obi-Wan Kenobi. Was he briefed about how to handle all the negative attention?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DotnJ7tTA34\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DotnJ7tTA34?start=4&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>“No, no, we had no idea,” he says. “When my first photo came out on Twitter it was: ‘Oh, wow, this?’</p> <p>“But it’s been so interesting,” he continues. “I mentioned this the other day to my white friends, and they were all like: ‘Oh my God!’ But when I mentioned it to my friends of colour, they were like: ‘Well, we knew that was coming,’ you know? We were just: ‘I wonder how long it will take?’ And it was <em>minutes</em>. None of us were surprised.”</p> <p>It’s so weird that this sort of racist abuse tends to primarily happen in the world of fantasy and sci-fi, I tell him. He probably didn’t encounter it after he was cast in, say, Line of Duty. “It’s funny, because you go: ‘You don’t have a problem with flying dragons, but a Black guy who’s a nobleman?’” he scowls. “But I don’t hate. Listen, those people are best left to themselves. To those things.”</p> <p>Born in Birmingham in 1965 to Barbadian parents, before moving to south-east London – his father worked on the London Underground and his mother was a nurse – Toussaint had a long and circuitous route to acting. While studying politics at the University of Sussex, someone offered him a role in a play. “He said: ‘Look, the lead in this play is this conceited guy. He’s arrogant. He thinks he’s God’s gift to women. You’d be great,’” he recalls. “And I was like: ‘Thank you, I think?’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be05b81677d948d2033fa3f7dcae836027933a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be05b81677d948d2033fa3f7dcae836027933a62/4_12_1909_1145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Toussaint: ‘I get to wear this huge wig.

I’ll be fine’<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After graduating, Toussaint enjoyed spells in merchant banking and hospital administration before deciding to give acting another crack. “I rang up drama schools,” he explains. “And I told them: ‘Look, I’d love to come and audition.’ And they said: ‘Great, bring your cheque.’ I was like: ‘What, you have to pay? Will I get the money back if I don’t get in?’ And they laughed. I thought: ‘That’s a racket,’ so I did evening classes instead.” This quickly led to his first paid role, as the Genie in panto in Bromley.</p> <p>Three decades later, he has become an integral part of the biggest show of the year. The likelihood of him becoming a household name is increased by the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/house-of-the-dragon-review-game-of-thrones-prequel-got\">House of the Dragon is very, very good</a>. Taking place two centuries before Game of Thrones, it’s a smaller story about a power struggle within House Targaryen. The narrowed focus allows for deeper storytelling and, if the first episode is any indication, it has the potential to be spectacularly intense. Which is good because, as I tell Toussaint, I was getting worried that it would be crap.</p> <p>“When we started, the one thing that [showrunners] Ryan [Condal] and Miguel [Sapochnik] kept saying was that we can’t continue making Game of Thrones, because Game of Thrones did that extremely well,” he replies. “So we’re trying to do something that’s recognisably the same world, but a different story. You get to concentrate a bit more on each character, so that when things develop later on you’re a little bit more invested – because you’ve spent some time with them.”</p> <p>A second season of House of the Dragon has yet to be officially commissioned. But that seems a formality, I posit, since a show like this is too big to fail. At this point, Toussaint pulls a bit of a face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa0f139366c24ff694dc90614ed409a482ad2d9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa0f139366c24ff694dc90614ed409a482ad2d9a/80_623_3247_4058/800.jpg\" alt=\"Toussaint at House of Dragon premiere in London.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toussaint at House of Dragon premiere in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“At a meeting for a Steve McQueen thing I did a couple of years ago, I bumped into a lovely actress who had made a pilot for a Game of Thrones spin-off,” he recalls by way of explanation. “I said to her: ‘Oh my God, I’d love to be in that.’ She goes: ‘Well, don’t worry, when it goes –<em> when</em> it goes – there’ll be lots of great parts.” However, that spin-off turned out to be Bloodmoon, a notoriously expensive experiment that HBO filmed before panicking and hiding it away from the world for ever. “And they had spent somewhere like $30m on that,” Toussaint says. “I’d love to believe that something’s too big to fail, but nothing is.”</p> <p>You sense this level-headedness has been hard-won over the course of a career full of false dawns. Towards the end of our chat, I reinforce what I have decided will be the theme of the interview: that he is about to become very famous indeed. As a parting shot, I ask how that must feel.</p> <p>“Generally, I’m quite sanguine, to be honest,” he replies. “When I first started, there were many things that I thought would change everything. The first time I was at the RSC, the first time I was at the National, the first time I was on TV. At the premiere of Prince of Persia, a couple of producers said to me [affecting the voice of a cigar-chomping Hollywood type]: ‘We’re going to make a lot of these, and you’re going to be in them all, because you’re fucking amazing.’ And then, of course, it didn’t make the money that they wanted, and that was the end of it. I did a pilot in the States years ago, and CBS were like: ‘We’re your friends at CBS! We want you to be part of us,’ and then the show didn’t get picked up. So I’m just enjoying today, right? I decided a long time ago, I’m not gonna spend my time looking over there. If it does well, and people like what I do, fabulous. If it doesn’t do so well? Well, I still had a great time making it and I met some lovely people.”</p> <p>And as for the prospect of his life changing? He wouldn’t be so sure. He starts naming a procession of his younger, photogenic new castmates. “Those guys?” he laughs. “The young, sexy guys? <em>Their</em> lives are going to change. I get to wear this huge wig and a big beard. I’m going to be fine.”</p> <p> • This article was amended on 19 August 2022<strong>.</strong> Toussaint was born in Birmingham, not south-east London as an earlier version said.</p> <p><br></p> <p><em>House of the Dragon starts </em><em>22 August</em><em>, 9pm, Sky Atlantic</em></p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/19/updown-betteshanger-deal-kent-restaurant-review-grace-dent","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T11:00:09Z","webTitle":"Updown, near Deal, Kent: ‘They make you lunch and sell you a fantasy’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/19/updown-betteshanger-deal-kent-restaurant-review-grace-dent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/19/updown-betteshanger-deal-kent-restaurant-review-grace-dent","fields":{"headline":"Updown, Kent: ‘They make you lunch and sell you a fantasy’ – restaurant review","trailText":"One of those places that shows how life could be – classy but understated","byline":"Grace Dent","body":"<p><a href=\"https://updownfarmhouse.com/\">Updown</a>, near Deal in Kent, is feasibly that scene you have in your mind’s eye whenever you imagine escaping to the country, taking on a rambling, 17th-century farmhouse in need of lots of TLC and living the dream. A dream being as far as such things go for most sane people, after weighing up the costs, the sacrifices and the ever-present danger of a visit from a fractious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/13/kevin-mccloud-would-never-spend-on-a-kitchen-grand-designs\">Kevin “McLoud”</a>.</p> <p>Occasionally, however, people do make that leap, and something magical happens. Updown, by Ruth Leigh and Oli Brown, is set in seven-and-a-half acres, with well-tended walled gardens and, now, a restaurant with seven rooms for overnight stays. Presently, there’s only an outdoor dining area with a pergola, meaning you can eat john dory with samphire or pork chop with fennel gratin among the butterflies. Next year, however, an indoor space will open in the barn. Updown, which was bought and renovated over lockdown, is deeply antagonistic to those of us who can barely change a lightbulb, because somehow Leigh and Brown have taken this Grade II-listed building and created one of those quintessentially British, rural settings that matches how American screenwriters believe we all live: endless days perusing dusty, arty tomes in our boldly painted libraries, padding about in our bohemian country piles, wellies at the back door, before lunching on a plate of local radishes with sea salt and butter and a glass of cloudy, homemade lemonade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc796cdb352b1396930a32594f8dd520cfe41d3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc796cdb352b1396930a32594f8dd520cfe41d3f/0_0_5409_8109/667.jpg\" alt=\"‘Very fine’: Updown Farmhouse’s buffalo mozzarella with braised courgettes.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Very fine’: Updown’s buffalo mozzarella with braised courgettes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holly Farrier/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I didn’t drink that, by the way – I chose a <a href=\"https://crodino.com/en-uk/\">Crodino</a>, which is possibly the most elegant, delicious, non-alcoholic aperitif in existence: it’s a vivid orange, sweet, herbal, Italian drink that comes in a classy little bottle. It’s rarely available in the UK, so of course they have it at Updown, just casually sitting there on the menu, alongside the chilled eau de vie de poire and vodka martinis that they serve with a smoked eel gilda; they also do <a href=\"https://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/beer/whitstable-bay-blonde-lager\">Whitstable Bay Blonde lager</a> and chilled organic Clos Des Trois Sources rosé at £9 a glass.</p> <p>Chef Oli previously founded <a href=\"https://www.olivemagazine.com/restaurants/duck-duck-goose-london-restaurant-review/\">Duck Duck Goose</a> in Brixton after working with the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/rowley-leigh\">Rowley Leigh</a> at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jan/05/restaurants.restaurants\">Le Café Anglais</a>, while front-of-house Ruth (who just happens to be Leigh’s daughter) has worked with highly respected restaurateurs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevie-parle\">Stevie Parle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Article/2017/10/06/Chef-Henry-Harris-on-life-after-Racine-pub-food-knives-and-French-cooking\">Henry Harris</a>. Updown, regardless of how casually off-the-cuff it seems, is no flimsy operation. The vibe is intensely relaxed, but service is well drilled and attentive, staffed by local young people who restore faith in the whole notion of British hospitality. Lord knows where Brown and Leigh found these chipper, clever, non-obtrusive but ever-present types in freshly pressed shirts, but they’ve hit gold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66d05f3eaf8b6b21d861734b09b4c19cdc3d2d16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66d05f3eaf8b6b21d861734b09b4c19cdc3d2d16/0_0_7139_4762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Perilously simple’: Updown’s peach and tomato salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Perilously simple’: Updown’s peach and tomato salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holly Farrier/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, all this would be worth nothing if the food was lacklustre, but it’s good. <em>Extremely</em> good. The menu is brief and ever-changing, cooking whatever is local, fresh and seasonal over an outdoor wood fire. On the Sunday we visited, there was a plate of excellent ripe tomatoes served with equally juicy peaches and basil, which, when written down like that, sounds both perilously simple and possibly unpleasant, but that is the alchemy of using the best ingredients. Suddenly, it all makes sense. The same goes for a bowl of courgettes, sauteed until almost collapsing, with a soft, pale ball of fine mozzarella. Main courses included a Sunday roast of lamb with just-podded broad beans and tempura courgette and a side of baby potatoes with grilled endive. For vegetarians, there was a ferociously portioned plate of roast celeriac, girolles and tomatoes with thick, green, luscious pesto and excellent olive oil, though the star of that particular show was an abundance of large, soft chickpeas prepared with love and care. Presentation is unfussy, and at times even delightfully clumsy, because it is all about the flavours.</p> <p>Pudding was a choice between an indecently boozy baba with crimson cherries backstroking for their lives in a sea of rum and flanked by chantilly cream, and truffled Baron Bigod cheese with walnuts and honey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa9b375e41840022669b46c39621ea239a6c89fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa9b375e41840022669b46c39621ea239a6c89fe/0_528_5305_7425/714.jpg\" alt=\"‘Indecently boozy’: Updown Farmhouse’s rum baba.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Indecently boozy’: Updown’s rum baba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holly Farrier/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Updown hasn’t really got going yet, so I’m possibly jumping the gun by even discussing it now, but I have a hunch that diners will quickly warm to it, and that bookings to sit in the barn, once it’s up and running, will be buoyant. This is one of those places that shows how life could be lived – so long as you’re someone who has their act together. You’d be classy but understated, living a rustic existence in seven or so acres with its own wildflower garden, and existing on good, simple produce.</p> <p>That’s the brilliant thing about the very best restaurants: they make you lunch and sell you a fantasy. At Updown, while you personally may not be to the manor born, from noon until late afternoon, you can sit back, drink gingerella and eat octopus salad in the sunshine, and, for a few short hours at least, it feels very much as if you are.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://updownfarmhouse.com/\">Updown</a>, Updown Road, Betteshanger, near Deal, Kent, 01304 784410.

The ghosts of Graham Greene’s world-weary expat protagonists hover over jaded but shrewd Brit Adrian Gyle, who is reconciled to the fact that both his ambition and his career have stalled. Jimmy Tang, his feckless friend from Cambridge, whose wealthy family pays expedient lip service to Beijing, offers him glimpses of the high life – literally, because his mansion on the steep hillsides of the affluent Mid-Levels looks down on the street fighting and tear gas clouds below. When Rebecca To, a young activist with whom Jimmy is having an affair, vanishes, Adrian attempts to solve the mystery. Osborne wisely resists any pat answers in a whodunnit wrapped in a superbly atmospheric portrait both of a particular place and time, and of the creation and destruction of a friendship. Highly recommended.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3263efe8fe61e04d742f930f73d33a1a8ad20567\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3263efe8fe61e04d742f930f73d33a1a8ad20567/0_0_329_499/329.jpg\" alt=\"Meantime by Frankie Boyle;\" width=\"329\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/meantime-9781399801157\" title=\"\">Meantime</a> by Frankie Boyle (John Murray, £14.99)</strong><br>The colonial past also affects the present in Frankie Boyle’s first novel, which is set in Glasgow during the aftermath of the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. Yes, it’s another crime novel by a white male celebrity – but there’s nothing cosy about Meantime, even though it’s nowhere near as misanthropic as its author’s comedic reputation might suggest. Junkie Felix McAveety is trying to solve the murder of his best friend Marina with the assistance of neighbour and fellow partaker Donnie and cop-turned-crime-novelist Jane. The trio soon find themselves mired in a world of nationalist politics, spies, drug dealers, stalkers and artificial intelligence. The plot, which admittedly gets pretty daft, takes second place to scathing social commentary, with pot shots at everything from capitalism and liberalism to Scotland itself. Despite his reliance on mind-altering substances and tendency to gob off (if you’re familiar with Boyle, you’ll hear him in your head), Felix is a man of integrity, and his story is not only funny, but moving as well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c69a2bbc1612a3f11e8c536587f9fefd828d0561\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c69a2bbc1612a3f11e8c536587f9fefd828d0561/0_0_1853_2835/654.jpg\" alt=\"Alias Emma\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/alias-emma-9781529135886\" title=\"\">Alias Emma</a> by Ava Glass (Cornerstone, £14.99)</strong><br>This debut novel for adults from YA author CJ Daugherty, writing under a pseudonym, is the first in a projected series featuring British intelligence agent Emma Makepeace. Following a spate of murders of dissident scientists by the Russian military intelligence service GRU, she is tasked by Ripley, her boss at “the Agency”, to escort Michael, the son of two of MI6’s biggest assets, nuclear physicists Dimitri and Elena Primalov, across London to safety. This is Emma’s first big assignment, and it’s a lot less easy than it appears because the GRU have hacked into the capital’s extensive CCTV network. The pair are forced to travel on foot, and the Russians have eyes – and hit squads – everywhere. Emma is an appealing character, smart and resourceful, and Glass deftly works her backstory into this high-octane, warp-speed thriller without missing a beat.

Set on the New York State coastline, this is the tale of three women who discover that the menopause has given them special powers. Harriett, divorcee and former ad exec, connects with nature, in particular her ability to cultivate poisonous plants; businesswoman Jo learns to channel her fury into an impressive weapon; and widow Nessa, alone now her daughters are at college, begins to see the ghosts of murdered women. When the trio investigate the suspicious deaths of three teenage girls, it becomes clear that the perpetrator is someone that society values far more highly than the victims. With a propulsive plot and characters that roar off the page, this is a novel that’s unafraid to take on societal misogyny while being satirical and even funny at the same time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c2a8d5553ea3217fd3b334ce7b63a7b9f9bd7ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c2a8d5553ea3217fd3b334ce7b63a7b9f9bd7ae/0_0_311_500/311.jpg\" alt=\"Hawk Mountain by Conner Habib\" width=\"311\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/hawk-mountain-a-novel-9780393542172?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Hawk Mountain</a> by Conner Habib (WW Norton &amp; Co, £19.99)</strong><br>Masculinity is in crisis in this unsettling debut novel from podcast host Habib. New England teacher Todd’s wife departed after a few years of lacklustre marriage, leaving him to parent toddler Anthony alone. When the boy is six, the pair have an apparently chance meeting with Jack, who bullied Todd remorselessly at school 15 years earlier but now seems overjoyed to see him. Despite Todd’s reluctance, Jack gradually insinuates himself into their lives, and winds up sleeping on their sofa. Repressed and conflicted, Todd is as much afraid of his own feelings as he is of his erstwhile tormentor, and the resurfacing of things he’s buried deep inside has appalling consequences. Habib ramps up the paranoia to Highsmithian levels, while flashbacks to the boys’ schooldays show how the seeds of destruction were sown.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/jeremy-vine-cycle-safety-london-helmet-cam","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T10:55:08Z","webTitle":"‘It’s not a political thing’: Jeremy Vine on cycle safety – and that helmet cam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/jeremy-vine-cycle-safety-london-helmet-cam","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/jeremy-vine-cycle-safety-london-helmet-cam","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s not a political thing’: Jeremy Vine on cycle safety – and that helmet cam","trailText":"While riding around London, the BBC presenter talks about the dangers and benefits of getting about on two wheels","byline":"Peter Walker","body":"<p>Cycling along a busy one-way street in central London, followed by a black Mercedes and a line of other cars, Jeremy Vine ponders how best to stay safe: move a bit closer to the side, allowing room for a potentially close overtake, or stick to the centre of the lane?</p> \n<p>“It’s a bit of a conundrum,” he admits. “Let’s take the primary position and see if we get any argy-bargy. Think of it as an experiment.”</p> \n<p>As we pedal along, the Mercedes driver stays yards behind, making no effort to squeeze past or even edge closer. “This guy behind us is being lovely,” Vine grins. “We shouldn’t always paint cycling as dangerous. The most dangerous thing you can do is to always be on your sofa, eating Pringles.”</p> \n<p>Vine remains best known for a lunchtime show on BBC Radio 2, and his eponymous morning TV programme on Channel 5. But if you follow the presenter on Twitter, you might be forgiven for thinking his main job is, in fact, the journeys he makes between them.</p> \n<p>While quite a few cyclists post clips from on-bike video cameras to highlight dangerous driving, in the past couple of years Vine has taken this concept forward in several ways.</p> \n<p>To begin with, he doesn’t just post unadorned clips. Vine’s contributions are micro-documentaries, adding explanatory graphics, music and rewound footage to show different angles, something possible because of the hi-tech 360-degree camera he uses, perched atop his helmet.</p> \n<p>While many of the videos show instances of bad driving – Vine has passed about 15 of the most egregious examples to the police – he also posts vignettes of uplifting interactions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theJeremyVine/status/1543279835698679809\">with drivers</a> and other cyclists, and once sent a case of beer to a truck driver who had been particularly considerate. His <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theJeremyVine/status/1558392621185343495\">most recent video</a> highlighted how he failed to see some pedestrians trying to use a zebra crossing as he shot past.</p> \n<p>“People say ‘Why do you film it?’, and the answer is, sometimes I want to look back and see what I’ve done wrong. When I approached a junction and felt unsafe, was I in the wrong place?” he explains.</p> \n<p>Vine, 57, says he began cycling after becoming “fatter and sadder” in his mid-40s, and realising the gym was not the answer when he had visited just once in a year of membership – to use the whirlpool bath.</p> \n<p>He now rides 15 miles each weekday to, from and between his jobs, and is again slim and in obvious, vigorous good health. “It’s all you need to stay fit,” he says. “As someone brilliantly said, the bike is a flying machine powered by muffins. There is just the risk of sudden death. And that’s what began to make me more assertive about safety.”</p> \n<p>Vine began cycling with what he now terms “a ‘kumbaya’ attitude – let’s just all be friends”, but eventually concluded he had to start using a video camera. “I thought, I need to properly try to understand what’s putting me at risk and take whatever measures I can. For me, that was enforcement. I think that in the end, bad drivers respond to enforcement.”</p> \n<p>This aspect of his cycling gained prominence in 2017 when a driver who beeped her horn and shouted abuse at Vine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/01/driver-abuse-jeremy-vine-convicted-road-rage-shanique-syrena-pearson\">was convicted</a> of threatening behaviour and a driving offence. A video of the incident he posted to Facebook was viewed more than 15m times.</p> \n<p>I join Vine for the final leg of one weekday commute, from the BBC radio studios in central London, heading west towards his home. An easily recognisable figure in his bright yellow gloves and camera-topped helmet, Vine is often spotted by other riders, and increasingly, he says, by drivers. “I got a cab driver saying: ‘I’m not coming anywhere near you, because I know who you are.’ I thought, that’s maybe good.”</p> \n<p>Our experiment with the courteously driven Mercedes comes just beyond the BBC studios, on a stretch of one-way street where, Vine says, he has regularly faced danger, highlighting his much-stated belief that the only way to improve cycle safety is to create better road infrastructure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da53ccf072c16b4a2d83d166ca26f3b3b34da0ac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da53ccf072c16b4a2d83d166ca26f3b3b34da0ac/0_0_3826_2078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Walker and Vine negotiate the streets of central London with other road users.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"543\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walker and Vine negotiate the streets of central London with other road users.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Vine</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It can’t just be a coincidence that all the bad drivers end in places like this,” he says, as we ride farther west. “It’s bad roads and bad drivers coming together. That’s clearly the thing.”</p> \n<p>Unfortunately for Vine, while one part of his commute, Hammersmith Broadway, now has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theJeremyVine/status/1552354809411420160\">a separated bike lane</a>, one installed on another section, Kensington High Street, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/30/kensington-and-chelsea-council-criticised-for-scrapping-cycle-lane\">removed by the local council</a> after just seven weeks, following opposition from a small number of local people.</p> \n<p>We ride along the latter road, dodging cars parked in what was once the cycle lane. Vine points to burn marks still visible from where it was removed. “Every day I see this, and it drives me nuts,” he says.</p> \n<p>Sitting in a cafe on a sidestreet, Vine explains how he “became more and more immersed in this issue of why can’t I travel to work safely”, something for which he is routinely targeted for abuse on social media, as well as sniping articles in some newspapers.</p> \n<p>He is worried about the way that making our cities safer to travel in for pedestrians and cyclists has somehow become a polarising issue. “We have let so much of our cities go over to cars that we’re having to pull it back, and that requires incredibly difficult politics.”</p> \n<p>Although, he says: “This is not a political thing – if you can create safe cycling space, you have the potential to free up thousands of miles of the transport network, and cleaning up the city, making it safer.”</p> \n<p>But what is frustrating to him is that as you do that, “you run into the sort of opposition that doesn’t make any sense at all, the most bizarre pressure groups.”</p> \n<p>While he has an equivocal relationship with Twitter, Vine can give as good as he gets, not least his mischievous habit of fanning the myth that the curiously top-down footage shot by his camera actually comes from a drone flying above him.</p> \n<p>He thinks carefully about featuring the faces of miscreant drivers, reserving this for the most obviously aggressive or law-breaking, and does not, for example, publicly endorse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/will-local-elections-put-the-brakes-on-low-traffic-neighbourhood-schemes\">low-traffic neighbourhood schemes</a> he has never seen.</p> \n<p>But even as a BBC employee, Vine says his obvious views on the need for more bike infrastructure are not a problem for the corporation. “I think the general principle is, I can speak truthfully and from my own point of view about issues like cycling down this street, which I do every day, or road deaths. We’re not impartial about road death – it’s a bad thing, and cycle safety is a good thing, and it’s clear that the more segregated cycle lanes you have, the safer cyclists are.”</p> \n<p>As shown by the brief experiment with the black Mercedes, Vine is as much fascinated by the psychology of driving as he is by the politics of road infrastructure, forever trying to puzzle out what might put him in danger.</p> \n<p>“For too long we’ve had the view that if you’re driving a car, and you’re going at 29mph on a 30mph street, it doesn’t matter what happens in front of you, you’re not to blame,” he says. “You become much more conscious of other road users when you are vulnerable yourself.</p> \n<p>“But something odd has happened with car safety. Cars are sold on the basis you’ll be moving around in a massive shell, with airbags. No one who buys a car ever says: ‘What will happen if this hits a child?’ Clearly the mindset has changed. The cars have become obese, followed by the drivers.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/19/the-guide-house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T10:50:08Z","webTitle":"The Guide #48: Should you watch House of the Dragon?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/19/the-guide-house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/19/the-guide-house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones","fields":{"headline":"The Guide #48: Should you watch House of the Dragon?","trailText":"In this week’s newsletter: Struggling to commit to more dragons, blond wigs and court intrigue after Game of Thrones’s disappointing end? Let us help you decide","byline":"Gwilym Mumford","body":"<p>Remember how you felt when Game of Thrones ended? Remember that rush of disappointment when you realised that the show you had been obsessively watching for the best part of a decade had thoroughly botched the landing? Remember the baffling character development, rushed plotlines and that altogether too tidy conclusion? Remember when they forgot to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/20/game-of-thrones-plastic-water-bottle-finale\">remove that plastic water bottle</a> from a shot? Bit of a disaster, wasn’t it.</p> <p>Now, three years later, HBO are hoping that you’re willing to forget all that unpleasantness, and tune in to their much-ballyhooed GoT prequel series House of the Dragon, which airs on Sunday evening in the US and on Monday in the UK and Australia. Set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, it tells the story of a brutal civil war between various members of the Targaryen family as they position themselves to become the rightful heirs of King Viserys (a magnificently bewigged Paddy Considine, above right). There will, naturally, be dragons and platinum blond hair swishing all over the place. For a bit more plot detail than my whistlestop summary, check out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/house-of-the-dragon-review-game-of-thrones-prequel-got\">Lucy Mangan’s four-star first-look review</a>.</p> <p>But are you really ready to return to Westeros? I’ve already watched the first handful of episodes of House of the Dragon (don’t worry, I’ll be light on spoilers) and have come up with five questions you should ask yourself before you make that decision. Think of it as a Cosmo quiz, but with (even more) beheadings. Away we go …</p> <p><strong>1. Just how annoyed were you with how Game of Thrones ended?</strong></p> <p>If you were incandescent with fury at how GoT went out, you might not be quite ready for House of the Dragon. After all, the two shows are essentially playing in the same sandbox: same house names (Targaryen, Lannister et al); some of the same settings (King’s Landing, looking resplendent and rather less singed than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/13/game-of-thrones-recap-season-eight-episode-five-the-bells\">last time we saw it</a>); the same fantastical CGI beasties flying about overhead; even the same theme tune, albeit one that’s far shorter than the two-minute-odd opus of its predecessor. So yes, if just thinking about those opening blasts of “daaa-daaa-da-da-daa-daa” is already raising your blood pressure, you might want to give this one a swerve.</p> <p>However, if you were disappointed by GoT’s ending but still hold residual affection for the show’s earlier years, I have good news: HotD is <em>that</em> show – intricately plotted, densely dialogued, displaying a pleasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/18/game-of-thrones-has-lost-its-evil-streak-and-its-a-crying-shame\">ruthless streak</a>. Perhaps my favourite thing about it though is how <em>small</em> it feels compared to those final episodes of GoT. Don’t get me wrong, it’s grand and gorgeously shot and just dripping with HBO budget (there’s a spectacular battle scene in its third episode). But gone are those endless po-faced existential CGI battles for humanity, and instead we’re back to the days of palace intrigue, familial feuding and brutal backstabbing. This is a series that, so far, has more limited ambitions than its predecessor, and is all the better for it.</p> <p><strong>2. How do you feel about prequels?</strong></p> <p>At their worst, prequels can feel rather redundant, providing unnecessary buildup to the more interesting story you’ve already watched. In the case of House of the Dragon, we already know of the demise of the Targaryen dynasty further down the ancestral line, so watching this particular mob of blond-haired sociopaths squabble among themselves might seem a little pointless. Equally though, this is a story that Thrones creator George RR Martin has long alluded to in his A Song of Ice and Fire books, and is regarded as quite a major event in the history of Westeros in its own right. So far I’m finding it compelling enough as a standalone tale.</p> <p><strong>3. How do you feel about Matt Smith?</strong></p> <p>Ever since Doctor Who, I’ve always found that a little of Matt Smith (above left) goes a long way. An unapologetically <em>big</em> actor, he tends to dominate scenes, sometimes to the detriment of the wider spectacle. He’s terrific here, I think, as Viserys’s brooding, vicious brother and heir apparent Daemon, a role that allows him to scenery-chew with abandon. But the ham-averse might want to steer clear.</p> <p><strong>4. How strong is your stomach?</strong></p> <p>At its peak, GoT was almost gleefully bloody (that sound you can hear is me audibly gagging at the thought of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jun/02/game-of-thrones-recap-season-four-episode-eight-the-mountain-and-the-viper\">Oberyn Martell’s gruesome demise</a> in season four) but as the show raced towards its conclusion it seemed to tone down the overflowing gore somewhat. Early signs from House of the Dragon though are that entrails are very much back on the menu, as are head-smashings, limb removal and – here’s a new one – the sight of soldiers being devoured by crabs. There’s also a scene in the show’s first episode which, while not nearly as operatically violent as those described above, is horribly real and far more upsetting to watch. The squeamish should tread carefully.</p> <p><strong>5. How much fantasy can you take?</strong></p> <p>In two weeks’ time, hot on House of the Dragon’s heels, comes Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/18/the-guide-lord-of-the-rings-amazon\">Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</a>, an even grander spectacle of sorcery and swordplay. But just how much fantasy is too much fantasy? Can anyone juggle two epic shows at the same time without totally losing their grip on reality, and referring to Tesco cashiers as “sire” and “fair maiden”? You might want to make a call on which one you’re going with in advance. Choose wisely, fair traveller (see, I’m doing it already).</p> <p><em>If you want to read the complete version of this newsletter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/sep/14/guide-signup\">please subscribe</a> to receive The Guide in your inbox every Friday.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"community-of-solvers/2022/aug/19/i-used-crisis-as-a-catalyst-for-growth-why-resilience-matters-in-an-unpredictable-world","type":"article","sectionId":"community-of-solvers","sectionName":"Community of solvers","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T10:47:18Z","webTitle":"‘I used crisis as a catalyst for growth’: why resilience matters in an unpredictable world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community-of-solvers/2022/aug/19/i-used-crisis-as-a-catalyst-for-growth-why-resilience-matters-in-an-unpredictable-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community-of-solvers/2022/aug/19/i-used-crisis-as-a-catalyst-for-growth-why-resilience-matters-in-an-unpredictable-world","fields":{"headline":"‘I used crisis as a catalyst for growth’: why resilience matters in an unpredictable world","trailText":"After being carjacked as a teenager, Claudia van den Heuvel developed a fascination with people’s behaviour. Now a crisis management specialist at PwC, she draws on her personal experiences to advise clients on how to learn from adversity","byline":"Christian Koch","body":"<p>When Claudia van den Heuvel was 13, the Jeep she was travelling in was carjacked by two armed men. Living in Caracas at the time, she was returning from a sleepover when the incident happened.</p> <p>After a terrifying ride around the Venezuelan capital, the carjackers deposited van den Heuvel and her chaperone at a country club. But the experience remained with her for years.</p> <p>There was a positive outcome of this terrifying episode – it shaped her career. Van den Heuvel, a director in the crisis and resilience practice at the professional services firm PwC, says: “I think I became a psychologist and a risk professional because the event triggered a fascination with others’ behaviour. I used the crisis as a catalyst for growth; a chance to learn something about myself and how it can benefit others.”</p> <p>The ability to learn from – and ultimately reframe – adversity is something van den Heuvel instils in her clients at PwC’s global Crisis Leadership Centre, which supports organisations, and equips their future leaders in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from crises. During the pandemic, business leaders had their resilience tested like never before. Indeed, 70% of those responding to <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/crisis-solutions/global-crisis-survey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">PwC’s 2021 Global Crisis Survey</a> said their business was negatively impacted.</p> <p>A litany of unpredictable global events have followed, including the war in Ukraine, the cost-of-living crisis and soaring energy prices – putting further and sustained strain on businesses and their leaders. While there’s a temptation to wait for a crisis to pass before setting long-term strategic goals, businesses should do the opposite, says van den Heuvel. “It’s setting goals amid mess and uncertainty [that breeds resilience]. Being creative and agile helps you think of different solutions to the problems.”</p> <p>On a personal level, stress is a normal response to a crisis, says van den Heuvel. “You are hard-wired to have a fight or flight reaction. Even high-performing experts and leaders in a field are not immune to the physiological impacts created by stress and uncertainty. I train executive teams in the basics: psychological tricks you can employ to destress.”</p> <p>She adds: “We need to develop the mindset and soft skills that create resilience.”</p> <p>But how do you develop such traits? The first place to look is close to home. Our personal and professional lives are inextricably intertwined when it comes to resilience. For leaders, prioritising their own health and wellbeing so they’re physically and mentally fit to lead is equally as important as safeguarding employees’ wellbeing. “Yes, compassion and empathy for others are important traits in a crisis for a leader, but you have to start with yourself,” says van den Heuvel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a9c836f0b4050cbcd43a9f84d73f46f6daa091\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a9c836f0b4050cbcd43a9f84d73f46f6daa091/0_24_509_305/500.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of relaxed young man with bluetooth headphones in forest\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Resilience is founded in recharge and moments of pause,’ says van den Heuvel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: damircudic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2019 van den Heuvel found herself having to focus on her own personal resilience, after going through some traumatic experiences: her partner left shortly after she gave birth, she and her child contracted a nasty virus, and then there was the loneliness of being a single mum during the Covid pandemic. Yoga helped, she says, as did writing an ingratitude journal – what you are not grateful for. “This moves you out of a state of inaction, and leads you to implement changes in your life that align with what you value most.”</p> <p>When faced with a crisis, our initial instinct might be to react, but it’s important to take a step back and reflect before responding, she says. “Especially with a long-term crisis like Covid, it’s knowing at the beginning of a crisis to set an A team and a B team and send the B-team home, and say: ‘We know you want to be here, we know that everyone is really motivated to help the organisation through this, but in 12 hours’ time, these people are going to be tired and stressed and I’m going to need you to come in as a fresh pair of hands.’”</p> <p>Moments of pause are crucial, and can prevent burnout: “You don’t really learn from a crisis unless you take the time to reflect on what you’ve actually done, because otherwise you’ll keep going and run out [of steam]. We have a warped understanding of resilience: we think we’re like Navy Seals and can keep going forever. We can’t. Resilience is founded in recharge and moments of pause.”</p> <p>When disaster strikes, harness the intel at your disposal, whether customer data or ideas from your wider network, to foster decision making. “Resilient leaders flatten hierarchies and extend information sources widely,” says van den Heuvel.</p> <p>Reflecting on previous hardships can also help develop a “muscle memory” for resilience. There’s a reason “fail fast, fail often” is a Silicon Valley mantra: learning from tough times identifies blind spots to prevent the disaster happening again.<br><br>Van den Heuvel’s experiences are testament to the notion that crisis can fuel transformation. She says: “Don’t view a crisis as something you need to hide from. Reframing it as an opportunity is the best way to deal with it.”</p> <p><em>Find out how PwC helps clients <a href=\"http://pwctrk.co.uk/tp/rj6_dcQsa-J.K\" rel=\"nofollow\">build resilience and navigate risk</a> – and the career opportunities available in this area of the business</em></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"global-development/2022/aug/19/hunger-in-tigray-pushing-women-and-girls-into-sex-work","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T10:44:03Z","webTitle":"Hunger in Tigray pushing women and girls into sex work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/19/hunger-in-tigray-pushing-women-and-girls-into-sex-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/aug/19/hunger-in-tigray-pushing-women-and-girls-into-sex-work","fields":{"headline":"Hunger in Tigray pushing women and girls into sex work","trailText":"People turn to desperate measures after authorities stop 6 million people accessing their own money","byline":"Lucy Kassa","body":"<p>Hunger in the besieged region of Tigray is pushing people to increasingly desperate measures as the authorities are systematically blocking and confiscating remittances needed by millions of people.</p> <p>Banking services and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/29/anguish-of-tigrayan-families-cut-off-by-telecom-shutdown-ethiopia\">all communications have been cut off</a> to the state by the Ethiopian administration since last year, with 6 million people denied access to their own money.</p> <p>In the absence of aid and banking, people had been largely relying on money from family and friends abroad to survive but restrictions have been imposed on remittances by the Tigrayan authorities, and action against smugglers bringing money in has intensified at checkpoints.</p> <p>Reports from inside Tigray say many women and girls are being forced to turn to sex work to survive while others suggest there has been an increase in suicide.</p> <p>Last week, EU and US envoys urged the Ethiopian government to swiftly resume services and lift restrictions on fuel essential for aid distribution.</p> <p>When the Tigray rebel forces returned to power a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/05/ethiopia-tigray-war-who-is-fighting-and-what-has-been-the-toll\">after nearly eight months of fighting with Ethiopian federal forces</a>, Hewan* thought life might improve.

So, I went to the street to sell my body. What option do I have?”</p> <p>Like Hewan many women and girls in Tigray’s capital, Mekelle, are engaging in survival sex, including underage girls and women who once had promising careers.</p> <p>Zufan* has a master’s degree in project management and before the war the 27-year-old had a well-established career with a good salary and a plan to pursue a PhD. These days she is selling her body to survive the hunger which claimed the life of her parent.</p> <p>“I watched my father die from malnourishment. He died in my hands. My mother is all bones. The warehouses are full of aid enough to feed the city. Fuel is not required to distribute aid within Mekelle. But people are dying unable to receive the aid they are entitled to. After I lost my father to starvation, I needed to do something to save my own life and my mother’s. Hunger does not give you time. I tried begging. But it does not work as there are many beggars. I became a prostitute,” Zufan does have money in her bank account, but banks in Tigray have stopped giving out money, cut off from the central federal system and empty of cash.</p> <p>For many desperate Tigryan women who had exhausted all alternatives, sex work ffers the only lifeline.</p> <p>Last month, the news about a civil servant who killed himself in Mekelle after finding it unbearable to watch his three children starve and his wife beg for food, was widely circulating in the city. </p> <p>Araya*, 60, is a landlord and lived on rental income from the houses he owns, but he has not been able to collect rent from his out of work tenants who have no money to pay him.</p> <p>What sustained his life was the remittance his children sent him through the smugglers.</p> <p>Based on negotiations with the sender, the smugglers take 30% to 50% of the remittance and arrange the delivery of the remaining amount to the recipient.</p> <p>“Without remittance, I would have gone begging or died from hunger.

It is not allowed by the federal government. Transportation is blocked into the region. We do it through connections and by bribing officers. That’s why we take up to 50% of the remittance. Otherwise, it is impossible. And after passing through many obstacles to reach Tigray, if we don’t have any guarantee from the Tigray authorities to deliver the cash to the starved, why should we take risks?” said Tsegay*, a former smuggler who quit the work in May after being stopped at the border by Tigrayan officers.</p> <p>Smugglers described harassment, criminalisation, unpredictable restrictions on the amount of money one can carry into Tigray, and confiscation of money intended for hungry people.</p> <p>“This is business to us, but lifesaving to the people dying from starvation. I don’t know why the authorities are creating such restrictions on us while millions are starving to death. Previously, the flow was smooth once it reached the Tigray border. But after April it has become a nightmare. My colleagues and I left the business because of that,” said Abadi*, another former smuggler. “We want free access at least in Tigray. Otherwise, it is not worth it. It is money to people suffering in famine after all. There should not be any hindrance. This is cruel.”</p> <p>Others accused Tigray authorities of confiscating the money for themselves at the checkpoints.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jun/20/its-death-either-way-desperate-tigrayans-flee-starvation-and-forced-conscription\">‘It’s death either way’: desperate Tigrayans flee starvation and forced conscription</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There was 73,000 birr (£1,147) I tried to deliver. The money was sent to family members in a terrible condition with nothing to eat. Tigray authorities took the money. I was not given any valid reason by their officers. Of course, publicly they give many excuses. But the reality is they set up the posts to grab money at the expense of dying family members. I stopped the work after that incident. There was no guarantee to continue,” said Berket*, another former smuggler.</p> <p>An internal decree seen by the Guardian corroborates the testimonies. The decree states it is illegal to carry more than 100,000 birr, and cash which flows to the region should be reported to posts in the border. If someone is found operating outside this, the person will be charged with committing a crime, and the Tigray government can directly confiscate the money, based on the decision of a committee established for the task.</p> <p>The committee is chaired by Fetlework Gebregziabher, vice president of the Tigray government. The decree is signed and stamped by Fetelework and has been in operation since April.</p> <p>A spokesperson of the Tigray government denied money was being confiscated and told the Guardian there is not enough cash coming in to justify any such restrictions.</p> <p>“We rather encourage any possible cash inflow.

In the last five years, catwalks – and the high street – have urged us to dress for the great outdoors (hiking wear or gorpcore as it became known), the great indoors (think tech bros in expensive grey hoodies), or simply with doors – in 2017, New York Magazine claimed we all want to look like architects, and the British high street followed suit.</p> <p>But with the UK in the midst of an NHS<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/dental-deserts-form-in-england-as-dentists-quit-nhs-experts-warn\"> “dental desert”</a>, is this trend simply a case of scarcity value, of dressing not for the job you want, but for the treatment?</p> <p>“I’m not surprised at all and I’d bet that social media has helped propagate this,” says Anjli Patel, a Derbyshire-based orthodontist and spokesperson for the British Orthodontist Society, pointing towards dental colleagues who post about their “Jordans” on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"908584d5e1cedbc203edcaeb103574c92934b021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/908584d5e1cedbc203edcaeb103574c92934b021/70_0_560_700/400.jpg\" alt=\"An Erevan lab coat by Pastelli.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Erevan lab coat by Pastelli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pastelli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“But it’s really about the [casualisation] of the industry. What I wear to work has changed enormously. Like every workplace, uniforms are out and comfort is in. The stuff we’re wearing is conducive to work but that much more wearable.” Patel sees a lot of Crocs “and I was sure they were for the garden”.</p> <p>Patel mentions trousers with cuffed hems and “trackie b scrubs” that look like the sort of loungewear you might find at Arket but are from uniform suppliers such as <a href=\"https://scrubsuk.com/collections/cherokee\">Cherokee</a>. For sunglasses, Euronda is the professional’s choice, though they bear a striking resemblance to the glasses worn by the musician Steve Lacy. </p> <p>There are guidelines, though. “The main concern is cross-infection so whatever dentists wear to practice, they don’t wear in public,” says Anshu Sood, a specialist orthodontist. “Clothes need to be launderable, with slightly shortened sleeves so you don’t drag your sleeve across the patient, but otherwise it’s quite relaxed.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9241e9cd83429ff12495e3b07ca3f382b85f916e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9241e9cd83429ff12495e3b07ca3f382b85f916e/0_504_8053_4834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Lacy wears perspex glasses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Lacy wears perspex glasses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like most quirky trends, the key is in the styling. Worn head to toe, you risk looking Halloween-adjacent. Cherrypick certain elements – a lab coat or some white clogs – and no one would know you are actually wearing clinical-wear. The white lab coat in particular “means you could wear your own clothes underneath it and then simply pop it on and become someone else while still being yourself underneath,” adds Sood. “You know, like Superman.</p> <p>“Before the pandemic, and certainly before the so-called [current dental] crisis, people took dentistry for granted, avoided it or put it off,” says Sood. “The NHS used to tell us that a uniform inspired clinical confidence, particularly given the reputation,” she says, referring to the theory of enclothed cognition, or the use of clothing to affect opinion. “Based on that, we tried to look the part.</p> <p>“Now I think people are valuing our worth.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/19/jaubi-review-union-chapel-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T10:31:54Z","webTitle":"Jaubi review – Pakistani genre-hoppers wing it to glorious heights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/19/jaubi-review-union-chapel-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/19/jaubi-review-union-chapel-london","fields":{"headline":"Jaubi review – Pakistani genre-hoppers wing it to glorious heights","trailText":"The daring quartet fuse jazz, raga and Indian classical in a debut UK show that showcases their improvisational genius","byline":"Ammar Kalia","body":"<p>Pakistani quartet Jaubi are best described as improvisers rather than a band that operates within a particular genre.

They back a blistering, John Coltrane-inspired soprano saxophone solo from guest Tenderlonious on a buoyant version of the track Nafs at Peace, while Raga Gujri Todi builds from an ambient opening featuring Latarnik’s undulating synth pads into a fierce sarangi solo. Here, Khan effortlessly meanders between raga and jazz voicings, sometimes in a single melodic line, showcasing Jaubi’s natural fusion.</p> <p>Through eschewing the formalities of classical traditions, Jaubi make their UK debut a uniquely confident display – even if it is missing an acknowledgment of their early boom-bap days.

DeVito will be imparting details of his dad’s identity only in fragments, because that’s how he found out. And he’s right, it does frustrate a little, as our host dwells on his own scrappy schooldays – when, mysteriously, he was never allowed to watch The Godfather – then on his failed romantic relationships as he finds his feet as an adult.</p> <p>The idea is to show how rootless he was, guided by only a fantasy father figure, carefully pieced together from scraps Anthony gleaned about his real dad. The show also strives to parallel the son’s young adulthood with that of his beloved mum, who got hitched to a charming Italian-American only to discover she’d bitten off more cannoli than she could chew.</p> <p>This strategy is only partially successful: the parallels are not strong. We’re left with gnawing questions, too, about the present-day status of DeVito’s clan – and a not-wholly-satisfied curiosity about his father’s career as a “made man”, of which DeVito gives a slightly coy account.</p> <p>Fair enough: the comedian still has mixed filial feelings, even accounting for the “very heinous reality”, as he puts it, of his dad’s life. There’s an according honesty to this maiden Edinburgh hour. DeVito is an unpretentious and likable comic, and his tale of a family history unearthed is thoughtful and alarming by turns.

Then there was a emoji-laden update on a group set up for a snazzy upcoming birthday party and, for balance, an update – with photos – from a neighbour about the snail problem in her garden, as well as individual voice notes, which had arrived while I was sleeping, from my son and my cousin in Thailand and South Africa respectively.<br><br>“My email inbox is just work and spam and newsletters I can’t figure out how to unsubscribe from,” says my friend Simon. “My Instagram feed is gorgeous to look at, but it’s just entertainment, to be scrolled with a pinch of salt. WhatsApp is the bit on my phone where my real life happens.”<br><br>With 2 billion users, WhatsApp is the most popular messaging platform in the world, ahead of Facebook Messenger (988m) and WeChat (1.2bn). Launched by Yahoo alumni Brian Acton and Jan Koum in 2009, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/20/facebook-turned-down-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton-job-2009\" title=\"\">bought by Facebook</a> five years later, WhatsApp has infiltrated our lives at every level, from international politics – Boris Johnson was widely reported to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/saudis-asked-boris-johnson-to-intervene-in-newcastle-united-bid\" title=\"\">exchanged private messages</a> with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman – to the politics of the school gate.</p> <p>In Bond Street’s fashion flagships, sales assistants who once waited for big spenders to walk through the doors now WhatsApp photos of the hottest new deliveries to favoured customers as soon as they land in the store. Often the sale has gone through and the package dispatched by courier without the clothes ever hitting the shopfloor.</p> <p>But have we reached peak WhatsApp? Lockdown was the platform’s age of innocence, with neighbourhood group chats pinging with pithy one-liners and a never-ending stream of cat videos keeping morale high between isolated work-from-home colleagues.</p> <p>As the honeymoon period wears off, WhatsApp is starting to feel like yet another workstream, on top of all those unanswered emails and voicemails you never get around to listen to. The blue-tick system that shows whether a message has been read by the recipient, which seemed so useful at first, has become a social etiquette minefield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"967cf7e90ac75fe3828473335e11e64a20f0d536\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/967cf7e90ac75fe3828473335e11e64a20f0d536/0_0_3343_3369/992.jpg\" alt=\"Woman talking to an empty face\" width=\"992\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The modern WhatsApp user has more correspondence to deal with than a Bridgerton sister after the Queen’s ball.</p> <p> This year has also shown WhatsApp in a seedier light, under high court scrutiny over a lost password at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/first-week-highlights-of-coleen-rooney-v-rebekah-vardy-wagatha-christie\" title=\"\">Wagatha Christie trial</a> and with a cameo role in the downfall of a prime minister as messages revealed what Johnson did, in fact, know about Chris Pincher. Meanwhile, the recent introduction of a new <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-10984023/WhatsApp-launch-stealth-mode-hides-online-status.html\" title=\"\">“stealth” mode</a>, allowing users to hide their “online” or “last seen” status from specific contacts, suggests the beginning of WhatsApp fatigue. Another promised update will allow users to exit a a group silently, with only the administrators notified of their departure.</p> <p>Text messaging used to be a blunt back-and-forth exchange, a little like communicating by leaving notes on the fridge. By folding photos, videos – and other people – seamlessly into the exchange, WhatsApp chats have evolved to better mimic real-life conversation. Add a memoji for a facial expression, a gif for a laugh. The assumption that face-to-face communication is irreplaceable, already eroded by the smartphone era, has been further challenged by the enforced isolation of lockdowns and the long tail of work-from-home that has followed. There is no conversation so important or so delicate it can’t be conducted over text these days. Jill Biden recently revealed that she and her husband conduct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jun/03/fexting-like-bidens-relationships-arguing-by-text-psychologists\" title=\"\">arguments over text</a>, to avoid being overheard by the ever-present security detail.<br><br>But it is the group chat functionality that has embedded itself in our everyday lives. The beauty of a group chat is not just its ability to keep a connection alive regardless of geography and time zone, but in “democratising the friendship group,” says journalist Scarlett Conlon, who has upward of a dozen groups active at any one time, and others archived but ready to jump back into life. (“Who Will Win Strictly”, for instance, is dormant for nine months of each year, but on fire during the autumn.)</p> <p>“I still chat to lots of people one-on-one as well,” says Conlon. “But group chats are more inclusive of people who historically might have got information secondhand, because staying in touch maybe isn’t their strong point, or it’s not their thing to text a lot. People who struggle to find an ‘in’ can send a one-line update or gif to a group and it keeps them in the loop.”<br><br>“I think what WhatsApp does for group friendships is brilliant,” agrees my sister Alice. (I don’t know how many group chats she is on, but she’s in five different groups that I am also in, as well as our one-on-one chat, so I’m guessing quite a few.) “It shifts the centre of gravity away from multiple individual friendships, which inevitably ebb and flow, and puts it in the middle of the group where it is accessible to everyone. The group becomes more bonded and more balanced, because no one is taking on all the emotional labour of arrangements, and no one is getting left out.”</p> <p>Not everyone likes the background hum of cat videos, petition links and who had what for lunch. “My technophobe father abruptly left the family group one day – not realising the group would be notified – exclaiming to my mother that he ‘didn’t want to read about everyone’s sausages’,” says Joseph Kocharian, fashion director of Attitude magazine. “My brother stays out of the chat too, and lets the matriarchs of the family and myself, the gay son, run riot.”</p> <p>Star turns on the chat include Kocharian’s aunt, whose commentary on a pilgrimage to Lindisfarne “read like an Alan Bennett story”, and his late grandmother, who posted red and black hearts in keeping with “her Cruella de Vil aesthetic of monochrome animal print and Chanel. She was strengthening her brand image on WhatsApp.”<br><br>Neighbourhood WhatsApp groups that sprang up during lockdown have evolved to reflect shifts in mood and priorities. Where I live, there are weeks when they are set by the national news agenda (a community hive-mind getting together to navigate the visa system for Ukrainian refugees), moments when local issues dominate (anyone know if the pizza place is closing for good?), and slow news days when a lost tortoise gets top billing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/19/if-felt-beautiful-when-neighbours-came-together-on-whatsapp-during-covid-then-came-the-rows-about-teens\">It felt beautiful when neighbours came together on WhatsApp during Covid.

My friend Violet is on one of these, with “men and women I’ve never met updating me on childcare arrangements. That is <em>your</em> stuff – everyone has enough of their own stuff: 30 people don’t need to know your logistics.”</p> <p>But WhatsApp is not just for friends and family. In Westminster, it rules. “I couldn’t do my job without WhatsApp,” says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessica-elgot\" title=\"\">Jessica Elgot</a>, the Guardian’s chief political correspondent. “There is no way you could operate as a political journalist without it. No 10 uses the platform to send out statements, party communications go through broadcast groups, and there is a huge press gallery group.”</p> <p>Alliances between the modern intake of Tory MPs are now defined by who they’re in a WhatsApp group with, rather than which club they belong to. In WhatsApp, Westminster has found a platform that turbocharges its favourite sport: gossip. This is dangerous: MPs can be caught off-guard by the <em>sotto</em><em> voce</em> feel of a message tapped on to a tiny green box, mistaking it for genuine privacy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Screengrabs showed Nadine Dorries being removed from a 100-strong group of Tory MPs over her fangirling of Boris Johnson</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“What’s surprising is how indiscreet even experienced politicians can be,” says Elgot. “It gives you a sense of being among friends, but a big WhatsApp group isn’t like that.” Last year, screengrabs emerged showing Nadine Dorries being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/19/how-lord-frosts-exit-led-to-a-twitter-frenzy\" title=\"\">removed</a> from a 100-strong group of Tory MPs over her fangirling of Boris Johnson. Steve Baker, former chair of the European Research Group, removed her with the comment “Enough is enough”. WhatsApp is trialling an “edit” button, which will allow for more subtle redactions than the “this message has been deleted” function.</p> <p>The future of WhatsApp is still uncertain. (Anyone remember how crazy we were for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/10/houseparty-is-over-video-app-that-boomed-in-lockdown-meets-its-end\" title=\"\">Houseparty</a>, back in April 2020?) In the UK, it is used by 75% of the population aged from 16-64, but takeup in the US, where SMS is still dominant, is only 23%. All over the world, it is less popular with teenagers than with older age groups. (Younger people already use the private story settings to create their own friendship “group chats” on Instagram and other platforms, rather than using those platforms to broadcast to everyone who follows them.)</p> <p>And outside the worlds of politics and flagship fashion stores, WhatsApp has yet to be integrated into our ordinary work lives: my unscientific straw-polling concluded that while most of us appreciate the off-the-record vibe of an unofficial team group chat, with in-jokes and puppy photos, we draw the line at getting messaged by the boss. (“It feels like an invasion of what is supposed to be a safe space,” as my friend Isabel puts it.)<br><br>While it would not be accurate to say that WhatsApp retains an air of innocence – it is implicated in too many Westminster plots for that to be true – it does have, still, a kind of youthful energy which other social platforms lack, having been either flatlined by marketing (Instagram) or bulldozed into party lines (Twitter). WhatsApp still feels like a connection, not a workstream.</p> <p>This has not escaped the notice of major brands. Most of us have got wise to the reality that “storytelling” is just a pretty word for being told why we should buy something. Next, surely, we need to steel ourselves against brands’ leveraging of the conversational back-and-forth format of WhatsApp into a business opportunity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/11/ico-urges-ministers-to-review-use-of-whatsapp-and-other-private-channels\">ICO urges ministers to review use of Whatsapp and other private channels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Facebook – now Meta, the owner of WhatsApp since 2014 – has, so far, honoured the wishes of the platform’s founders to keep it free of advertisements.

In which case, monetisation of this data may be on the horizon.</p> <p>But for now, WhatsApp is where we go for a chat. “When I’m walking home from work, I could look at the news on my phone, or check my step count, or update my to-do list,” says Rosie. “But I would much rather message my friends and find out what everyone’s cooking for dinner.”</p> <h2><strong>How to </strong><strong>win at WhatsApp</strong></h2> <p>• Let other people speak, ask them about their lives, and don’t bang on about yourself endlessly.

He warned that additional funding for the Internal Revenue Service would lead to armed auditors banging down front doors to squeeze hard-earned dollars from working Americans.</p> <p>“Are they going to have a strike force that goes in with AK-15s already loaded, ready to shoot some small-business person in Iowa with these?” Senator Chuck Grassley said on Fox News last week.</p> <p>The image conjured up by Grassley bears little resemblance to reality. Democrats have indeed directed nearly $80bn to the IRS over the next 10 years as part of their climate and healthcare spending package, the Inflation Reduction Act, which Joe Biden signed into law on Tuesday.</p> <p>But Republican lawmakers have spread hyperbolic and often false information about how those funds will be used, stoking outrage among their supporters and alarming experts who say the claims could increase the risk of political violence.</p> <p>Grassley is far from alone in invoking the image of gun-toting auditors. Based on <a href=\"https://www.jobs.irs.gov/resources/job-descriptions/irs-criminal-investigation-special-agent\">a job posting</a> for the IRS’s criminal investigations unit, which makes up only a small fraction of the agency’s employee base, prominent Republicans and conservative media figures have falsely claimed that the Democrats’ bill will arm tens of thousands of new auditors.</p> <p>The Fox News host Brian Kilmeade <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abughazalehkat/status/1557888971086209024\">has warned</a> his viewers that “Joe Biden’s new army” of armed IRS agents could “hunt down and kill middle-class taxpayers that don’t pay enough”, while the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPChairwoman/status/1557786431082356736\">suggested</a> Democrats may soon “send the IRS ‘SWAT team’ after your kids’ lemonade stand”.</p> <p>Such dubious claims have even made their way onto the House floor. As the House debated the Inflation Reduction Act last Friday, far-right congresswoman Lauren Boebert equated expanding IRS resources to “committing armed robbery on Americans”.</p> <p>That comment prompted a rebuke from John Yarmuth, the Democratic chair of the House budget committee.</p> <p>“This is Republicans making this up to scare the American people,” Yarmuth said in response to Boebert’s remarks. “I would implore my Republican colleagues to cut out the scare tactics, quit making things up and debate the substance of this bill.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0bf1f1350c280022d611fef597853c52ba9153bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bf1f1350c280022d611fef597853c52ba9153bb/0_0_4773_3182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Do you make $75,000 or less?

The sweeping bill includes a number of provisions to bring down Americans’ healthcare costs and reduce planet-heating emissions, marking the country’s most significant effort yet to tackle the climate crisis.</p> <p>The cost of the legislation is covered through a series of tax changes – including a new minimum corporate tax and a tax on companies’ purchases of their own shares<strong> </strong>–<strong> </strong>as well as enhanced IRS enforcement. The Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57444\">has estimated</a> that the additional IRS funding will bring in approximately $200bn in revenue over the next 10 years, more than covering the cost of the agency’s larger budget.</p> <p>Republicans have claimed it will result in additional audits for hundreds of thousands of middle-class Americans.</p> <p>“Do you make $75,000 or less? Democrats’ new army of 87,000 IRS agents will be coming for you,” the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, said in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1557088624499429377\">a tweet</a> last week.</p> <p>The 87,000 number has been repeatedly cited by Republicans, but it is not necessarily a reflection of how IRS funds will be used. The number appears to be taken from a chart buried in a <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/The-American-Families-Plan-Tax-Compliance-Agenda.pdf\">2021 treasury department report</a> about the need to increase the IRS budget.</p> <p>But IRS leaders note that the agency has not yet outlined specific plans for how the funds will be used over the next decade, and any new employees who are hired will fill a variety of roles.</p> <p>While more than half of the new IRS funds are earmarked for enforcement purposes, the agency also intends to use the money to improve its customer service and informational technology, both of which have suffered in recent years as a result of repeated budget cuts.</p> <p>Between 2010 and 2018, budget decreases resulted in a 22% decline in the overall number of IRS employees, while the number of people working in enforcement roles fell by 30%.</p> <p>Those staffing cuts have made it more difficult for average Americans to reach an IRS employee who might be able to answer basic questions about their tax returns. Fewer than 15,000 IRS workers handled nearly 200m calls received during the first half of 2021.</p> <p>And among the revenue agents and revenue officers who handle the most complicated audits, the losses have been even more severe, with roughly 40% of those employees leaving the agency. </p> <p>This appears to have benefitted America’s richest residents and largest corporations. With fewer experienced IRS staffers available to analyze complicated returns, audit rates for those groups have fallen dramatically.</p> <p>Between 2010 and 2018, the percentage of audits conducted on individual tax returns showing more than $10m in annual income fell from 18.4% to 6.7%, the treasury department <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/The-American-Families-Plan-Tax-Compliance-Agenda.pdf\">has said</a>. In that same time period, corporations with assets worth over $20bn saw their audit rate fall from 98% to 49.3%.</p> <p>“The impact of those budget cuts has been most helpful for high-income [people] and higher-wealth businesses and most harmful for ordinary filers that don’t have representation from lawyers or accountants,” said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University.</p> <p>Huang noted that the disproportionate decrease in audits of wealthier Americans can be partly attributed to the fact that audits of lower-income individuals are usually easier to conduct, meaning IRS employees need less training to complete them. As more experienced auditors have left the agency, audits overall have decreased, and lower-income Americans have become a larger proportion of the population receiving heightened IRS scrutiny.</p> <p>“The IRS doesn’t have the resources it needs to handle the complex returns of high-wealth filers and large businesses, and this is what the [Inflation Reduction Act] is intended to reverse,” Huang said.</p> <p>Indeed, Democrats have promised that the additional IRS funding will specifically be used to root out tax non-compliance among the wealthiest Americans and largest businesses. In a letter sent to the IRS commissioner last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, “Contrary to the misinformation from opponents of this legislation, small business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will not see an increase in the chances that they are audited.”</p> <p>But reassurances from the Biden administration and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/aug/11/kevin-mccarthy/kevin-mccarthys-mostly-false-claim-about-army-8700/\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/11/hyperbolic-gop-claims-about-irs-agents-audits/\">fact-checks</a> from reputable news organizations have not stopped Republicans from claiming that middle-class Americans should expect armed IRS agents to come knocking on their doors.</p> <p>“Those IRS agents are designed to come after you. They’re not designed to come after the billionaires and the big corporations,” Republican Senator Ted Cruz told Fox News earlier this month. “They’re designed to come after small businesses and working families across this country.”</p> <p>Jennifer Mercieca, a professor at Texas A&amp;M University and historian of American political rhetoric, said Republicans’ messaging around the IRS provisions serves to obscure their own taxation objectives.</p> <p>“Since they can’t come right out and say that they want low taxes for the wealthy and corporations – or, relatedly they don’t want to fund the IRS – they instead claim that average Americans’ rights are in danger,” Mercieca said. </p> <p>Some Republican lawmakers have gone so far as to directly tie the increased funding for the IRS to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/fbi-agents-trump-search-mar-a-lago-documents\">recent FBI search</a> of Donald Trump’s Florida resort.</p> <p>“After [today’s] raid on Mar A Lago what do you think the left plans to use those 87,000 new IRS agents for?” Republican Senator Marco Rubio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1556795448614060035\">said in a tweet</a> last week.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/us-political-violence-threats-against-lawmakers\">support for political violence on the rise</a> in the US, experts worry that Republican leaders’ fear-mongering over the IRS funding could increase the risk of attacks against government officials. Anger over the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago has already sparked an increase in the number of threats against the bureau’s agents and offices, and one man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/11/fbi-armed-man-gunfire-standoff-ohio\">was fatally shot</a> last week after trying to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati office.</p> <p>“What leaders say matters, and people listen to the political elites,” said Lilliana Mason, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on extreme partisanship.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Mason added: “Considering how many threats we’re seeing against FBI offices, it’s pretty clear that adding a new target to people who are already feeling angry and attacked and victimized is not a great idea.”</p> <p>Democratic members of Congress have also tried to ring the alarm about the potential ramifications of Republicans’ criticism of the IRS budget.</p> <p>“The incendiary conspiracy theories Republicans are pushing about armed IRS agents are increasingly dangerous and out of control,” the Senate finance committee chair, Ron Wyden, said last week. “It’s unbelievable that we even need to say this, but there are not going to be 87,000 armed IRS agents going door-to-door with assault weapons.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/19/us-covid-cases-mandates-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"‘Most have thrown their hands up’: has the US forgotten about Covid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/19/us-covid-cases-mandates-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/19/us-covid-cases-mandates-deaths","fields":{"headline":"‘Most have thrown their hands up’: has the US forgotten about Covid?","trailText":"As Americans go about their daily lives, severely affected Covid patients are wondering if others are moving too quickly from the worst days of the pandemic","byline":"Maya Yang in New York","body":"<p>Despite signs that indicate the latest Covid-19 surge is slowing down, an average of 400 deaths in the US is still reported on a daily basis.</p> <p>Various mask and social distancing mandates across the country are becoming anything but strictly enforced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/cdc-living-with-covid-should-be-countered-by-containing-virus\">‘Living with Covid’ should be countered by containing the virus once and for all | Eric Topol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as Americans and many of their elected officials go about their daily lives, many healthcare professionals still on the frontlines of the pandemic and severely affected Covid-19 patients are left wondering whether the rest of us are moving too quickly from the worst days of the pandemic.</p> <p>Have we simply forgotten about Covid-19?</p> <p>Data <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases_select_00\">obtained</a> earlier this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that the rate of new infections has been decreasing, with the country reporting an average of 107,000 new cases a day. This marks a 12% decrease compared to infection rates two weeks ago.</p> <p>Even though hospital admission rates have been increasing across the US this summer as a result of highly infectious variants, the amount of patients currently hospitalized with Covid-19 has plateaued at 43,000 patients, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/hundreds-americans-dying-covid-day-signs-latest-surge/story?id=88203012\">according to</a> the Department of Health and Human Services.</p> <p>By contrast, more than 160,000 virus-positive patients were hospitalized during last winter’s surge. Nevertheless, the daily average of 400 deaths across the country since spring remain a concerning figure for healthcare officials.</p> <p>Arghavan Salles, a clinical associate professor at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, expressed her frustrations over how officials and the public appears to be moving on from Covid-19, which continues to put healthcare workers under huge strain. “It feels somewhat like a personal affront, like all our sacrifices mean absolutely nothing because in the end, no one cares,” said Salles, who worked at ICUs during the height of the pandemic.</p> <p>The majority of the recent infections come from BA.4 and BA.5, subvariants of Omicron whose original strain first emerged over eight months ago. According to the CDC, the two variants appear to <a href=\"https://cv.nmhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/COVID-19-VOC-Case-Report_07_11_22.pdf\">represent</a> over 80% of the US cases.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It feels somewhat like a personal affront, like all our sacrifices mean absolutely nothing</p> <footer> <cite>Arghavan Salles</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With the virus continuing to mutate, breakthrough and rebound infections are becoming increasingly common, especially with the BA.5 variant. New data published in June by Harvard Medical School researchers reveal that the BA.4 and BA.5 appear to evade antibody responses from people who have been fully vaccinated and boosted and those who have previously gotten Covid-19.</p> <p>“We observed threefold reductions of neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccination and infection against BA.4 and BA.5 compared with BA1 and BA2, which are already substantially lower than the original Covid-19 variants,” the researchers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/health/ba4-ba5-escape-antibodies-covid-vaccine/index.html\">said</a> in a statement. BA.4 and BA.5 have been the fastest-spreading variants since the pandemic began.</p> <p>More recently, reports have been emerging of another Omicron subvariant, BA.4.6, which is Omicron’s seventh major subvariant since the variant first appeared in Africa last November. According to health experts, BA.4.6 possesses a certain mutation that gives it an increased ability to avoid antibodies.</p> <p>Currently, BA.4.6 has a 10% growth <a href=\"https://cov-spectrum.org/explore/United%20States/Surveillance/Past3M/variants?pangoLineage=BA.5&amp;pangoLineage1=BA.4.6&amp;analysisMode=CompareToBaseline&amp;\">advantage</a> of BA.5 and experts predict that the advantage will only grow larger.</p> <h2>Rolling back controls</h2> <p>As the pandemic stretches on and vaccines roll out, numerous <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2020/coronavirus-state-restrictions.html\">restrictions</a> are being eased. States have been lifting strict capacity limits and large-scale mask orders while many others are no longer requiring proof of vaccination to travel or to enter dining facilities.</p> <p>Last week, the CDC issued new guidelines that loosened its recommendations on social distancing and quarantining. Individuals who were exposed to Covid-19 no longer have to quarantine unless they develop symptoms or test positive.</p> <p>Unvaccinated people who have been exposed should test on the fifth day of exposure and wear a “high-quality mask”. Additionally, the CDC no longer recommends screening asymptomatic individuals who have not had a known exposure to the virus.</p> <p>“This guidance acknowledges that the pandemic is not over, but also helps us move to a point where Covid-19 no longer severely disrupts our daily lives,” CDC epidemiologist Greta Massetti said in a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/dallas/2022/08/15/cdc-updates-covid-quarantine-guidelines\">statement</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b65ff4be0b6b6101a8e7e33bad93f656bc645de7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b65ff4be0b6b6101a8e7e33bad93f656bc645de7/0_0_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People place self-administered PCR tests in a plastic container in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People place self-administered PCR tests in a plastic container in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Étienne Laurent/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Salles disagrees.</p> <p>“The new guidance suggesting people who have been exposed don’t need to quarantine but should instead wear a mask is likely to accelerate the spread of disease, especially because they don’t even say what kind of mask. What is, in their view, a ‘high-quality mask’? And, given the lack of mask mandates and the overall low rates of people wearing masks, it seems unlikely people will comply with this anyway,” she said.</p> <p>“Their guidance suggesting those who have tested positive only need to isolate for five days but should avoid being around those who are ‘likely to get very sick from Covid-19’ … [indicates] they only care about isolation if the person who is likely to be infected is at high risk,” she said.</p> <p>Not many people are aware of other people’s health problems, medications or their immune systems. As a result, Salles said “this guidance will put more people, and especially those with disabilities and immunocompromised status, at greater risk for getting sick”.</p> <h2>Not enough people getting boosted</h2> <p>Currently, only 67% of the US population are considered fully vaccinated. Moreover, only 32% of the population have received a booster dose. Healthcare officials have repeatedly stressed the effectiveness of vaccines in mitigating Covid-19. However, vaccine hesitancy as a result of misinformation, wariness and other factors continue to hold many back.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned individuals that if they are not up-to-date with their vaccines or booster shots, they will experience a difficult fall and winter.</p> <p>“If they don’t get vaccinated or they don’t get boosted, they’re going to get into trouble,” Fauci <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/knxam-on-demand/dr-anthony-fauci-on-masks-upcoming-covid-19-vaccin\">said,</a> adding that the country’s vaccine and booster rates are “quite discouraging”. According to Fauci, booster shots that target newer variants such as BA.5 will probably be available next month. “If you aren’t worried about your personal risk, do it for your communal responsibility,” he said.</p> <p>In May, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Dr Ashish Jha, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/05/06/fall-winter-coronavirus-wave/\">predicted </a>that the US may experience a major surge in winter with 100m new infections and a significant number of deaths and hospitalizations.</p> <p>“We are indeed very much still in the middle of the pandemic with intense transmission globally with close to a million cases daily and sadly over 14,000 people dying every week,” World Health Organization spokesperson Margaret Harris said. “With such high levels of transmission it is not surprising that the Sars-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve.”</p> <h2>Healthcare workers under pressure</h2> <p>With the pandemic slowly moving out of the public’s consciousness, healthcare workers continue to face a daily battle, fighting not only the virus but also significant staffing shortages in the field and a slew of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/19/us-faces-nurse-shortage-burnout-covid\">mental health issues</a>.</p> <p>Many hospitals across the US are facing a severe nursing shortage.

Brooks county, where authorities recovered 119 bodies last year, has had more deaths than any other Texas county over the last three decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"619dcd0a972f170ef0d2ef76b06e23510e890d40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/619dcd0a972f170ef0d2ef76b06e23510e890d40/0_0_4000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Rio Grande river, running along the US-Mexico border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rio Grande river, running along the US-Mexico border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Yeung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We’re struggling to deal with all the bodies,” said Don White, county deputy sheriff. Last year the county was provided with a mobile morgue by the state in response to the grisly human reaping. “I recently had to pick up three fresh ones in a day,” he said.</p> <p>Outside experts believe that federal immigration policies have exacerbated the tragedy, forcing migrants into ever-more perilous crossings, and leading refugee journeys – fleeing violence, persecution and climate disaster – to an anguished dead end.</p> <p>Eva Moya, an associate professor at the University of Texas studying the precarity faced by migrants, says the <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/migrant-protection-protocols\">Migrant Protection Protocols</a> (MPP), also known as “Remain in Mexico” – a policy introduced in 2019 under the Trump administration – have resulted in more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/09/biden-ends-remain-in-mexico-trump-policy\">70,000 people being sent</a> back into Mexico to wait for their US court cases, often for extended periods in makeshift camps, where they are often denied basic healthcare and face violence, rape, murder and kidnappings by organised crime groups.</p> <p>“The risk continues to increase,” says Moya. “Asylum seekers in Mexico are fearing for their lives and smugglers are taking advantage of that. They will do anything to make profit from these people. It’s human trafficking at its max.”</p> <p>The Biden administration is finally ending the policy, after court battles, but it’s unclear how and when things will change substantially on the ground.</p> <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/guide-title-42-expulsions-border\">Title 42</a>, ostensibly a pandemic-related health measure introduced in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/us-mexico-border-title-42-biden-trump-stranded-asylum\">closing border ports</a> of entry and allowing the border patrol to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/03/us-mexico-border-migrants-deported-no-explanation\">summarily expel</a> migrants without asylum hearings, has contributed to the deaths in Brooks county and beyond, said Alma Maquitico, director of the <a href=\"https://nnirr.org/\">National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights</a>.</p> <p>“Title 42 has led to a rise in deaths,” she said. “People aren’t crossing at cities any more, but in more faraway, dangerous areas.

The government wants to blame the cartel but not the policy that is creating this problem. The solution is to offer an ordered asylum pathway. You could fix this tomorrow,” he added.</p> <p>A spokesperson for <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/\">US Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP), which oversees the border patrol’s 20,000 agents working between the land ports of entry, said the death toll was the fault of traffickers.</p> <p>“Criminal organisations continue to recklessly endanger the lives of individuals they smuggle for their own financial gain with no regard for human life,” they said in a statement. “Despite these inherent dangers, smugglers continue to lie to migrants, claiming the borders are open. The borders are not open, and people should not attempt to make the dangerous journey.”</p> <p>Although Brooks county is about 70 miles from the US-Mexico border, it has the <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/border-patrol-sectors/rio-grande-valley-sector-texas/falfurrias-station\">largest border patrol checkpoint in Texas</a>. Located along US Highway 281, one of the few northbound highways along the hundreds of miles-long south Texas border region, the checkpoint processes an average 10,000 vehicles – traversing the busiest route from Mexico and Central America to the US – each day.</p> <p>Like other deterrence policies, the checkpoint, instead of reducing the number migrants trying to enter, has driven them into deadly routes, according to deputy sheriff Don White.</p> <p>People smugglers, often known as coyotes, demand thousands of dollars to help migrants cross the Rio Grande on rafts, usually to McAllen, Texas, where they will hide in dirty, cramped safe houses.</p> <p>Migrants will then be dropped off 50 miles north on sandy backroads, before being sent on a days-long trek across brutal terrain, where temperatures regularly exceed 100F during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/11/texas-heatwave-power-grid-ercot\">ever-hotter Texas summers</a> and drop below freezing in winter, in order to avoid the checkpoint.</p> <p>According to Oscar Carrillo, a sheriff in Culberson county, which is also dealing with a surge in bodies, smugglers often send groups of migrants in camouflage gear as well as with backpacks of cannabis, allowing them to reduce the fees owed by delivering the contraband to a contact, if they survive the journey.</p> <p>In February 2020, Carrillo apprehended a group of more than 50 people en route. “They are given an itinerary like a cruise line,” says Carrillo. “There’s been a huge rise in attempts to cross. But it’s a dangerous place – there are snakes, mountain lions. If they can’t continue, they’ll be left behind.”</p> <p>For those who make it over the first hurdles in an attempt to reach densely populated cities such as Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, where they can live under the radar of the authorities, the risk is far from over.</p> <p>In June, 53 immigrants, mostly from Mexico, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/28/texas-migrant-deaths-reaction-san-antonio\">were found dead inside a sweltering tractor-trailer</a> on the outskirts of San Antonio, Texas, in what was the nation’s deadliest smuggling incident along the US-Mexico border to date.</p> <p>Since 1999, more than 7,500 migrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and beyond are estimated to have died on the US-Mexico border, <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Mar/bp-southwest-border-sector-deaths-fy1998-fy2018.pdf\">according to data</a> from the CBP.</p> <p>Most of these deaths can be attributed to heatstroke or dehydration, according to Canales, who maintains 90 water stations out in the brush.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b241d2af04031f9d0471b30b3467c250d714d0e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b241d2af04031f9d0471b30b3467c250d714d0e1/0_0_382_958/199.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Alberto Callejas Corado, who disappeared during his trip from Guatemala to the US.\" width=\"199\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Alberto Callejas Corado, who disappeared during his trip from Guatemala to the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the real number of deaths is probably far higher, he said, due to limited data and a lack of support from federal authorities.</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://nri.tamu.edu/blog/2021/september/featured-map-land-ownership-types-across-the-us/\">95% of land</a> on the southern border of Texas – and 99% in Brooks county – is private, ranchers and farmers on the remote plots – some as large as 50,000 acres – are often the ones that discover the recently or long-deceased people. Brooks county sheriff’s office estimates it finds only one out of every five bodies.</p> <p>“It’s a burden that falls on volunteers,” said Canales. “It’s usually us who have to deal with the bodies.”</p> <p>Yet Canales and his team of volunteers can only achieve so much. Analysis by the <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/immigration/missing-migrants/\">Center for Public Integrity</a> found that more than 2,000 of the bodies of migrants recovered in the US have not been identified. The National Institute of Justice has called the ongoing tragedy of missing persons, which leaves families unable to properly mourn, the “<a href=\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/missing-persons-and-unidentified-remains-nations-silent-mass\">nation’s silent mass disaster</a>”.</p> <p>Jonathan Alberto Callejas Corado, then 25, disappeared in June 2021 when he was attempting to cross from Mexico through Brooks county. The Guatemalan planned to join his aunt and uncle in Los Angeles, but he has been missing ever since.</p> <p>“We don’t know if he’s alive or dead,” Glenda Corado, his aunt, told the Guardian. “It’s very painful for us. We can’t mourn because we don’t know what happened.”</p> <p>In an attempt to find her lost nephew, last heard from in this remote corner of the nation that has become an open-air cemetery, she has visited the Guatemalan consulate, human rights organisations and even the border patrol headquarters.</p> <p>“We’ve been given no support,” says Corado. “The system is broken. What has happened to our boy?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/19/art-glamping-camping-holidays-somerset-britain-marston-park","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"Fields of light: an arty Somerset glampsite with glowing gardens and a space pod","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/19/art-glamping-camping-holidays-somerset-britain-marston-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/19/art-glamping-camping-holidays-somerset-britain-marston-park","fields":{"headline":"Fields of light: an arty Somerset glampsite with glowing gardens and a space pod","trailText":"Marston Park glampsite is a canvas for budding artists, offering tents with a ‘light garden’, easels, guitars, and live music sets","byline":"Rachel Dixon","body":"<p>Thousands of tiny spheres of light are swaying in a midsummer night’s breeze.

Larger clusters extend into the surrounding ancient woodland. Every tent has a private firepit in a little lakeside clearing; we sat around ours between the flickering flames and the twinkling lights. If inspiration strikes, the tents are equipped with artists’ materials, an easel and a guitar. They also tick all the glamping boxes: double beds and woodburning stoves, with flushing toilets, hot showers and Bramley toiletries.</p> <p>Marston Park is run by two friends, Michael Fenna and Charlie Bonham Christie – Charlie’s family have owned the land since 1905. Their aim is to create a “playground of creativity”, where artists, musicians and writers can come to work (they offer artists’ residencies), while other guests enjoy the views and the arty vibe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80c828945ab3d78fe2bbac88ed0e655963bd535a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80c828945ab3d78fe2bbac88ed0e655963bd535a/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"arts and crafts session\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Regular arts and crafts sessions take place in a nearby glade</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other side of the lake is a converted horse box bar and the Terrace restaurant, an open-sided safari-style structure serving small plates (salt-and-pepper squid £7) and wood-fired pizza (from £10). This is the heart of the site, with DJs on Fridays and Saturdays, and acoustic musicians on Sundays, plus lots of lakeside seating, a jetty and communal firepits. Exhibitions are held here too: a recent display focused on Glastonbury festival (Worthy Farm is a half-hour drive away).</p> <p>Further on is the Hideout, where I joined a yoga class and a sound bath while swans and their cygnets glided across the lake, ducks snoozed on the bank and a heron flapped overhead. There are regular arts and crafts sessions here and in the nearby glade: upcoming workshops include a clothes-mending class and a printmaking day, where participants can design and print their own fabric and turn it into a lampshade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c82b7389a60a290de6c27abb09caaa577df8f05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c82b7389a60a290de6c27abb09caaa577df8f05/0_30_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Futuro House ‘spaceship’ cabin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Futuro House ‘spaceship’ cabin, one of only two in the world in which guests can stay</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This side of the lake is also home to the <a href=\"https://www.futurohouse.co.uk/\">Futuro House</a>, a work of art in itself.

Unsurprisingly, that doesn’t come cheap (from £600 a night for two), but visitors can (and do) gawp at it from the main path, where it is close enough for a photo op.</p> <p>Michael and Charlie plan to add more modern architecture, and to renovate the site’s historic buildings, such as an old boathouse. They are also restoring the landscape, including the lake, which is now too shallow for swimming and boating. However, there is a gorgeous teal-coloured wild pool to swim in, and a wood-fired hot tub (pool free for guests, hot tub £30 for 50 minutes).

Just ask the makers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/27/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-observer-review\">Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/aug/19/actionandadventure\">Snakes on a Plane</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/19/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-jj-abrams-daisy-ridley-adam-driver\">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a>.</p> <p>It’s perhaps no coincidence that at a time when nobody really wanted another Predator movie, the straight-to-streaming prequel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/04/prey-review-predator-prequel-gives-a-nifty-spin-to-a-bloated-franchise\">Prey</a> has reinvigorated interest in the long-running saga. Set in North America in 1719, its less-is-more strategy pays off by pitching the alien against a young Native American woman who must use guile and her understanding of the warrior code to fend off an attack from the mandible-sporting alien.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ7LytagKlc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wZ7LytagKlc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The premise is much more intriguing than the execrable Alien vs Predator movies, and of course the Twittersphere has gone into a predictable loop-the-loop with suggestions for future episodes. Top of the pile is <a href=\"https://movieweb.com/stephen-king-pitches-predator-versus-children-of-the-corn-idea/\">Stephen King’s idea that the extra-terrestrial hunter take on the Children of the Corn</a>, the murderous kids who featured in his 1977 short story (and subsequent torrent of inexplicably bad movies).</p> <p>Is King joking? Who cares! It’s another sideways option that would keep the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/29/prey-predator-native-american-indigenous-characters\">Predator franchise</a> searingly alive. Maybe the alien comes down to Earth in search of “He Who Walks Behind the Rows”, the horrible green demon worshipped by the juvenile citizens of Gatlin in King’s novel, and finds he has bitten off more than he can chew. (Can you chew with mandibles?)</p> <p>Perhaps the evil kiddies get particularly upset at the prospect of a creature walking among them that is centuries older than the 18 or so years marked out as the maximum age for Gatlin’s inhabitants. Do they stuff his tusks with wheat? Could this be like a horror take on Home Alone, except with … you know … extra aliens?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/29/prey-predator-native-american-indigenous-characters\">How the Predator franchise is breaking new ground for Native Americans on screen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I for one want to see it. Could it happen? It’s hard to identify who actually owns the screen rights to Children of the Corn, but surely Disney (which owns Prey’s production company 20th Century Studios) would be in a financial position to bring this to multiplexes?</p> <p>Then again, Disney owns the rights to hundreds of characters that would be excellent in a scrap. What about a Predator vs Mandalorian movie? Who wouldn’t shell out to see the extra-terrestrial warrior take on the Force Ghost of Yoda (Sonic-style, spinning prequels edition), or perhaps the Hulk (let them battle it out on the planet Sakaar, please!) I for one would love to see Predator outwitted by Sid Phillips, Andy’s evil neighbour in the first Toy Story movie, though perhaps we are veering back dangerously close to Children of the Corn/Home Alone territory here.</p> <p>And yet, we really should have learned our lessons by this point. The very reason Predator is interesting to everyone all over again is that the suits didn’t – for once – take the easy option and instead actually bet Prey’s relatively meagre budget on something fresh and original. Yes, the next episode definitely needs to zoom even further away from Planet Obvious if it is to keep us intrigued. Then again, I really, really like the idea of Predator vs Darth Vader.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/hunger-stones-wrecks-and-bones-europe-drought-brings-past-to-surface","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T09:56:57Z","webTitle":"Hunger stones, wrecks and bones: Europe’s drought brings past to surface","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/hunger-stones-wrecks-and-bones-europe-drought-brings-past-to-surface","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/hunger-stones-wrecks-and-bones-europe-drought-brings-past-to-surface","fields":{"headline":"Hunger stones, wrecks and bones: Europe’s drought brings past to surface","trailText":"Receding rivers and lakes have exposed ghost villages, a Nazi vehicle and a Roman fort","byline":"Jon Henley Europe correspondent","body":"<p>The warning could not be starker. <em>Wenn du mich siehst, dann weine</em> (“If you see me, then weep”), reads the grim inscription on a rock in the Elbe River near the northern Czech town of Děčín, close to the German border.</p> <p>As Europe’s rivers run dry in a devastating drought that scientists say could prove the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/13/europes-rivers-run-dry-as-scientists-warn-drought-could-be-worst-in-500-years\">worst in 500 years</a>, their receding waters are revealing long-hidden artefacts, from Roman camps to ghost villages and second world war shipwrecks.</p> <p>The so-called “hunger stone” at Děčín is one of dozens in central European rivers engraved to mark their levels during historic droughts – and warn future generations of the famine and hardship likely to follow each time they became visible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dc93701c060937a2cc89d4a4f1d2fee368cd7ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dc93701c060937a2cc89d4a4f1d2fee368cd7ec/0_241_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The so-called ‘hunger stone’, in Děčín, Czech Republic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ‘hunger stone’, one of the oldest hydrological monuments in central Europe, in Děčín.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Czech researchers <a href=\"https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/9/1985/2013/cp-9-1985-2013.pdf\">in 2013</a> described the stone as “chiselled with the years of hardship and the initials of authors lost to history”, saying it “expressed that drought had brought a bad harvest, lack of food, high prices and hunger for poor people.”</p> <p>The earliest readable year on the Děčín stone is 1616.
