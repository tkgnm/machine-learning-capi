Her husband’s early onset dementia will mean emotional incontinence, aggression, loss of recognition. It’s assumed that Anita’s job will shrink into the far corners of her new life as a carer. From the consultant’s perspective she’s only a cook. “No – I’m a chef,” she says, firmly. That’s what she is and what she does, and it matters as much as the doctor’s work matters to him. A Hunger is the story of how Anita confronts the conflicting demands of work and care, how she weighs past wrongs and present duties, and how she faces the desperately difficult questions that dominate the small hours of so many carers whose partners have asked not to be left suffering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ross Raisin made his name in 2008 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview40\">God’s Own Country</a>, vividly narrated in the strong Yorkshire dialect of a disturbed young man adrift. It was so pungent that readers expected more from that same rural world. Instead, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/13/waterline-ross-raisin-review\">Waterline</a> (2011) we got a Clyde shipbuilder enduring the loneliness of grief. Then came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/09/a-natural-ross-raisin-review\">A Natural</a> (2017), with its subtly sustained portrait of a gay footballer carrying on his career in the lower leagues where the spotlights don’t reach. Each time, the immersion in particular circumstances is so complete that I have caught myself wondering if Raisin is a farmer, a shipbuilder, a footballer, a carer. Then I remember with relief that I don’t need to know: he is a novelist.</p> <p>Anita in A Hunger has always found satisfaction in her work, from her first teaching job and time as a canteen dinner lady, to the years of fierce effort pushing her way up the kitchen hierarchy, cooking “immaculately murdered wild birds” for drunken businessmen, until at last she is senior sous chef at a respected London restaurant. At every turn she has been made to feel guilty for doing what she loves, or held back from it altogether. Her controlling husband has left the parenting of two children in her hands, never hesitating to put in the hours for his own promotion while she looks after everything at home. The standards are double by default. “Do you know how long I have worked to get us where we are?” rants Patrick when Anita proposes to risk some of their capital to start a business. “About as long as me, at a guess,” comes the answer, in Anita’s preferred tone of understated resistance. She is no one’s victim. But Patrick’s punishment of her has gone beyond casual degradation to an extraordinary kind of persecution.</p> <p>So when she is left changing the incontinence pads, it is for a man who has hardly earned her generosity. But does “earning” have anything to do with it? Perhaps the economies of care and sacrifice do not behave like that. Anita moves between frustration, compassion, fraught exhaustion and a love that “punches blindly” – because, yes, they have loved each other, this husband and wife.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Raisin honours the ‘ordinary’ stories he tells – these are complicated lives, not amenable to summings up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Episodes from the past are interleaved with the unfolding situation, so that we come to understand the experiences that shape Anita’s judgments now. It’s all told in the present tense, with the past pressing up against the surface, equally immediate in its hurts and joys. In truth there’s more incident and characterisation than we might require. A few suggestive glimpses could have sufficed for Peter, say, the gently patient vegetable seller with whom a new relationship is forming. But Raisin’s fullness is part of his honouring of the “ordinary” stories he tells. These are complicated lives, not amenable to symbolic hints or summings up.</p> <p>The fact that Anita has been a carer before is almost too much for one novel to hold, yet it rings absolutely true. As a girl she was responsible for feeding, dressing and emotionally supporting her beloved and loving mother. Terribly trapped and out of options, her mother asked several times for money to buy pills that would “help”, releasing her from misery. The memory of it accompanies all Anita’s thinking, in her 50s, about what she should and shouldn’t do for her husband.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the kitchen becomes a precious place where she can both think and close off thought. She appreciates the “concentrated peace of prep” when everyone is absorbed in allotted tasks. She has held her own in kitchens run on Gordon Ramsay principles of adrenaline and macho language, and her reward is now to manage her team differently. There’s the pleasure of things done well (“viscosity just right”), and she thrills to the honed choreography of dinner service. The routine hum of it makes a kind of music:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Three minutes on table twelve! Anton – duck happy?”<br>“Duck happy, Chef.”<br>“Sauce happy, Jack?”<br>“Sauce happy, Chef.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Raisin has never dealt overtly in stylistic experiment, but what he does with language is bold when he mobilises the technical slang and in-jokes of colleagues working together – on the football pitch in A Natural or perfecting dishes here in A Hunger.</p> <p>The rich subject matter he finds by the fridges and on the metal at “the pass” where food is plated and checked for service makes one realise the degree to which work is still undercharted territory in literary fiction. A hundred years after Ulysses there have been few novels about advertising salesmen. Francis Spufford’s pitch-perfect study of printers, teachers and middling executives in 2021’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/22/light-perpetual-by-francis-spufford-review\">Light Perpetual</a> felt rare and welcome. Raisin is another writer giving literature new jobs.</p> <p>His own central job in A Hunger, though, is to set the rhythms and challenges of the kitchen alongside those of illness, marriage, motherhood and care. It’s a giant task. If the novel sometimes feels a little laboured, it is a superb achievement nonetheless. This is fiction put to work on some of the hardest and, alas, most commonplace ethical dilemmas about value, choice and freedom.</p> <p><em>• </em>A Hunger by Ross Raisin is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

But Eklund was not deterred. “I thought: go big or go home.” So she went for 5,000 in her second shipment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd76f60e0231a8e560c3ea3edb9b75985ba55502\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd76f60e0231a8e560c3ea3edb9b75985ba55502/2009_112_2831_2831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Eklund is the founder of Noble Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sara Eklund founder of Noble Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesimiel Boh/Noble Cup</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a new hitch. Erca categorised the product as a luxury item, and imposed a 69% tax. “It was madness,” says Eklund. “The system is made to infuriate and frustrate.”</p> <p>With some determination from Eklund, <a href=\"https://noblecup.com/\">Noble Cup</a> is now on sale in more than 30 shops across the capital, Addis Ababa, with plans to expand.</p> <p>At 230 birr (£3.50), the cups are prohibitively expensive for most women and girls in Ethiopia, where only<a href=\"https://www.pmadata.org/sites/default/files/data_product_results/PMA2020-Ethiopia-R5-MHM-Brief.pdf\"> 28% of women</a> report having “everything they need” to manage their periods, and 25% do not use any form of sanitary product, relying instead on whatever they can find: rags, newspaper, even cloths filled with ash.</p> <p>Eklund hopes that promoting the product will help encourage a more open discussion, and reduce the stigma and shame around menstrual health. “This is something every single woman goes through every month,” she says.</p> <p>But shame is deeply embedded, says Mekdim Hailu, campaigner at WaterAid Ethiopia. “Pharmacists still hand sanitary pads to customers in newspaper and a plastic bag. Even as young women in an urban area, my friends and I still use code words for periods.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/13/cloth-cow-dung-cups-how-the-worlds-women-manage-their-periods\">Cloth, cow dung, cups: how the world’s women manage their periods</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hailu welcomes cups as an eco-friendly alternative but says even those who could afford to buy them – and have access to clean water – may avoid them for cultural reasons.</p> <p>“We want girls and women to have many choices, but it’s a foreign concept to put an external product inside your vagina – even tampons are not used here – so there is a lot to be done in terms of awareness of this [product].”</p> <p>Born in Virginia to an Ethiopian mother and American father, Eklund went to high school in Ethiopia but returned to the US for college. She was inspired to start her business after her own discovery of menstrual cups, a “eureka moment” in her freshman year.</p> <p>She considered launching a charity to provide cups for free, but her mother, a businesswoman, knocked that idea down. “She told me, ‘If it’s going to be anything, it has to be a business – this concept that Africans just need free stuff is wrong.’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac237ce043c3a232746b14b118e1d4ea2decd7ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac237ce043c3a232746b14b118e1d4ea2decd7ce/223_296_2801_2801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noble Cup billboard ad in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A billboard advertising Noble Cup in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noble Cup</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“She was right,” says Eklund. “I don’t think donating the cups would have had the same power. When women choose to buy a product, they are more invested in it. They will share stories about it. That’s when behavioural change comes.”</p> <p>Eklund’s team runs basic biology workshops in schools, introducing children to period products. They are also active on social media.</p> <p>“It’s no coincidence that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/11/periods-menstruation-liberation-women-activists-abigail-radnor\">rise of the menstrual movement</a> has coincided with the growth of social media,” says Eklund.

He explains that, having spent the previous month there as a military analyst, he felt compelled to defend democracy and could not stand by as innocent civilians faced slaughter.</p> <p>Nance confidently reels off the names of Ukrainian generals, key battlegrounds and pieces of military hardware. He is a former navy senior chief petty officer who knew what it was like to be under fire in Afghanistan and Iraq. But he is also a 60-year-old grandfather. Has life on the eastern front been scary?</p> <p>He says: “The thing that is hairiest of all is artillery. One incident we had at three in the morning – I was tweeting and I guess the Russians didn’t like what I was tweeting – when they hit us with extremely large calibre weapons, long range too, fired from southern Russia into the north-east. They didn’t kill any of us but they missed us by a hundred metres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"020c39acaf12bd3cc2924671ac854ef14f1771e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020c39acaf12bd3cc2924671ac854ef14f1771e4/0_0_517_798/324.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Nance\" width=\"324\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>“That’s a dangerously close hit.

Our little war puppies, our little battle dogs, were panicking – it’s the biggest fireworks you have – but your job is to remain calm<em>.”</em></p> <p>The international legion is a combat force of three battalions and several hundred personnel. It is defending a significant portion of the frontline and has suffered casualties. When Nance’s presence was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/29/malcolm-nance-msnbc-pundit-ukraine-soldier-michael-harriot\">made public in April</a>, he was told that the Kremlin had denounced him as a mercenary, soldier of fortune and legionnaire enemy number one.</p> <p>When a head of Ukrainian intelligence informed him, “Vladimir Putin knows your name now,” Nance responded: “Cool!”</p> <p>Having given up a five-figure-a-month salary as a pundit on the liberal <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/\">MSNBC cable news network</a>, he is earning the same wage as other Ukrainian soldiers: $630 a month. “So I am definitely not a mercenary. If anything, I’m paying them. I’ve bought so much gear, trucks.</p> <p>“I have wonderful donors who have helped us out greatly and we get what we need because it’s faster than the logistics pipeline. In a year, we’ll get what we need if we’re waiting on the Ukrainian army and the US government, but now we need things now, so we just buy them.”</p> <p>Nance is also donating $100,000 from the advance for his book to ensure the legionnaires have the equipment they need. The volume’s cover – an ersatz gallows erected outside the US Capitol <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/06/trump-mob-capitol-clash-police-washington\">on 6 January 2021</a>, with a skull and crossbones flag and Trump flag nearby – makes clear that the existential threat to democracy is not confined to eastern Europe.</p> <p>“I call Ukraine the eastern model in the battle for the defense of democracy and the United States is the western wall,” he reflects. “The western wall is crumbling.”</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250279002/theywanttokillamericans\">They Want to Kill Americans</a>, Nance argues that the threat from domestic terrorists, the Republican party and former president Donald Trump is even worse than you already think. He suggests that an insurgency was under way well before January 6 and that the 74 million people who voted for Trump were by definition expressing hostility towards American democracy.</p> <p>In his introduction, Nance describes the book as a warning: the US may again come under a wave of terrorist attacks but this time from within its own borders. Significant numbers of Americans, he argues, are radicalizing, arming and planning to kill their compatriots to install a dictatorship.</p> <p>To some it will sound like hyperbole. But dozens of Trump acolytes who promote his lies about the 2020 election and themselves <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-120-republicans-who-deny-the-2020-election-results-will-be-on-the-ballot-in-november/\">winning Republican primaries</a> are hoping to take control of election machinery in key states. Trump himself recently said he had <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-2024-decision.html\">made up his mind</a> about whether to run for president again in 2024 (take that as a yes).</p> <p>And this week a survey by medical and public health scientists at the University of California found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/19/one-in-five-us-adults-condone-political-violence-survey\">one in five adults</a> in the US, equivalent to about 50 million people, believe that political violence is justified at least in some circumstances.</p> <p>“They are our neighbors and they are collectively called the Titus, which stands for the Trump Insurgency in the United States,” Nance says.</p> <p>“The Republican party is an insurgent party, no longer interested in government but using the levers of power to damage government and destabilize government and reflect the wishes of the armed insurgents, the militias, even the terrorists. They themselves are the knife at the throat of American democracy.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"193b0bbb874c93288a516134f7ba5af11fb6f192\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/193b0bbb874c93288a516134f7ba5af11fb6f192/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters break through barricades on their way to the Capitol Building on 6 January 2021\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters break through barricades on their way to the Capitol building on 6 January 2021</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Harris/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, he says, there is the average Trump voter. “In the insurrection at the Capitol, the actual militiamen were a fraction of the people that were there. Forty thousand people showed up at the Mall, 10,000 laid siege to the Capitol and fought the police, and 2,000 entered the building in force. Maybe 10% of them were militiamen.</p> <p>“That means that there was an entire insurgent wing of average Americans that want to take part in the violence and are intimidating people with their firearms at these rallies and protests.”</p> <p>America’s diversifying demographics, highlighted in bold by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/21/decade-that-shook-america-donald-trump-barack-obama-us-politics-race-division\">the election of Barack Obama</a>, the first Black president, have fanned flames of white supremacy and grievance that never went away. Trump took away the shackles of civility and decency and offered the thrill of saying the unsayable.</p> <p>“He removed all of the restraints and said it’s OK to be racist openly, it’s OK to hurt people, it’s OK to get in their face. It’s OK to call an average person just walking down the street or doing their job in elections ‘anti-American, not American’.”</p> <p>Nance, whose previous books include <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?405971-4/washington-journal-malcolm-nance-defeating-isis\">Defeating Isis</a>, An End to al-Qaeda and The Terrorists of Iraq, draws a provocative comparison. “Isis has this ideological belief that was quite simple: unless you are in our group, you are no longer a Muslim and we can kill you. You’re all infidels until you re-pledge yourself to our variation of Islam: join us, pray the way we pray, behave the way we behave, support our operations.</p> <p>“The same thing with the Republican party behaving very much like Isis: ideological purity and creating a terror state or an insurgency where the country now is used for what they want. They don’t care about the other 65%.”</p> <p>Joe Biden has said he was motivated to run for president by the sight of white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/biden-trump-january-6-capitol-attack-democracy-analysis\">He has given speeches</a> vowing to shore up democracy against existential threats from China, Russia and domestic extremists. But Nance does not think the president and his allies are rising to the occasion.</p> <p>“They have no urgency right now,” he warns. “This is a firehouse on fire and you’re sitting in the truck waiting for the call. Get out and fight the fire. The entire structure can collapse around you.</p> <p>“They need to be screaming as loud as I am and they need to be speaking in stark terms like I am. Joe Biden needs to say to the attorney general – or fire the attorney general and get somebody there – ‘I will not tell him what to do but by God he will defend American democracy. You will hold people to account and this administration will hold people to account and we won’t let this heinous attack on democracy take hold’.</p> <p>“But a lot of people there are institutionalists and they want to come back and try to reach out and show comity with their peers. These people are sharpening knives in their House and Senate office groups. They don’t care about civil discourse. They are planning to seize power or be elected into power and then never relinquish it again.”</p> <p>The congressional committee investigating January 6 has pointed the finger firmly at Trump and given plenty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/13/trump-pressure-capitol-attack-january-6\">hints about premeditation and culpability</a> to nudge the attorney general, Merrick Garland, towards a criminal prosecution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac0b5251dcbc71ed73c060a5d12802fe91ef03cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac0b5251dcbc71ed73c060a5d12802fe91ef03cf/0_0_1875_2850/658.jpg\" alt=\"They Want to Kill Americans book cover\" width=\"658\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Nance, who is Black, continues: “This was a seditious conspiracy. There’s an entire article in the constitution about this<em>. </em>They could close and engage upon the Capitol and beat cops because their skin was their camouflage. Now the whiteness of their skin is the excuse that you can’t hold them to account but you can shoot Black men with no weapon 90 times in the back.</p> <p>“So no, the justice department should make it clear: equal under the law. This whole ‘Oh, well, we can’t do this in the election season’ bullshit? They did it for years in the election season. Breaking the law is breaking the law so we hold people to account.”</p> <p>At the start of this year the Washington commentariat overflowed with speculation that America, bitterly polarised, awash with guns and steeped in a history of violence, could even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/is-the-us-really-heading-for-a-second-civil-war\">plunge into a second civil war</a>. Since the supreme court decision overturning a woman’s constitutional rights to abortion has made the division between blue and red states even more concrete.</p> <p>What does Nance think? “If it happens, it won’t be a second civil war. It’ll be an insurgency, which is a series of incidents, and those incidents will look like attacks: people seizing governor’s mansions but this time the governors are on their side, or taking statehouses and the state uses the national guard to support them.</p> <p>“There’ll be a challenge between federalism and states’ rights and they’ll point to the supreme court that says we have states’ rights. The supreme court practically ruled that the supremacy clause [giving federal laws priority over state laws] doesn’t exist and, even if it does, they’re going to argue it doesn’t and back it up with guns.

As wildfires raged, and people lost everything as their homes were burnt to the ground, the two candidates to become our next prime minister were talking more about economic growth than tackling the climate crisis.”</p> <p>Ramsay called for a shift away from standard economic measures such as GDP, which rewards the overuse of resources and fails to account for factors such as people’s wellbeing and happiness.</p> <p>Ramsay said: “Unfortunately, successive governments have for too long focused on economic growth at all costs, without acknowledging that it’s the quality of our economy that matters, not just the quantity. A narrow focus solely on economic growth will exacerbate the climate crisis and worsen social inequalities.”</p> <p>Many economists are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/17/is-time-to-end-our-fixation-with-gdp-and-growth\">unhappy with GDP as the sole benchmark of success in the economy</a>, and have called for a broader suite of measures that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/economic-crisis-degrowth-green-new-deal\">take into account people’s wellbeing</a> and the impact of human activities on the planet. Ramsay said making changes to the way the UK’s success was measured would benefit everyone.</p> <p>“This requires a shift away from chasing economic growth only, and instead measuring the success of our economy by how it maximises people’s happiness without exceeding planetary boundaries. It also means policies to tackle the scourge of inequality and ensure we share the Earth’s resources fairly,” he said.</p> <p>He also pointed to estimates of “Earth overshoot day”, the date when humanity has used all the biological resources that the planet can regenerate within a year. This year, that falls on Thursday. All resources used beyond this point are beyond what the Earth can naturally sustain, and all carbon dioxide emitted from this point is not absorbed but pours into the atmosphere to keep heating the planet for up to a century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ramsay said: “On Earth overshoot day, I am calling on the Conservative leadership candidates to commit to broadening their focus from economic growth and show how they will ensure that the UK lives within our planetary means within the next 10 years.</p> <p>“Our government should be working across the board to ensure we’re leading the way on pushing back Earth overshoot day further every year.”</p> <p>Earth overshoot day has generally been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/23/earths-resources-consumed-in-ever-greater-destructive-volumes\">getting earlier every year</a> – in 2010 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/aug/19/earth-overshoot-day-environmental-debt\">fell on 21 August</a>.

Peeking just above it is the renovated library and, inside the hall, a first world war roll of honour bears the words: “There was none that gave them an ill-word, for they feared God greatly … So they passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for them on the other side.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/7f9ea033bcdaec511512a06d8242e79d9d868c82/0_0_5906_3937/500.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/7f9ea033bcdaec511512a06d8242e79d9d868c82/0_0_5906_3937/2000.jpg&amp;label_before=&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5807ed01b6ec39682d8083aa84700c857d14ffb4/0_0_5906_3937/500.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5807ed01b6ec39682d8083aa84700c857d14ffb4/0_0_5906_3937/2000.jpg&amp;label_after=&amp;analytics_label=The Hall of Memory in Centenary Square, Birmingham&amp;type=duo&amp;\" data-alt=\"The Hall of Memory in Centenary Square, Birmingham\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/7f9ea033bcdaec511512a06d8242e79d9d868c82/0_0_5906_3937/500.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/7f9ea033bcdaec511512a06d8242e79d9d868c82/0_0_5906_3937/2000.jpg&label_before=&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5807ed01b6ec39682d8083aa84700c857d14ffb4/0_0_5906_3937/500.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5807ed01b6ec39682d8083aa84700c857d14ffb4/0_0_5906_3937/2000.jpg&label_after=&analytics_label=The Hall of Memory in Centenary Square, Birmingham&type=duo&\">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Simon Webster/Alamy</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>13.

Ethiopian police officers stopped his bus on the outskirts of the city. Onboard were 140 Eritreans who had been visiting a monastery.</p> <p>“They rounded up only those of us who speak Tigrinya [the language of Eritreans and Tigrayans]. Other than the refugees, there were scores of Eritreans with European, Canada, US and UK passports. They took our belongings and forced us into another bus.</p> <p>“They did not tell us about our ‘crime’. They would not listen when everyone showed their UNHCR [UN refugee agency] ID and passports,” said Berket.</p> <p>“We refused to get into the bus since the police officers did not give us any explanation. But the officers beat and intimidated us. There was also a mob of ordinary people verbally assaulting us.

It is scary as there are many violent militias in the area. They arbitrarily arrested me and arbitrarily released me. There is no law and order.”</p> <p>In testimonies shared with the Guardian, the refugees blamed the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, for failing to protect their rights.

They loot and abduct people. You don’t know who is going to attack you,” said Lewam*, another refugee forcibly relocated from Addis Ababa.</p> <p>“It is not even safe for the locals themselves. There is no water or food in the camp, and the shelters are in poor condition. </p> <p>“I had finished the visa process and was expecting to travel to Norway last week. But now I am forced to live here, left in an uncertain situation.”</p> <p>Kidan*, who had been living in Addis Ababa for seven years, said the UNHCR had failed her. “I fled to Ethiopia, relying on UNHCR promises.

It is the year 6000. Humanity has abandoned its bodily form and lives on a USB stick. Sentient bipedal rats roam the earth on hoverboards. Great lava pools have replaced the oceans, and nobody knows what a tree is. Somewhere in what remains of the UK, something looks at a menu, ponders for a moment, and orders a McDonald’s cheeseburger for 99p.</p> <p>Or so you might have expected until yesterday, when the fast food giant announced a change to one of those prices that seemed written in stone: after 14 years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/mcdonalds-uk-raises-price-of-cheeseburger-for-first-time-in-14-years\">the era of the sub-£1 cheeseburger is over</a>. The company said it had protected consumers from increased costs for as long as it could, and the price had to go up to £1.19. There will be increases to a range of other items like McFlurrys, fries, and large meals – but it’s the totemic burger that sticks in your head.</p> <p>Energy prices are going to be the biggest pressure for most households: only yesterday, it was forecast that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/27/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-3850-pounds-russia-cuts-gas-supply-further-europe-pipeline\">bills will reach £3,850 per year by Christmas</a>. But the way that this price change resonates, and how it compares with other increases in different parts of the economy, tells us some important things about another aspect of how the cost of living crisis is developing. For today’s newsletter, I’ve spoken with economist and author Duncan Weldon about handbags, video games, and the meaning of a 99p cheeseburger. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Strikes</strong></em><strong> </strong>| Unions warned the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/27/train-drivers-vote-for-fresh-strikes-as-disruptions-hit-britains-rail-network\">could face a general strike this year</a> as rail workers voted for fresh action.

In one sense, that’s true: there’s no ambassador for inflation to hold talks with, and no button to switch it off.</p> <p>In another very blunt way, though, it isn’t true: almost any time an item’s price goes up, that’s because somebody, somewhere, has decided to charge more for it. The McDonald’s hamburger hasn’t stayed 99p for 14 years because its recipe happened to feature the only combination of ingredients where costs haven’t changed: it’s stayed there because McDonald’s has decided it’s worth holding the price down and absorbing those costs itself.</p> <p>Duncan Weldon, author of a new history of the British economy, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/two-hundred-years-of-muddling-through-9780349144276\">Two Hundred Years of Muddling Through</a>, and the <a href=\"https://duncanweldon.substack.com/\">Value Added</a> newsletter on Substack, said that the price change “will not have been an easy decision for them to make at all.

And you never know which are the things that are going to become the examples that get picked up by, for example, the Guardian morning email.” That’s influence for you, eh.</p> <p>From luxury goods to fast food, the tipping points for price hikes will come at very different stages.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Chanel small classic handbag</p> <p><strong>2019</strong> <a href=\"https://lvbagaholic.com/blogs/lv_bagaholic/chanel-bags-price-increase-us-uk-and-europe-2019\">£3,810</a><br><strong>Today</strong> <a href=\"https://www.chanel.com/gb/fashion/p/A01113Y01864C3906/small-classic-handbag-grained-calfskin-gold-tone-metal/\">£6,510</a></p> <p>Well, look, this <em>might</em> be an area you have to make a cutback. “On any sort of luxury good, the producer has an awful lot of pricing power,” said Weldon. “All of their costs will have soared: price inflation for producers is running well ahead of consumer price inflation. Lots of firms have been taking a margin hit. But they don’t have the same issue with passing that on to the consumer.”</p> <p>That’s because, obviously, if you want a Chanel bag, you want a <em>Chanel</em> bag, and you’re unlikely to pick a Primark one instead. Then there’s the fact that, at a certain level, the price becomes a reassuring status symbol in itself (just like the fact that you’re <a href=\"https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/chanel-to-limit-sales-of-its-bags-to-bolster-exclusivity/2021101258353\">limited to buying one a year</a>). The demand is ‘inelastic’ – that is, people who think nothing of a £3,800 handbag are probably pretty comfortable with a £6,500 one as well.</p> <p>This is useful, in part, as an example of what simply isn’t possible in other parts of the economy. “If you’re selling mass market items competing with lots of others, you don’t have the luxury of simply passing all the costs on without thinking about it,” Weldon said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Video games</p> <p><strong>Goldeneye, Nintendo 64, 1997</strong> Around £60<br><strong>Fifa 22, XBox One, 2022</strong> <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9510553?istCompanyId=a74d8886-5df9-4baa-b776-166b3bf9111c&amp;istFeedId=c290d9a9-b5d6-423c-841d-2a559621874c&amp;istItemId=piarqqmra&amp;istBid=t&amp;&amp;cmpid=GS001&amp;_$ja=tsid:59157%7cacid:534-693-8244%7ccid:16586469281%7cagid:137424042631%7ctid:pla-882619520147%7ccrid:587991330707%7cnw:u%7crnd:3853626449593719309%7cdvc:c%7cadp:%7cmt:%7cloc:9045997&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=16586469281&amp;utm_term=9510553&amp;utm_content=shopping&amp;utm_custom1=137424042631&amp;utm_custom2=534-693-8244&amp;GPDP=true&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCbyjyOlbKCKpdH2BUetBn6UTMjABiIl-iQ3oKKvNWWuuy54BWilILkaAl4AEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">£59.99</a></p> <p>Those of us of a certain age and level of nerdery may remember £60 console titles in the 90s; despite vastly increased levels of complexity and corresponding budgets, so-called ‘AAA’ games are about the same price today. If they had risen with inflation, they’d be around £120 – so it’s a real-terms price cut of about 50%. But that era may be ending.</p> <p>“Until this bout of inflation, the story in advanced economies has been that the price of goods have effectively been falling, and services have become a bit more expensive,” Weldon said. “That’s a story of technological change, of outsourcing manufacturing and deeper globalisation. But with a severe supply chain crunch, that’s reversing.”</p> <p>As the pandemic started to bite at the end of 2020, games manufacturers in the US began <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years\">what they viewed as a long overdue effort</a> to raise the typical price from $60 to $70, while new and confusing revenue sources within games like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/17/uk-will-not-ban-video-games-loot-boxes-despite-problem-gambling-findings\">“loot boxes”</a> and expansion packs are pushing spending up in a way that doesn’t appear in the retail price.</p> <p>The pandemic is a huge factor on the demand side, too. “We saw this big shift in consumer spending patterns,” Weldon said. “Your typical consumer is spending a lot less than they’re used to on services, the pub or a haircut, and a lot more on goods. And all of that pushed prices up as well.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lurpak slightly salted spreadable 500g</p> <p><strong>Average UK supermarket price 2021</strong> £3.53 <br><strong>Average UK supermarket price 2022</strong> £4.87</p> <p>You might have seen stories a few weeks ago about this 38% increase, according to research firm Assosia; the grabbier detail came in<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharIieBennett/status/1544220457611808768\"> a social media post</a> showing 750g tubs for £6 in Asda with security tags on. It isn’t just about butter, obviously: most staples have gone up in supermarkets, which have extremely low margins within which to absorb increases in costs.</p> <p>At the same time, said Weldon, it’s important to note that “Britain has had the cheapest food in western Europe for a long time. But now [retailers] are faced with a situation where you can’t squeeze the production costs any more, or your suppliers will go out of business.”</p> <p>You won’t ever see a press release announcing an item’s price rise at Tesco or Sainsbury’s: their prices change constantly, with “huge amounts of data on the impact and confidence about how it will affect demand.” Supermarkets will prioritise keeping certain high profile staples – like a pint of milk or a loaf of bread – as low as they possibly can. “They don’t like to put prices up for things which consumers notice,” Weldon said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>McDonald’s cheeseburger</p> <p><strong>2008 – July 25 2022</strong> 99p<br><strong>July 26 2022</strong> £1.19</p> <p>“Behavioural economists think about anchoring points on prices,” said Weldon - and 99p is a very important one. “In the same way, it was the Pret 99p filter coffee <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lets-talk-about-our-addiction-to-cheap-money-s0kwh3f26\">until recently</a>.” And, obviously, even when inflation was around 2%, McDonald’s was effectively cutting the price each year.</p> <p>In the past, that’s been worthwhile as a branding tool and loss leader to get customers through the door even if Big Tasty meals are creeping up. “They will have wanted to keep this down for as long as they could,” Weldon said. Painful though it is for the company, it has another future benefit: the next increases of a few pennies will be easier to make without putting people off.</p> <p>Just as there was never anything altruistic about the 99p price, there’s nothing particularly wicked about £1.19, either. “It’s important to step back, and say why is this happening?” Weldon said. “It’s happening because we had a pandemic, global supply chains are broken, war in Europe is making energy and food more expensive, and so the country is poorer. It’s not a story of greedy corporates’ decisions, or greedy workers demanding more, or stupid bankers printing too much money. It’s because real things have happened.”</p> <p>“The policy debate should be about how we allocate that pain best among firms, households, different people,” Weldon said. “And instead the political debate we have is how do we make it go away.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/27/tire-deflators-suv-new-york-climate-crisis\">Oliver Milman follows</a> the <strong>Gen-Z environmental activists</strong> who’ve turned their ire to gas guzzling SUVs.

It can be performed up to 24 hours after a stroke, but is most effective in the first six hours.</p> <p>But the report warns that NHS England has missed its target to make mechanical thrombectomy available to all the patients it could benefit – only delivering to 28% of all suitable patients by December 2021.</p> <p>The procedure can reduce hospital stays by months. Some patients have been able to leave hospital the next day, instead of spending months in rehabilitation units.</p> <p>Stroke specialists say a 24/7 service would save £73m a year due to the reduced costs of looking after people with stroke. But just 25% of thrombectomy centres operate as such, while 42% are only open from Monday to Friday during office hours, the report says, in part due to a lack of biplane suites, which contain specific radiology equipment.</p> <p>Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association, said: “Thrombectomy is a miracle treatment that pulls patients back from near death and alleviates the worst effects of stroke.</p> <p>“It’s shocking that so many patients are missing out and being saddled with unnecessary disability. Tens of thousands will miss out if rates stay the same as in 2020/21.</p> <p>“There are hard-working clinicians across the stroke pathway facing an uphill struggle to provide this treatment and it’s time they got the support they need to make this happen. It really is simple.”</p> <p>The procedure is one of the most effective ever discovered for stroke and is suitable for about 10% of all patients, the Stroke Association said. There are 75,000 strokes in England every year.</p> <p>The report also revealed an “unacceptable postcode lottery” in care, with almost 8% of stroke patients receiving thrombectomy in London, compared with 0% to 3% in other parts of England.</p> <p>Treatment rates are also kept low by ambulance delays and slow handovers of patients to A&amp;E.</p> <p>Prof Martin James, a consultant stroke physician at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS foundation trust and a clinical trustee of the Stroke Association, said: “Thrombectomy really is a gamechanging treatment, yet the number of people receiving the treatment in the UK remains much lower than elsewhere in Europe, and has been only slowly increasing over recent years.</p> <p>“At this rate, it won’t be available to all those who could benefit for many years to come.”</p> <p>An NHS England spokesperson said: “By bringing services together through newly created stroke networks, we are supporting local clinicians to deliver 24/7 access to thrombectomy, clot-busting drugs and other lifesaving specialist stroke services in every part of the country, so if you experience stroke symptoms, it’s vital that you call 999 immediately.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “We are growing the health and social care workforce, with over 4,000 more doctors and 9,600 more nurses compared to last year, and over 1,400 more doctors in general practice compared to March 2019.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/jul/28/ian-cognito-comedian-died-on-stage-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"‘Standup was a weapon to him’: Ian Cognito, the comedian who died on stage – literally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/28/ian-cognito-comedian-died-on-stage-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jul/28/ian-cognito-comedian-died-on-stage-documentary","fields":{"headline":"‘Standup was a weapon to him’: Ian Cognito, the comedian who died on stage – literally","trailText":"Three years ago, the caustic comic had a fatal aortic dissection mid-show.

Singing his praises in the film are the likes of James Acaster, Shaparak Khorsandi and Stewart Lee. Some are a little more equivocal. Jo Brand calls him “a loose cannon”. Bob Mills says: “Standup comedy was a weapon to Cogs. It wasn’t a nice thing.”</p> <p>Those familiar with Cognito will recall that he began many of his gigs by banging a nail into the wall and then hanging his hat on it, before turning to the audience. “Now you know two things about me,” he would bark. “First, I don’t give a shit. And second, I’ve got a hammer.” He also threw a television set out of a Birmingham hotel window. His explanation? “Room service was late.” Alcoholism and mental health issues drove this sort of behaviour. Cognito rarely performed without several pints inside him and another one in his hand, and he was honest about the corrosive effects of his stage persona. “He’s in danger of killing me, my Mr Hyde,” he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZP-IKEYnL8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sZP-IKEYnL8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Danny Ward and Joe Bor, the standups who directed the documentary, have fond memories of him. “Cogs and I did a festival together where he nicked a bottle of rum from the bar and then ate a chicken out of a bin,” Ward tells me. Bor chips in: “We took turns hosting one weekend at the Glee club in Cardiff. Cogs said: ‘The audience really likes you. They don’t like me.’ But then again, he had just called them all cunts, so …”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was playing a character who had no filter. And sometimes the things he said were quite shocking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cognito could craft an exemplary one-liner. He railed against people with disabilities “using our spaces in the car park. If you let them get away with it, they’ll be in our toilets next.” But the bracing, heady flavour of a Cognito set was never about individual gags. “No one knew what the hell he was going to do or say,” says his son, Will Barbieri. “The adrenaline was incredible. When he was on form, it was as much a theme park ride as it was a gig.”</p> <p>The comic Becky Fury agrees. “Being in the room with him was electrifying,” she says. Her first encounter with Cognito was about 15 years ago, when she was 19. “My boyfriend did some comedy promoting at a theatre. Paul came on stage and started hammering a nail in the wall. I’m sure there are a lot of people who would be like: ‘Don’t go anywhere near that guy.’ But I found it very attractive. He was this powerful, charismatic, sexy presence. We had a fling, so that was the end of him ever performing at that venue again!” It wasn’t the last time he helped Fury end an ailing relationship by going to bed with her. As she wrote after his death: “He had an uncanny knack of appearing when he was needed, like a swaggering cockney genie that lives in a bottle of Jameson’s.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bfa368db388bbd2e4eda7891654c1f37f81bf770\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa368db388bbd2e4eda7891654c1f37f81bf770/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from the documentary Ian Cognito, a Life and Death on Stage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘He had something otherworldly about him’ … Cognito.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Journeyman Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though Cognito’s relationship with the audience was uniformly combative, it could sometimes seem as though women bore the brunt of his opprobrium. “I don’t think we’re gonna be seeing you in the next episode of Baywatch, are we?” he asked a woman in the front row at one gig. Fury says that audiences back then were better equipped for this abrasive approach. “They could deal with banter,” she says. “Whereas today, you’ve got a generation who didn’t play out enough as kids. They’re not exposed to that sort of thing so it seems more outrageous.”</p> <p>For all that its makers admire Cognito, the documentary is no hagiography. “Cogs did alienate people,” says Ward. “He was flawed, like all of us.” The ultimate target of his comedy, though, was usually himself, as that joke about parking spaces makes clear. Lee puts it nicely in the film: Cognito, he explains, was “the person of low status” in any routine. Ward also draws a distinction between man and persona. “Paul<strong> </strong>Barbieri was playing a character called Ian Cognito who had no filter. And sometimes the things he said were quite shocking.”</p> <p>Rarely more so than in his lacerating set at the Glastonbury festival in 1999. In a brazen instance of audience-baiting, he immediately insulted the Manic Street Preachers, who had played a headline set the previous evening, then silenced a heckler by explaining what happened to the last person who interrupted him: “I followed her home, waited up all night and shot her on her fucking doorstep, so bear it in mind.” No wonder the crowd gasped – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/02/the-murder-of-jill-dando-review\">the murder of Jill Dando</a> less than two months earlier was still fresh in the memory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20440fa83fe8af302bcc5d835667be0e66e60007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20440fa83fe8af302bcc5d835667be0e66e60007/0_179_2964_1778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘The last of a dying breed’ … on stage in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The last of a dying breed’ … on stage in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ward flinches when I mention that moment, which isn’t in the documentary. “You told me to cut that one out, Joe,” he reminds his co-director. “We didn’t want to whitewash Cogs, which is why there’s a whole section about his flaws, but that kind of clip could easily have capsized the film.”</p> <p>A standup who thrived on the crackle of danger unique to live comedy was never going to be a snug fit for TV. Cognito was scathing about those who were. Will believes his father’s distaste for the medium was authentic. “He hated the idea of selling out. His anarchist, nonconformist streak wouldn’t have let him do it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"987357c1f3d18df701aeec11cdec8b83d80ad944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/987357c1f3d18df701aeec11cdec8b83d80ad944/220_0_960_1200/800.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Ward and Joe Bor, standups and directors of Ian Cognito\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Ward and Joe Bor, directors of Ian Cognito: A Life and a Death on Stage</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Bor, this made him “even more popular among his peers. He was a God of the circuit.” Some comics, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/05/daniel-kitson-god-small-things\">Daniel Kitson</a>, have made the anti-TV angle work. “The Daniel Kitson model means having tens of thousands of fans on your mailing list,” says Ward. “If they all give you, say, £10 a year, then you’re in business. Cogs didn’t have that. He lived on a houseboat on the River Avon with his last £20 note. It wasn’t a business plan.”</p> <p>I ask Will whether his father had ambitions for the future and he lets out an almighty laugh. “No, he was fucked!” he says. “He wasn’t getting a lot of gigs. We talked about him living at the end of my mum’s garden.” Tastes had changed. “He never did a Ricky Gervais, claiming he wasn’t ‘allowed’ to say certain things. But he did struggle with the sensitivity of audiences.” His material also played differently once he reached his 50s. “As you get older, you’re less able to style things out,” says Will. “You go from swashbuckling anarchist to bitter old man. I’d sometimes say: ‘Why don’t you try a more cerebral, introspective gig?’ It didn’t come naturally but he gave it a go every now and then. I’d love to have seen more of that.”</p> <p>Though Cognito was often proudly out of step, Ward thinks the landscape had changed irrevocably. “Cogs was the last of a breed. He represented the wild west days. Now you’ve got people writing about comedy gigs on social media like they’re rating kettles on the Argos website.” For Fury, who is keeping the Cognito spirit alive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QB-xrpXBOU\">by touring a show called C*nt!</a>, TV is partly to blame. “Paul was all about being a road comic and not restricting his material just because there might be an exec in the audience. He had something otherworldly about him. The guy died on stage at a comedy night called Lone Wolf – how poetic is that?”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6CDGOb8w7c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M6CDGOb8w7c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>He had joked about his health that night in Bicester, telling the crowd: “Imagine if I died in front of you lot here.” Later, he sat down on stage and fell silent. Cognito had suffered an aortic dissection, a tear to the body’s main artery. As he exhaled for the last time in front of an audience convinced they were watching part of his act, I had wondered if the mythologising of Cognito’s death might have felt disrespectful to his family. (“Died with his boots on,” tweeted Jimmy Carr.) But Will is all for it. “Dad had quit drinking and he was on antidepressants,” he says. “The last time him and my mum saw one another, they went dog-walking and he told her: ‘You know what? I’m really happy.’ His arc did feel complete in a way. He had the rise, the fall, the hardships and then he’d reached this equilibrium. To go out like that, I think, was fitting.”</p> <p>• Ian Cognito: A Life and a Death on Stage is screened at the <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ian-cognito-a-life-and-a-death-on-stage\">Edinburgh fringe</a> from 4 to 14 and 25 to 28 August. <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/c-nt\">Becky Fury: C*nt!</a> is at the Free Fringe, Edinburgh, from 6 to 28 August.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/28/hope-cure-chronic-condition-identity-disability","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"I gave up hope of a cure for my chronic condition.

Sure, I knew it would take longer than recovery from a bog-standard cold, but no more than a few weeks.</p> <p>At first, my optimism seemed warranted. It was the Easter holidays and my parents took good care of me. The fever only lasted a few days and I was out of bed within a week or two. I made it back to university for the summer term; the only difference was that my parents carried my belongings from the car to my room.</p> <p>That was 1993. I was 21 years old.</p> <p>It is now 2022. I am 50 years old. And I still haven’t fully recovered. I have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), the diagnosis you get when you are constantly pursued by exhaustion and doctors have ruled everything else out.</p> <p>In my early to mid-20s, I sort of recovered from the virus and carried on living as I had before: completing a degree, working, returning to postgraduate study, going out drinking with friends, going solo backpacking in Asia. Sounds pretty good on paper, but all those good things were accompanied by the threat or reality of physical collapse. The mix of good days and bad days was bewildering at first until I learned to spot the signs: overexertion, followed a day or two later by a tingle in the throat or my forearms, the overture to days of brain-fogged malaise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/25/tell-us-share-your-stories-of-quitting\">Tell us: share your stories of quitting </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet I have never been too sick to function. I have never been bed-bound or unable to take care of myself. And therein lay my problem: because I was never completely incapacitated, and because of the unpredictability of my condition, there was always hope of recovery.</p> <p>That hope was stoked by my attempts to take control of my health. I got an “official” diagnosis from a “specialist” who could offer me absolutely nothing other than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/04/it-gave-me-an-ability-to-enjoy-life-readers-on-cognitive-behavioural-therapy\">cognitive behavioural therapy</a> (entirely ineffectual in my case). On the recommendation of a friend of a friend I started treatment with a doctor of Chinese medicine. I drank foul-tasting herbal concoctions. I adopted a restricted diet (no gluten or dairy, natch). I stopped smoking and drinking.</p> <p>It kind of worked. I was more stable, more in control. But while I had fewer troughs, I also had fewer peaks. My life lacked joy and I became resentful of the vices that my twentysomething peers could indulge in. The hope of a recovery in the future condemned me to an austere existence in the present; pleasure endlessly deferred.</p> <p>There was no one moment when I decided to give up hope. A lengthy relapse in my early 30s during a time of severe personal and work stress after a long period of reasonable health was part of it. I realised that the only way to avoid such relapses in the future would be to live a life without personal or work commitments; but that simply wasn’t an option for me. A loss of faith in Chinese medicine was certainly a contributor to abandoning hope. While at first it had given me a sense that I was doing something to “fight” my condition, the improvements it brought were marginal beyond that and the medicines were disgusting. Getting married was also a factor; I no longer felt the desperate need to keep up with the socialising of my friends in the hope of finding a girlfriend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"63de29b01097ba9e6dd83a4c6a6f35615d1968a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63de29b01097ba9e6dd83a4c6a6f35615d1968a4/0_71_6936_8670/800.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Kahn-Harris and kids at the Rainbow Los Angeles.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Kahn-Harris and kids at the Rainbow Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Kahn-Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Above all, my condition became familiar to me and, to some extent at least, predictable. I began to forget what it felt like to be “normal”. My condition became an unpleasant but just about tolerable part of life itself.</p> <p>Whatever it was that did it, in my 30s and 40s I gave up hope of a cure, embraced my identity as a person with a disability – and learned how to be happy. I am not on a treadmill of trying new treatments. Maybe one day there will be a cure, or maybe not.</p> <p>Giving up hope has given me back the capacity for joy. I take care to pace myself, but I reserve the right not to. For a few years, I even took up smoking, although I have since quit. As nihilistic as it sounds, I needed to embrace the destruction for a while. I swam throughout one winter in Highgate ponds, enjoying the euphoric glow followed by the inevitable crash.</p> <p>Yet here’s the kicker: hopelessness is a privilege. If my condition was just a bit more severe, my life would be miserable. If I wasn’t married and didn’t have a supportive family, I would be in penury. If I hadn’t chosen a career path that has some flexibility, I would be in a very difficult position.</p> <p>Giving up hope requires a safety net. The challenge for our society is to enable others with chronic conditions and disabilities to give up hope without giving up everything else.</p> <ul> <li><p>Keith Kahn-Harris is a sociologist and author</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/28/blake-ferguson-from-japan-troubles-to-loving-lancashire-life-inside-turbulent-year","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Blake Ferguson: from Japan troubles to loving Lancashire life within turbulent year | Aaron Bower ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/28/blake-ferguson-from-japan-troubles-to-loving-lancashire-life-inside-turbulent-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/28/blake-ferguson-from-japan-troubles-to-loving-lancashire-life-inside-turbulent-year","fields":{"headline":"Blake Ferguson: from Japan troubles to loving Lancashire life inside turbulent year","trailText":"The former NRL player came close to a new career in coal mining before finding an unlikely new lease of life in England’s second division","byline":"Aaron Bower","body":"<p>Blake Ferguson cannot help but burst into laughter when asked if he thought his career would play out this way. The former Kangaroos winger’s rugby league journey has taken a unique and sometimes controversial trajectory but even by those standards, as he adjusts to life as a player in England’s second division – where the majority of the clubs are part-time and some crowds barely reach 1,000 – it is perhaps unsurprising when Ferguson affords himself a moment to reflect on how he has reached this point.</p> <p>“I wouldn’t have thought I’d be here, that’s for sure,” Ferguson admits. After all, it was only this time last year Ferguson was a regular in a Parramatta Eels side that reached the NRL finals, but a lot has happened since then. That includes an ill-fated stint in Japanese rugby union club NEC Green Rockets, which ended with the 32-year-old spending a month in jail in Japan after being arrested for alleged possession of cocaine, before being released.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/26/nrls-pride-jersey-debacle-compounded-by-sports-power-imbalance\">NRL’s pride jersey debacle is compounded by sport’s power imbalance | Megan Maurice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ferguson is loth to discuss the finer points of that saga too much, but after eventually returning to Australia earlier this year and failing to secure an NRL contract, he had, by his own admission, decided he was “semi-retired”. “I wasn’t really bothered about getting a full-time playing contract and I was actually getting ready to start looking for an actual job,” he says. “But then the call came in.. and here we are.”</p> <p>That call Ferguson refers to was from Championship club Leigh Centurions, who made him an offer to return to playing on a short-term contract, nestled away from the Sydney spotlight in a Lancashire town where the population barely exceeds 40,000 people. “I was transitioning into a different part of life and looking forward to it, but the opportunity to keep playing was something I decided to ultimately explore,” he says.</p> <p>“It’s been really refreshing coming here. We’ve a great owner, the coaching staff are fantastic and it’s been so amazing to come here and experience something new and something different with my family, who have come over too. It was important for me to get the right club, and it’s great to get the love back for rugby league.” Ferguson’s impact was immediate, scoring four tries on his debut against Workington Town. He even played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in May as Leigh won the 1895 Cup, a competition reserved exclusively for teams outside of Super League.</p> <p>Yet that is all a far cry from both the life Ferguson experienced at the top of the game in the NRL, and the life he was about to embark on had that call never arrived from Leigh to revive his rugby league career. “I was going to go into the coal mining industry,” the winger laughs. “I had an interview back home about the job before I came over here, around three weeks before in fact so it was getting pretty close.</p> <p>“I’d basically got the job but the chance to come here and keep playing, explore Europe, and get the buzz back for playing the game. It was what I needed. It’s been an absolute breath of fresh air too and I’m really glad I’ve done it. We didn’t get as far as locking down the specific job I was going to be doing in the mines just outside Sydney, but it was definitely going to be different to what I’d been used to.”</p> <p>Ferguson will be the biggest star on show this weekend at the Summer Bash, the equivalent of the NRL’s Magic Weekend, where all teams play in the same stadium on the same weekend. But as he surveys the surroundings in West Yorkshire where he will make his latest appearance as a Leigh player, the question has to be asked: what does the future hold beyond 2022? Leigh are the favourites for promotion to Super League, and the Centurions are keen to keep him and extend their blossoming relationship into a second season with a club and a town that have taken him to their heart.</p> <p>Does playing in Europe’s elite competition entice him? Or has he not yet given up hope of crafting a way back into the NRL? “We’ll see what happens,” he says. “At the moment we’re focussing on footy, my agent does everything for me in that regard and it doesn’t worry me. I came here to enjoy myself and get the buzz back and it’s been exactly that: really enjoyable. Everyone in Lancashire is really nice, you can go out for walks, say hello to people.. it’s been a great change.</p> <p>“All that stuff from my past is behind me now I hope. It’s been good over here to get a fresh start. It’s been a breath of fresh air, seeing different faces and experiencing different things. Let’s enjoy the next 10 weeks with Leigh and worry about the future then.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/27/vasectomy-roe-v-wade-abortion-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Snipped in solidarity: the American men getting vasectomies after Roe – while they can","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/vasectomy-roe-v-wade-abortion-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/vasectomy-roe-v-wade-abortion-supreme-court","fields":{"headline":"Snipped in solidarity: the American men getting vasectomies after Roe – while they can","trailText":"Following the supreme court’s abortion decision, urologists say more men are taking charge of their reproductive health, to permanent ends","byline":"John Semley","body":"<p>Shawn never really wanted children.

The procedure is completed in about half an hour, usually in a doctor’s office. Most men report the only real pain as the initial anesthetic needle to the region. And crucially, vasectomies are now a bit easier to undo – though Shteynshlyuger is quick to note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that men should take the decision to compromise (even semi-permanently) their reproductive abilities lightly. Vasectomy reversal operations are pricey (costing as much as $10,000), with success rates that decrease substantially as time since the vasectomy elapses.</p> <p>Despite practicing in New York, where abortion remains legal, Shteynshlyuger says his calendar has been filling with men coming in from out of state. “I have had some patients express concern to me,” he says. “They live part-time in a state where they may have difficulty accessing abortion services, or their partners may have difficulty accessing abortion services. And that certainly has contributed to the complex decisions that men and their partners make about contraception.”</p> <p>Iain Little, a 40-year-old banker living in Philadelphia, had to call a half-dozen urologists before finally booking his surgery. “It’s been a long process,” he said. Little had always been fairly certain that children weren’t part of his life plan. For years, his wife agreed. Now, recently divorced and dipping his toe back into the dating pool, he felt it was an appropriate time to seriously consider a vasectomy. “Then the Roe thing happened,” Little says. “That cemented it. That was the stars aligning. This needs to be done.” His surgery is booked for this week.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Roe thing cemented it ... this needs to be done</p> <footer> <cite>Iain Little</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Shawn’s reasoning is similarly practical. He worried that broader bans on contraception could follow in the wake of the Dobbs decision. “To be really honest,” he says. “I’m a straight, white dude in America. Typically, I’m the least worried about these things. But they might come for that one. So I was like, ‘I’m just gonna get this done while I still can.’”</p> <p>•••</p> <p>America’s more prominent anti-abortion organizations seem to have no particular objection to vasectomies. The National Right to Life Committee, an establishment anti-abortion group that recently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/national-right-to-life-supreme-court-dobbs-decision/index.html\">celebrated Roe’s downfall at an annual convention</a>, says that the group “takes no position” on the procedure, stopping short of pushing a full-on anti-contraception agenda. “In fact,” NRLC spokesperson Laura Echevarria said in an e-mail, “National Right to Life does not take a stance on anything that prevents fertilization. However, National Right to Life does oppose any device or drug that would destroy a life already created at fertilization.”</p> <p>Other groups are a bit more drastic – in orthodoxy, if not in practice. Theresa Notare, of the secretariat of laity, marriage, family life and youth for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, helps clarify the Church’s official position. “Direct sterilization? That would be a major problem. Mortal sin. It’s in the books.”</p> <p>The Conference of Catholic Bishops has long served as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120399270\">a powerful anti-abortion lobby</a>. In 1973, James T McHugh, a prominent priest and former director of the NRLC, proclaimed: “The only reason that we have a pro-life movement in this country is because of the Catholic people and the Catholic church.” Nevertheless, Notare rebuffs ideas that the Catholic church is gunning for contraception (or sterilization) next, “mortal sin” or no. “To my knowledge, there is no plan,” she says. “There doesn’t seem to be any necessity to do that.”</p> <p>In the current climate, a vasectomy almost seems like a political gesture. It’s a way for men to take a more active stake in big decisions about contraception and reproduction that typically fall to women.</p> <p>As Shawn and his fiancee were mulling more permanent options for contraception, he began to notice an obvious disjoint between the care he was offered and that which women are typically afforded. He has heard stories of women seeking tubal ligation (colloquially, “tube-tying”) procedures who are pressed about the considerations of “the hypothetical man” – husbands, or even prospective husbands, who may take issue with the procedure. “I see women talking about how they need their husbands’ signatures,” he said, shaking his head, a little disbelieving. “My fiancee was there for my vasectomy. No one asked her. There’s a huge double standard with reproductive rights.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/25/us-abortion-bans-states-after-roe-v-wade\">The dystopian American reality one month after the Roe v Wade reversal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Suddenly, with the upsetting of Roe, the cultural response to a “child-free” lifestyle has itself been overturned. Once regarded as a selfish gesture, sterilization can now seem downright altruistic. Little has certainly entertained these sorts of bigger political and social considerations. But he ultimately sees them more as post-hoc justifications for something he was already considering. “It sounds grandiose to say that it’s a show of solidarity,” he says. “I don’t want to get a girl pregnant, right? Abortion was never the first choice, obviously. But it was a choice.”</p> <p>Now, those choices are being reduced. Republicans in Little’s home state of Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-house-senate-constitutional-amendment-abortion-gop/\">have advanced legislation</a> to restrict abortion access – efforts the Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, has vowed to veto. Such promises seem only modestly encouraging nowadays. If there was a lesson to be learned in the reversal of Roe, it’s that one should never say never.</p> <p>Indeed, Shawn’s thinking on the subject can trend towards openly despairing. His vasectomy was more than just a way of chipping in. The rolling back of abortion rights has served to strengthen his – and his fiancee’s – conviction that procreating at all in the modern US is vaguely immoral. He mentions the ballooning costs of raising a child, the increase in climate disasters, and even the supreme court’s reversal of Roe v Wade<em> </em>itself. “Even if I wanted children,” he says, “there’s lots of reasons not to bring a kid into the world right now.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/game-of-thrones-v-lord-of-the-rings-who-will-win-in-the-battle-of-the-spin-offs","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Game of Thrones v Lord of the Rings: who will win the epic battle of the spin-offs?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/game-of-thrones-v-lord-of-the-rings-who-will-win-in-the-battle-of-the-spin-offs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/game-of-thrones-v-lord-of-the-rings-who-will-win-in-the-battle-of-the-spin-offs","fields":{"headline":"Game of Thrones v Lord of the Rings: who will win the epic battle of the spin-offs?","trailText":"Hundreds of millions of dollars have been flung into making prequels of the fantasy franchises. But which will triumph? Or, with no familiar characters, could both end in disaster?","byline":"Steve Rose","body":"<p>‘We thought the war, at last, was ended,” says Morfydd Clark’s elf queen Galadriel in the trailer for Amazon’s new Lord of the Rings series, but she really ought to know better. High fantasy thrives on tales of epic battle, but this autumn a different kind of showdown is taking shape. Rather than good v evil or elves v orcs, a clash of eye-wateringly expensive streaming series is on the cards, the likes of which we have never seen before.</p> <p>At one end of the field is Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, Amazon’s lavish, long-awaited prequel to JRR Tolkien’s hugely successful fantasy saga. At the other is House of the Dragon, HBO’s lavish, long-awaited prequel to George RR Martin’s hugely successful fantasy saga. In what appears to be a deliberate head-to-head, the 10-part House of the Dragon will debut on 21 August, two weeks before the eight-part The Rings of Power launches, which means the two series will reach their respective climaxes the same week. Who will be the victor? Do we have room for both? Or, in fact, either? And who has the most to lose?</p> <p>At this stage, the final question is the easiest to answer. The most talked-about aspect of The Rings of Power so far has been its budget. It is by all accounts the most expensive show ever made. Amazon has spent more than $1bn (£820m) on it, including an estimated $462m for the first season alone. That works out at nearly $60m an episode. House of the Dragon looks frugal by comparison: an estimated $20m an episode. This is still at the upper end, though: the final seasons of Game of Thrones came in at about $15m an episode, Disney’s Marvel and Star Wars miniseries have cost between $15m and $25m an episode, and Peter Jackson’s original Lord of the Rings trilogy cost less than $100m a movie.</p> <p>For most networks, Rings of Power would be betting the farm, but whereas rivals such as HBO, Disney and Netflix live and die by the success of their content, Amazon is primarily a retail business, with almost bottomless reserves of cash.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DotnJ7tTA34\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DotnJ7tTA34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Money is no object for Amazon, but prestige and intellectual property are, says Julia Alexander, the director of strategy at Parrot Analytics. “What Amazon is trying to do is what many of these companies are trying to do – which is develop the next big franchise that they can then spin off into films and merchandising and games and really create a flywheel effect. So to that extent, The Rings of Power is a very, very important move. It’s Amazon coming into the fold and saying: ‘We can compete with the Marvel and Star Wars, and the Harry Potters. We’re willing to spend that money.’”</p> <p>It was Amazon’s deep pockets and desire for its own franchise properties (along with Jeff Bezos’s personal love of Tolkien, reportedly) that saw it outbid rivals (including HBO and Netflix) <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/how-lord-rings-tv-series-landed-at-amazon-not-netflix-1099213/\">to secure the rights to Tolkien’s Middle-earth mythology for $250m in 2017</a>. However, these rights only cover the “second age” of Middle-earth lore – a period centuries before the “third age” in which the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings stories take place. As a result, Rings of Power cannot incorporate familiar characters such as Gandalf or Bilbo Baggins. There are a few exceptions – Clark plays a younger version of the elf queen Galadriel, who was played by Cate Blanchett in Jackson’s trilogy – but the second age was only vaguely sketched out by Tolkien in a 150-page postscript to The Lord of the Rings, known as the Appendices, so Amazon is in effect starting from scratch. The challenge, as co-showrunner Patrick McKay put it, was: “Can we come up with the novel Tolkien never wrote and do it as the mega-event series that could only happen now?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/20/house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones-hbo\">House of the Dragon: what can we expect from the Game of Thrones prequel?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Coincidentally, House of the Dragon faces a similar predicament. Like Rings of Power, it is a prequel. It is adapted from Martin’s 2018 book Fire and Blood, which is set 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones. So again, it will not include any familiar characters or storylines. Instead, House of the Dragon focuses on the Shakespearean succession battles of the house Targaryen, led by Matt Smith, Paddy Considine, Olivia Cooke and newcomer Emma D’Arcy.</p> <p>Despite the rivalry, crossover between these two franchises runs deep. Martin admits his fiction was heavily influenced by Tolkien. “I yield to no one in my admiration for The Lord of the Rings,” <a href=\"https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/08/george-r-r-martin-i-revere-the-lord-of-the-rings/\">he told the Edinburgh international book festival</a> in 2014. “I reread it every few years. It’s one of the great books of the 20th century.” Martin’s fantasy arguably embraces more moral and political complexity than Tolkien’s (and, of course, more sex and violence), but is set in a similar quasi-medieval realm of swords, sorcery, fantastical beasts and strange names.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYnQDsaxHZU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYnQDsaxHZU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It was the success of Jackson’s Lord of the Rings movies that convinced HBO there was a market for a grownup fantasy series. So their ears pricked up when, in 2006, screenwriters David Benioff and DB Weiss pitched their adaptation of Martin’s books as “Sopranos in Middle-earth”. The pendulum has now swung the other way: the stellar success of Game of Thrones has had rival streamers seeking more of the same. In 2017, the Amazon Studios chief, Roy Price, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/amazon-studios-jeff-bezos-roy-price-zelda-1202552532/\">told Variety his orders from Jeff Bezos</a> were effectively, “Bring me a Game of Thrones.” Amazon has already had one stab at a high-fantasy franchise: last year’s Wheel of Time, adapted from Robert Jordan’s novels (for a mere $10m an episode), and led by Rosamund Pike. It is being renewed for a second series, but so far has not quite crossed over into the mainstream.</p> <p>Amazon is starting from scratch production-wise as well as story-wise, which partly explains the show’s colossal budget. Unlike House of the Dragon, which can refer to a decade of world-building experience from Game of Thrones, Rings of Power has had a whole new fantasy world to establish: costumes, props, characters, sets, locations, the look and feel of the show, teaching actors to speak Elvish, and so forth – knowing that superfans will pore over every detail looking for errors.</p> <p>Rings of Power is expected to run for at least five seasons, so many of these are one-off costs, but the series has been beset by other issues. Filming began in New Zealand in February 2020 but shortly after, the Covid pandemic shut down production for several months. New Zealand’s strict quarantining rules stranded <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/coronavirus-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-production-in-west-auckland-shut-down/JZE3ZEXWQQIQJXH4KYENFR3LRY/?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12316871\">800 cast and crew members there</a>, and prevented outside visitors coming in. They muddled through, but a year ago, Amazon announced it was relocating the entire operation to the UK. Season two is already in production at Bray Studios in Berkshire. “What that tells me is ‘car crash’,” says one industry insider, who estimates the cost of such a move alone as $30m. “You don’t move like that unless it’s not going well.” As well as the dismantling and reconstruction of sets and the like, such moves often entail expensive reshoots and money wasted on unusable footage, they suggest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dcda057b83f447da98c34c64e54b78de3768740\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dcda057b83f447da98c34c64e54b78de3768740/0_0_5975_3134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eve Best and Steve Toussaint in House of the Dragon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"525\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eve Best and Steve Toussaint in House of the Dragon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also question marks over Rings of Power’s relatively inexperienced showrunners: McKay and JD Payne, whose only credit to date is co-writing 2016’s Star Trek Beyond (Star Trek producer JJ Abrams apparently recommended them to Amazon). “The pressure to succeed for Amazon is enormous,” the insider continues, “but with projects of this scale, there can end up being too many voices in the room, drowning out the creatives. Things start to eat themselves at that stage.”</p> <p>HBO has a reputation for being more experienced, more in tune with its creatives, and less profligate, but it has also had its challenges. For one thing, Game of Thrones didn’t exactly go out on a high. Many fans complained the grand finale was disappointingly rushed and clumsily written, to the extent that 1 million of them signed a petition demanding the final season be remade. To make matters worse, Benioff and Weiss parted ways with HBO, signing a $200m deal with Netflix in 2019.<br><br>Like its rivals, the network has been desperately seeking “the next Game of Thrones”. In 2018, HBO put five different Game of Thrones spin-offs into development, with five different showrunners, almost like a tournament. The winner was a script known as Bloodmoon, run by Jane Goldman, the writer of the Kick-Ass and Kingsman franchises. The network spent an estimated $30m shooting a pilot, led by Naomi Watts, but according to reports HBO was “not thrilled by the results”, and abruptly pulled the plug on the show. They then switched horses to House of the Dragon with showrunners Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik, the latter of whom directed several Game of Thrones episodes.</p> <p>Such headaches are par for the course with this scale of production, and are by no means indicative of the final result. In fact, HBO abandoned its first attempt at Game of Thrones. Again, they were “not thrilled” by the pilot, so went back to the drawing board and spent nine months redeveloping the show to make it more realistic. The strategy paid off.</p> <p>But above this mega-budget fantasy fray hangs a broader question: why should we watch either of these shows? Given today’s diverse, progressive, global audience, might these high-fantasy sagas seem a little archaic? Both are essentially reimaginings of feudal, patriarchal, medieval Europe, created by white, middle-aged men in the 20th century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/20/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-race\">‘The history of fantasy is racialized’: Lord of the Rings series sparks debate over race</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As if to acknowledge this fact, both shows are making concerted efforts to modernise their material. In both Tolkein’s fiction and Jackson’s adaptations, Middle-earth was an almost entirely white realm. Different mythical races existed, such as elves, dwarves and hobbits, but not humans of colour. Rings of Power attempts to mix it up racially. For the first time, we see elves, dwarves and “harfoots” – ancient ancestors of hobbits – being played by actors of colour, including Lenny Henry. Inevitably, there has been a backlash from some corners of Tolkien fanbase.</p> <p>Game of Thrones attracted similar criticism for its lack of actors of colour in leading roles (not to mention Emilia Clarke’s Daenerys Targaryen, who was presented as a pale, white-haired “white saviour” amid the darker-skinned Dothraki people). House of the Dragon makes some amends by casting Steve Toussaint as Lord Corlys Velaryon, a central character who was white in Martin’s source novel.</p> <p>In terms of female representation, too, both franchises have made changes. Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit were overwhelmingly male-dominated affairs, but Rings of Power promises a more equitable mix. And while Game of Thrones featured multiple female protagonists, many found its casual approach to sexual violence objectionable. It is rumoured that House of the Dragon will slightly tone down the sexual content and focus on the brutal treatment of women, including the violent nature of childbirth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64861113607afb19a80cb684fbcd4237fa1a60c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64861113607afb19a80cb684fbcd4237fa1a60c6/0_0_5000_3332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon Prime Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But perhaps it is a mistake to see the two shows as direct competitors at all. Unlike when rival movies or network television programmes have gone up against each other in the past, streaming is less of a zero-sum game. Fans do not necessarily have to pick a side. Simply measuring which programme had the most viewers is “an antiquated way of looking at it”, says Alexander. “Because the bigger questions are: how many subscribers did it bring? How many subscribers did it stop from leaving? How many of those customers are engaging with the platform elsewhere? Of course, viewership is still a huge part of it, but it is so beyond just the one-to-one relationship.” From Alexander’s research there is no clear frontrunner. “There is an insane amount of anticipation and demand for these two shows.”</p> <p>It may be more enlightened not to view this as “one franchise to rule them all” competition, but the fantasy genre is not exactly renowned for its love of peaceful, diplomatic resolution. It thrives on conflict. Martin, for one, has welcomed the head-to-head, even as he bemoaned the perceived rivalry. “I hope both shows succeed,” <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/george-rr-martin-lord-of-the-rings-b2089381.html\">he said in a recent interview</a>, before adding: “I hope we succeed more.

Though no drastic measures were agreed at the meeting, hosepipe bans are under consideration. Farmers may have to restrict irrigation in some areas and water companies are bracing for high demand and low rainfall.</p> \n<p>Wouter Buytaert, professor of hydrology and water resources at Imperial College London, said: “We experience drought in the UK when the water stored in our rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater runs exceptionally low. The south-east of the UK is particularly vulnerable, not only because it receives the least rainfall, but it also has the highest demand.”</p> \n<p>He said people could make a big difference to the availability of water by reducing their use, but in the longer term the government must act. “We should focus on the reduction of leakage, better use of rainwater in buildings, and water reuse in industrial processes.”</p> \n<p>This year’s extremes follow a relatively moderate year in 2021, when winter and spring were “near-normal” in temperature compared with the long-term average, but summer and autumn showed a clear global heating trend, warmer by 1.5C and 1.8C respectively than the benchmark average of 1961-1990.</p> \n<p>The maximum temperature recorded in the UK in 2021 was 32.2C, well below last week’s peaks but still markedly above the 31.4C average hottest day per year in the benchmark 1961-1990 period.</p> \n<p>Overall, last year was the 18th warmest year on record, based on the UK’s comprehensive temperature series dating back to 1884. But 2021 also saw significant storms and weather damage, including the destructive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/01/storm-arwen-uk-must-prepare-for-more-extreme-weather\">Storm Arwen that hit last November</a> – which would have been far more damaging had it not occurred at neap tide, when waters are low – as well as Storm Darcy in February, and heavy rain last October.</p> \n<p>Mike Kendon, of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said last year’s weather had been highly variable, as laid out in the <a href=\"https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/JOC.7787\">State of the UK Climate report published on Thursday</a>. “It is telling that whereas we consider 2021 as near-average for temperature in the context of the current climate, had this occurred just over three decades ago it would have been one of the UK’s warmest years on record,” he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Unusually, last April was colder than March, which has only happened 15 times in the central England temperature record, which goes back 363 years. This led to a “split spring”, when a warm March helped to bring earlier trees into leaf sooner, but those that would be expected to leaf in April were delayed by the cold. Experts said this probably had an impact on other species, as insects would have been less available for birds in the crucial spring nesting season.</p> \n<p>The rate of sea level rise around the UK has also accelerated, from about 1.5mm a year over a century ago to about 3mm to 5.2mm a year at present, varying by location around the UK.

As recently as 2008, more than 50% of UK staff worked abroad. Local staff do not have diplomatic immunity, the same security clearance or working hours.</p> <p>The report adds that staff morale needs urgent protection by creating a culture in which complaints can be raised without fear of reprisals and with confidence concerns will be acted on.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “Staff across our organisation are working together to promote and defend the UK overseas, deal with crises and fight global challenges.</p> <p>“We led the international response to the war in Ukraine, introducing the largest and most severe package of sanctions ever

He said he told Barilaro that “these processes will be done at arm’s length of government … and he was free to apply for a job like any other private citizen”.</p> <p>He also confirmed he had given Brown a “heads up” that Barilaro might apply for the position.</p> <p>However, he insisted he had not encouraged or discouraged Barilaro from applying.</p> <p>“Absolutely not,” he said at the time. “I merely provided him information that the role would be advertised publicly and he would have the opportunity to enter that recruitment process like any other person,” he said.</p> <p>The Guardian has contacted Ayres’ office for comment.</p> <p>Barilaro has since withdrawn from the position, citing the intense media attention his appointment had garnered, but has said he “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/30/john-barilaro-withdraws-from-new-york-trade-role-due-to-media-attention\">always maintained that I followed the process</a>”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/28/country-diary-we-cannot-take-picturesque-views-at-face-value-any-more","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T04:30:37Z","webTitle":"Country diary: We cannot take picturesque views at face value any more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/28/country-diary-we-cannot-take-picturesque-views-at-face-value-any-more","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/28/country-diary-we-cannot-take-picturesque-views-at-face-value-any-more","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: We cannot take picturesque views at face value any more","trailText":"<strong>The Marches, Shropshire:</strong> Heatwaves that last only days do permanent damage to plants","byline":"Paul Evans","body":"<p>Thistles stand against the western view from the top of Lyth Hill.

Outbreaks since then have mostly been detected in eastern and southern Africa.</p> <h2><strong>What are the symptoms?</strong></h2> <p>At its early stages, after an incubation period between two and 21 days, patients can present with headache, muscle aches, fever, and chills. The virus can then cause haemorrhaging, organ failure, weight loss, jaundice, delirium and pancreas inflammation, according to the WHO. Fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple parts of the body.</p> <p>Given early symptoms are similar to many other tropical febrile diseases such as Ebola, malaria, and typhoid, the WHO says it can be difficult to identify.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">average fatality rate for MVD</a> is 50%. At its lowest, the fatality rate was 24% during the first recorded outbreak in Germany. However, the fatality rate reached 88% in Angola during a 2005 outbreak, resulting in 329 deaths.</p> <p>According to Prof Oyewale Tomori, the president of the Nigerian academy of science and a virology expert, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-marburg-virus-urgent-need-to-contain-this-close-cousin-of-ebola-187542\">there is a “great deal” we don’t yet know</a> about MVD. This includes whether infection can be caused by contact with bat droppings in caves.</p> <h2><strong>What is the treatment for the virus?</strong></h2> <p>There are no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments to treat MVD, according to the WHO. However, patients have a chance of survival if specific symptoms are treated, and if supportive care is provided such as rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids.</p> <p>A range of treatments are being evaluated, including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies.</p> <h2><strong>Where has it been detected?</strong></h2> <p>No cases of MVD have been detected outside Africa in the latest outbreak. The <strong>three</strong> people who died from the disease had been in Ghana’s Ashanti region, the most populated part of the country.</p> <p>The first two cases were not found to be epidemiologically linked, however the latest two people infected by the virus are close contacts of the index cases, according to the Ghana’s ministry of health. Extensive field investigation is underway to determine if the virus has spread further.</p> <p>“This is a problem, it only takes one case and then it balloons,” Tomori told The Guardian. “It was in Guinea last year, it is in Ghana this year, it could be anywhere.”</p> <p>Tomori believes MVD has long been endemic in many parts of Africa, but because of a lack of resources to detect the virus it has gone unnoticed.</p> <h2><strong>What steps have been taken to contain the outbreak?</strong></h2> <p>Ghana’s ministry of health is <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/ghana-declares-first-outbreak-of-highly-infectious-marburg-virus\">coordinating a response with aid agencies</a>, including enhancing surveillance for the virus and epidemiological investigations.

The high volume of internet traffic, says 22-year-old Ukraine rapper Jockii Druce, led to his satirical song about Russia’s invasion becoming wildly popular.</p> <p>Thousands of TikTok videos have been created in Ukraine using Jockii Druce’s music, racking up millions of plays.</p> <p>His most <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFIeP6xb0oE\">viral song</a>, entitled What Are You Brothers?, addresses Ukrainians but is an obvious play on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s, assertion that Ukraine and Russia are “brotherly nations”.</p> <p>The song, released in early March, vents anger at Russia through its satirical lyrics, telling Ukrainians to let go of the idea that they can convince their “brothers” across the border to stop their invasion. Like an estimated one in four Ukrainians, Jockii Druce has relatives, albeit distant, in Russia.</p> <p>The song ends by listing the historical and recent tragedies that Ukrainians have survived – serfdom, genocide, revolutions, coronavirus – and poses the rhetorical question of whether they should weep because of the full-scale invasion, followed by the final line: “No way – Russian warship go fuck yourself”, which has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/ukrainian-soldier-russian-warship-medal-snake-island\">a rallying cry</a> of Ukrainian resistance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFIeP6xb0oE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jFIeP6xb0oE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Jockii Druce’s viral song What Are You Brothers?

But the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/20/ukraine-restricts-russian-books-and-music-in-latest-step-of-derussification\">rejection of Russian culture</a> in Ukraine has led Russian cultural figures to argue that Russian culture is being cancelled and its role misunderstood.</p> <p>Jockii Druce is not the only Ukrainian artist to gain popularity after creating a song about the invasion. However, he is one of the few to do so with nuanced and stirring irony – a talent that makes his music stand apart from the mainstream and has made him popular among younger Ukrainians.</p> <p>“I’m not really an emotional person. [My work] is mostly about understanding different contexts and things people tend to manipulate,” said Jockii Druce, at a cafe in downtown Kyiv, wearing a monochrome Adidas tracksuit.</p> <p>“When you realise what they think about us, that we’re some filthy fucking pigs that are just quick to riot and storm [buildings], and you just started to be ironic about it,” he said, in a reference to the lyrics of another of his songs, We’re Going to Have Breakfast.</p> <p>For Jockii Druce, there is no point in trying to change Russians’ minds, because their state propaganda machine is too strong. “You could send them a photo of dead children in Bucha or anything,” he said of the site of an infamous Russian massacre. “And they’re going to make 100 million fucking photos or get people to say that [Ukraine] did it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/27/alexei-ratmansky-russian-cultural-figures-must-oppose-war-in-ukraine\">Alexei Ratmansky: Russian cultural figures must oppose war in Ukraine </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jockii Druce, who grew up in the south-central city of Dnipro, said he grew up as a Russian-speaking Ukrainian and started rapping with his friends after school for fun.

No. But to say that they are talentless or they are bad because of the war would just be hypocritical.

The Treasury trimmed its estimate of global expansion by half a percentage point to 3.25% for 2022 and 2023.</p> \n<p>Chalmers also noted that the International Monetary Fund now expects global inflation to reach 8.3% by the end of this year, driven by higher food and energy prices, and strained supply chains.</p> \n<p>He said the headline inflation rate would return to the 2% to 3% target range used by the Reserve Bank by the middle of 2024.

Prescription costs will also be cut by as much as $12.50 a script.</p> \n<p>Training would also help lift opportunities for people to secure higher wages, Chalmers said, as would government investments in new industries.</p> \n<p>A third leg would be efforts to “unclog and untangle our supply chains” to help quell inflation.

Enshrining the target into law will help “end the climate wars”, Albanese has promised.</p> <p>But choosing to repeat a pro-coal talking point that’s been fired like a missile during those wars seems at odds with that promise.</p> <p>“It’s a meme and it’s disappointing and disturbing that the Albanese government has picked this up,” says Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics.</p> <p>“It’s an argument that’s been pushed by the coal industry for as long as I can remember. When it comes down to CO2 emissions it has never had much credibility.”</p> <p>But is there any truth to the claim?</p> <p>“No. It’s an old myth,” Hare says. “The savings would be very small and if there was data it would be difficult to measure.”</p> <p>The Minerals Council of Australia says the average energy content of coal exported from Australia is among the highest of competing international suppliers, and has less sulphur. Higher energy content generally means less CO2 emissions when it’s burned in a power station.</p> <p>But in a report on the properties of exported thermal coal, the minerals council also says emissions “vary with both the technology used and the coal properties”. While CO2 emissions can be calculated, the report says the data “is unavailable for all the international coals reviewed in this paper”.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://whitehavencoal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Whitehaven_Coal_Sustainability_Report_2021.pdf\">a report from Whitehaven Coal</a>, which says the company exports “high-quality coal”, the difference in burning its coal in a power station compared to burning coal from Korea or China is about 4%.</p> <p>What’s rarely discussed is that emissions from coal exports don’t only occur in the country where the coal is burned. Building new mines and expanding old ones will also see methane emissions rise.</p> <p>Analysts have warned Australia’s coal mines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/greenhouse-emissions-from-australias-coalmines-could-be-twice-as-high-as-official-figures-say\">could be leaking twice as much methane</a> as is reported. Emissions of that potent greenhouse gas are not considered when the industry’s promoters talk about CO2 emissions from burning coal.</p> <p>But finding theoretical “savings” in emissions from promoting the “qualities” of Australian coal sent overseas is just fiddling in the margins, if those savings even occur.</p> <p>If the world is to reach its climate goals, the solution is not to substitute one lump of coal for another, but to burn much less of the stuff in the first place.</p> <p>Hare says continuing to justify global supply of coal at scale will only keep prices for the commodity low in the long term, slowing the transition to renewable energy.</p> <p>“By putting more coal on the market, we block ourselves from the opportunities in the transition to green energy.”</p> <h2>Carbon neutral petrol?</h2> <p>Ampol, the filling station formerly known as Caltex, <a href=\"https://www.ampol.com.au/business-services/carbon-neutral-fuel\">has announced</a> it is now offering “carbon neutral” petrol and diesel to business customers.</p> <p>The climate crisis is largely a creation of fossil fuels, so to claim that burning some of them in a vehicle can be “carbon neutral” has a very oxymoronic feel to it.</p> <p>Ampol has already bought and retired as many carbon offsets as it thinks it will need (84,317 tonnes of CO2 equivalent) to cover the “sourcing, refining, distribution, retailing and consumption” of the fuels.</p> <p>Less than half the offsets are Australian projects, with the rest including reforestation in China, landfill gas in Turkey and a coastal conservation project in Guatemala.</p> <p>But there’s a general rule in decarbonisation that offsets are only used to cut your emissions as a last resort. So if you were a company worried about your transport emissions, you would take all other steps first, such as switching to electric vehicles, before buying offsets.</p> <p>So is this an appropriate use of offsets?</p> <p>“In a word, no,” says Polly Hemming, an advisor on climate and energy thinktank the Australia Institute.</p> <p>“Ampol is a case study in the way carbon offsets are being used to delay decarbonisation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/20/greens-want-to-improve-and-pass-climate-bill-but-remain-critical-of-43-target\">Greens want to ‘improve and pass’ Labor’s climate bill but remain critical of 43% target</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Offsets don’t reduce emissions.

Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,” the Fed said.</p> <p>The central bank added that Russia’s war against Ukraine is “causing tremendous human and economic hardship” as well as “additional upward pressure on inflation” and weighing on global economic activity.</p> <p>The US central bank is aggressively raising rates at levels unseen since the mid-1990s as it struggles to tamp down soaring prices, which rose by an annual rate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/13/high-us-gas-food-prices-june-led-to-largest-annual-increase-inflation-40-years\">9.1% in June</a>, the fastest inflation rate since 1981.</p> <p>The hike raises the Fed’s cost of borrowing to between 2.25% and 2.5% and is the Fed’s fourth rate increase this year. It comes as central banks worldwide seek to calm price rises with higher rates. Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated that there would be more outsized increases ahead if inflation is not brought under control.</p> <p>Powell said he did not believe the US was currently in a recession but that the Fed needed to slow growth in order to control inflation.</p> <p>“We are not trying to have a recession and we don’t think we have to,” said Powell. “We think there’s a path for us to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market.” But he said he expected the jobs market to soften in reaction to the Fed’s moves and that it was essential for inflation to be tamed. “Price stability is what makes the whole economy work,” said Powell.</p> <p>However, Wall Street stocks lifted sharply after Powell’s statement was seen by some investors as easing concerns that even higher rate hikes could follow this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped more than 4% and the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index was up 3.9% as both registered their biggest one-day percentage gains since April 2020. </p> <p>So far the rate rises appear to have done little to rein in rising prices and the costs of everything from food and rent to gas remain high. The Fed will not meet again until September, at which point more economic data will be available, and its decision committee should be better able to see if its policy is working.</p> <p>One important measure of the economy will be made public on Thursday, when the commerce department releases its latest survey of gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of the cost of a wide range of goods and services across the US economy. Many economists are expecting growth to have slowed for the second quarter in a row – a guide used by many to declare a recession.</p> <p>Recessions are, however, officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a research group that uses a broad range of measures including jobs growth to decide when the US economy is shrinking. The NBER often makes its announcement well after a recession has begun, as it assesses other economic factors.</p> <p>Jobs growth remains strong – the US added 372,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate stayed low at 3.6%.</p> <p>But, for many, two months of declining GDP is a strong indicator that the economy is in a recession.

These systems took that chance away from him.</p> <p>Even the small bit of contact we could share as a family was taken away from us by Corrective Services NSW.

Coroner Grahame also found that Kevin being denied parole for nearly 20 years “intertwined” with his solvent use issues, and the solvent issues only worsened the cardiac problems.</p> <p>He didn’t get the help he deserved in prison – spiritual help, help with his physical or mental health. We had built a support network on the outside ready to help him. Durri Aboriginal Medical Service had a drug and alcohol doctor ready to support him. We could have cared for him like they never did.</p> <p>Things would have been so different.</p> <p>He told me that he wanted to help kids who went through similar things, who were taken away and who have been incarcerated. Kevin could have helped steer them on the right path. He could have broken this brainless, infinite cycle. He could have told them that they deserved better, just like he did.

After all – aside from politely taking up minimal space in the freezer – at less than $2 for 250 grams, frozen spinach is around one-fifth the cost of fresh baby spinach. It’s also incredibly accommodating, adapting to just about any cuisine, from gently spiced saag dals to crunchy-topped, buttery spanakopita. And it’s super quick to cook.</p> <p>“If you are adding it to soups, stews and curries, or anything ‘wet’, then defrosting isn’t necessary,” says the chef of Penrith’s Cafe Royce and author of Australia: The Cookbook, Ross Dobson.</p> <p>“However, because frozen spinach contains a lot of water, if you’re adding to anything that needs baking, then defrosting is best. Simply put the spinach in a colander and let it defrost at room temperature,” he says. “Then squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible before using.”</p> <h2>Simmered on the stove</h2> <p>Spinach is perfect for adding a pop of colour to soup. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/14/spinach-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall\">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</a> adds fresh spinach at the end of his spinach and lentil soup, along with tomatoes, carrots and shallots, but you could easily swap fresh for frozen if you give it a few more minutes.</p> <p>Hangry? You can whip up Dobson’s cream of spinach soup in the time it takes to toast some bread. “Cook frozen spinach, vegetable stock and a pinch of grated nutmeg until the spinach has completely dissolved,” says Dobson. Then, “stir through cream and serve with buttered toast”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e41c6b1173e961f5e712be418bb9c4579e8933dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e41c6b1173e961f5e712be418bb9c4579e8933dc/0_543_2126_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A five-minute lentil dal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hunt’s five-minute lentil dal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hunt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dal is also a perfect dance partner to spinach, says Bhavna Kalra of <a href=\"https://www.themoderndesi.co/\">the Modern Desi</a>, who runs Indian cooking classes in Sydney.

While many home cooks wound up finding that project high on mess and low on flavour, Dobson has an incredibly easy but impressive-looking alternative, with absolute minimal kitchen skills required.</p> <p>“Whip up some defrosted frozen spinach with ricotta, grated parmesan and egg until thick and creamy. Stir through some plain flour until dough-like. Roll into walnut-sized balls and cook in boiling water until they rise to the top. These ‘naked’ ravioli can then be served with a simple Napoletana-style tomato sauce and grated parmesan.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/22/cook-jamie-oliver-rose-gray-river-cafe-recipe-rotolo\">Jamie Oliver</a> credits a spinach and butternut pumpkin pasta dish, learned early in his career, with “changing his life.” It was what he was cooking while the River Café documentary was filming and he was “discovered” as a result. All it takes are some premade lasagne sheets (about $4 in supermarkets) rolled around a filling of butternut pumpkin, spinach and feta, then cut into loose, upstanding squat “cannelloni”, cooked in a simple sauce of jarred passata.</p> <h2>Baked into pie</h2> <p>One of spinach’s greatest starring roles is the Greek classic spanakopita, where its slight tannic bitterness and soft texture is the perfect juxtaposition to salty, creamy feta and explosive, buttery pastry.</p> <p>“Defrost the frozen spinach, then drain,” says Eleftheria Amanatidis of Melbourne’s Eleni’s Kitchen and Bar.</p> <p>“Sauté chopped onion with olive oil and butter until translucent,” she elaborates. “Add salt and pepper and mix in the spinach. We make the pastry ourselves, but you can use bought filo pastry (about $4 in supermarkets).</p> <p>“Layer each pastry sheet with melted butter (approximately two-thirds of the pastry packet). Spread across the spanakopita mix and crumble feta over the top. Add the top layers, buttering each one and tuck in the edges. Brush with plenty of melted butter and cook for 35-40 minutes, to be really crisp.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d13a56781c81c18653f057b5a9d4b8e344f966a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d13a56781c81c18653f057b5a9d4b8e344f966a/0_0_3573_2954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s spanakopita.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"827\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s spanakopita.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/aug/22/how-to-cook-the-perfect-spanakopita-greek-spinach-feta-pie\">Felicity Cloake</a> passes on the tip of using olive oil instead of butter and “drizzling” rather than brushing, so the sheets don’t stick together and air pockets are created – which makes for a crunchier end result.

campaign in 2014, as he necessarily would have been as party leader”.</p> <p>“However, there was no evidence he was aware of what I described in my report as the artifice: the manner in which Mr Lenders had proposed the field organisers would divide their activities and be paid in a split fashion by both the ALP and parliament,” she wrote.</p> <p>Glass said “other than unsupported claims made by Mr Somyurek”, there was no new evidence indicating the premier’s involvement in the scheme since her 2018 report.</p> <p>“It is time to end this debate,” she wrote. “I cannot, of course, rule out that further evidence may yet come to light, but with the passage of time and difficulty in proof I am not prepared to spend further public resources on these matters.”</p> <p>Andrews on Thursday said he was “focused on the future” and would let the ombudsman’s report speak for itself.</p> <p>“These matters have been well canvassed,” he told reporters.</p> <p>But the opposition has seized on the report and Andrews’ comments backing Lenders as a person of the “highest integrity”.</p> <p>“When it comes to Daniel Andrews it’s always someone else’s fault, he’s in charge but never held to account,” opposition government scrutiny spokesperson Louise Staley said in a statement.</p> <p>“Instead of acting to clean up his grubby party, Daniel Andrews continues to defend and promote the mastermind behind a $388,000 theft of taxpayers money.”</p> <p>Glass noted Somyurek had “changed his version of events” between his appearance before Ibac and his 2022 speech at parliament and he would not hand over emails he said supported his claims.</p> <p>The report also reveals Somyurek refused to provide the evidence he gave publicly to police when he was contacted by a detective in November 2021.</p> <p>“It would be a breach of the parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech for me to question Mr Somyurek’s motives or credibility,” Glass wrote.</p> <p>“I refrain from comment and allow the evidence, presented in its entirety, to speak for itself.”</p> <p>Glass said while her jurisdiction does not extend to Victoria police, she believed their 2018 operation, including the dawn arrests, “was a mistake”.</p> <p>“That these issues continue to loom large in the public consciousness as an example of unpunished wrongdoing is a product of many factors, including the police operation in 2018,” she said.</p> <p>“But it is also a product of the unsatisfactory state of the law in relation to the misuse of public funds, and an inadequate system for investigating and sanctioning MPs who break the rules.”</p> <p>Glass said it was “a pity” senior members of Victoria police did not intervene to stop the arrests and suggested they apologise.</p> <p>“It is not clear why MPs were not treated in the same, allegedly heavy-handed, fashion as their staffers,” Glass said.</p> <p>“It may relieve the sense of unfairness that at least some of those arrested must have felt, if senior police command would acknowledge this and apologise to them.”</p> <p>Victoria police said it would not apologise for making the arrests.</p> <p>“Victoria Police acted appropriately when arresting the 17 former field officers,” it said in a statement.</p> <p>“It is not uncommon for simultaneous arrests to occur where there are multiple persons of interest in an evolving investigation.”</p> <p>Other issues – including whether the public service has become politicised, the work of the premier’s social media unit staff and the “new trend” of factional powerbrokers working as lobbyists – will be the subject of an upcoming report from Glass.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/27/manchin-deal-democrats-schumer-reconciliation-bill-climate-health","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US

It excludes surtaxes on people making at least $10m a year, ending Democrats’ push to make the wealthiest Americans pay more taxes.</p> <p>The proposal would invest $396bn in energy security and fighting climate change, and $64bn to bolster healthcare.

His spread of impressively formed characters reveal a breadth of different reasons for being anti-immigration, racist and unwilling for change. There’s Lawrie (Richard Riddell), who spits hate out freely; landlady Gina (Sian Reese-Williams) who insists she’s not racist but calls the Black friends of her son “bad news”; and the comparatively calm policeman, Lee (Alexander Cobb), who fears for his life after being stabbed by a Black man while on duty. Together, they present a bleak picture.</p> <p>Carried by a cast of immeasurable talent, there are some spine-tingling performances. Riddell’s Lawrie is ready to snap at any second while Michael Hodgson is spectacularly chilling as Alan, the Enoch Powell-quoting bar frequenter whose calm-voiced hatred is the most fearful of all.</p> <p>With the 2022 men’s World Cup on the horizon and racism among football fans still rife, Nicole Charles’s production, revived by Joanna Bowman, feels burningly resonant.

There is now genuine optimism that Patrick Vieira can take the perennial mid-table finishers into uncharted territory following a promising first campaign at the helm with an exciting young squad.</p> \n<p>Remarkably, the Frenchman took only a few weeks to transform Palace from the dogged defensive side that hit opponents on the break under Roy Hodgson into a team that plays exciting, possession-based football and does not just rely on old talisman Wilfried Zaha. He and captain Joel Ward are the only remaining players from Holloway’s side that won promotion in 2013, with the 29-year-old Ivory Coast forward contributing his best-ever return of 14 goals in the Premier League last term.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"398fc60c-c54d-4d56-ba80-e368a9f4303a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WkJAG7mah9M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Retaining Zaha’s services with less than 12 months of his contract now remaining will of course be a priority for Vieira and the chairman, Steve Parish, although there are other areas of concern such as filling the Conor Gallagher-shaped hole in midfield. The Chelsea loanee was the heartbeat of Palace’s team last season and while they have acted decisively to sign the Mali international Cheick Doucouré from Lens to play in the holding role, concerns over the fitness of 34-year-old James McArthur means more cover is needed.</p> \n<p>As well as the burgeoning partnership between Marc Guéhi and Joachim Andersen, the arrival of USA defender Chris Richards from Bayern Munich and England goalkeeper Sam Johnstone to provide competition with Vicente Guaita and Jack Butland should at least provide Palace with the defensive solidity they need to stay well clear of trouble. After that, a repeat of last season’s FA Cup run or securing a top-10 finish – only the third in the club’s history – could be well within their grasp.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/crystal-palace/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>There were many who doubted the former Arsenal midfielder’s credentials when he was chosen as the man to succeed Hodgson last summer. Yet the transition of Palace’s approach with largely the same group of players has shown that Vieira is certainly managing to convey his message effectively. He will have learned from the defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final when he opted to change formation in the absence of Gallagher and paid the price with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/17/chelsea-crystal-palace-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report\">a 2-0 defeat</a>. But if anyone doubted Vieira’s new allegiance to south London then his frustrated reaction to Arsenal’s last-gasp equaliser during the seesaw match <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/18/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">at the Emirates in October</a> was enough evidence he now bleeds red and blue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2707e54fccf2e5d0e958b92de4cf18ab0dcc68a5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2707e54fccf2e5d0e958b92de4cf18ab0dcc68a5/235_0_3364_2816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira signs autographs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in July during the club’s pre-season tour to south-east Asia and Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"837\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira signs autographs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in July during the club’s pre-season tour to south-east Asia and Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Pockett/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Having to release a statement in July which said he had been a victim of blackmail and “an attempt to extort funds from several individuals acting in concert” was not quite how Doucouré would have hoped to have started his Palace career. The 22-year-old Mali midfielder has denied accusations that he has “a double identity” and pledged to take legal action. Born in Bamako and having made his name in France with Lens, Doucouré could be exactly what Palace have been missing.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>With only a handful of players, including Andersen of Denmark and Jordan Ayew of Ghana, likely to be involved at the World Cup, the rest of Palace’s players will have an opportunity to recharge their batteries at home. Guéhi and Tyrick Mitchell will hope they can book a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:26:23/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Palace\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:26:23/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>Croydon’s town centre used to be renowned for its shopping but times have changed and sadly the Whitgift Centre isn’t quite the same draw these days. Try heading down to see the dinosaurs in Crystal Palace park instead - they were unveiled in 1854 as the first dinosaur sculptures in the world.</p> \n<h2>Leading the shirt sales</h2> \n<p>While Zaha remains the king of SE25, there is a new prince in town. Michael Olise has captured the hearts of Palace supporters thanks to his breathtaking performance in the FA Cup victory over Millwall in January that kickstarted an incredible run of form. Had it not been for the foot injury that hampered the France Under-21 forward towards the end of the campaign, he could easily have been subject to offers from bigger clubs this summer but will probably benefit significantly from another year under the tutelage of Vieira and his staff.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>Zaha’s 1.1m followers put him way out in front and barely a day goes past without an Insta update. Having not travelled with the main squad for their tour to Singapore and Australia after not meeting the entry requirements when the trip was scheduled, Zaha has regularly been keeping fans up to speed while he trains in south London. Meanwhile, the dapper Olise has also been dipping his toes into the world of social media with some seriously cool poses in various shades.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"F\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed–overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed–the-fiver\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>If Palace were a Netflix doc …</h2> \n<p>While the Channel 4 documentary “The Academy” following players from the club’s youth set-up is set to be broadcast in August, a sequel to the excellent “When Eagles Dare” – the Amazon series which tracks Palace’s journey from the brink of bankruptcy to the Premier League – could also be on the cards if they can build on the promise of last season. After two chastening FA Cup final defeats to Manchester United in 1990 and 2016, perhaps Vieira is the man to finally lead Palace to glory? <br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2022/jul/28/mps-call-for-menopause-to-be-protected-characteristic-in-uk-equality-act","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T23:01:31Z","webTitle":"MPs call for menopause to be protected characteristic in UK Equality Act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/28/mps-call-for-menopause-to-be-protected-characteristic-in-uk-equality-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jul/28/mps-call-for-menopause-to-be-protected-characteristic-in-uk-equality-act","fields":{"headline":"MPs call for menopause to be protected characteristic in UK Equality Act","trailText":"Amendment would include duty for employers to provide reasonable adjustments for menopausal employees","byline":"Caroline Davies","body":"<p>MPs have called for menopause to be a protected characteristic and for a special ambassador to keep women in the workplace, after a report showed the UK is currently “haemorrhaging talent”.</p> <p>Employers’ lack of support for menopausal symptoms is pushing “highly skilled and experienced” women out of work, according to the cross-party women and equalities committee.</p> <p>Their report calls on the government to amend the Equality Act to introduce menopause as a protected characteristic and to include a duty for employers to provide reasonable adjustments for menopausal employees.</p> <p>The MPs are also urging ministers to remove dual prescription charges for oestrogen and progesterone as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), replacing it with a single charge.</p> <p>With 4.5 million women aged 50-64 currently in employment, the report highlights the knock-on effects of being out of work on the gender pay gap, the pension gap and numbers in senior leadership positions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Research showed that women experiencing at least one problematic menopausal symptom are 43% more likely to have left their jobs by the age of 55 than those experiencing no severe symptoms, while research by Bupa shows that 900,000 women experiencing the menopause have left work.</p> <p>The report recommends a menopause ambassador could produce model policies and disseminate good practice, in collaboration with employers, unions and other stakeholders.</p> <p>It also criticised an “unacceptable” postcode lottery for access to specialist care and recommends there should be a specialist menopause service in every clinical commissioning group.</p> <p>The report found stigma, lack of support and discrimination were key factors in women leaving the work place; that the current law does not serve or protect menopausal women; and women felt their GP was not well equipped to properly diagnose or treat menopause with women also paying more than they should for prescriptions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/20/hormone-replacement-therapy-to-be-offered-over-the-counter-in-uk\">Hormone replacement therapy to be offered over the counter in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It called on the government to launch an immediate consultation on introducing menopause as a protected characteristic, launch a public health campaign on menopause symptoms, and pilot a “menopause leave” policy within the public sector.</p> <p>The women and equalities committee chair, Caroline Nokes MP, said: “The omission of menopause as a protected characteristic under the Equality Act is no longer tenable, given that 51% of the population will experience menopause.</p> <p>“Menopausal women have been mocked and maligned for too long.

For all the breathtaking moments England’s players have provided in their run to the final, there will be nobody quite like Popp on the Wembley pitch this Sunday.</p> <p>When she planted another thrusting header to crown the group stage win over Denmark, months after recovering from a potentially career-ending cartilage tear, one of this summer’s good news stories was already guaranteed. Two other injuries had deprived her of European Championship action in 2013 and 2017. Always prolific, she had never quite been lucky; now she is making up for lost time and, with six goals in five games, has made history on her 119th cap.</p> <p>Popp does not stop. She has torn into opponents with three tournaments’ worth of energy, creating both goals against Austria by closing down poor Manuela Zinsberger, and has built a head of steam that most 31-year-olds can no longer muster. Her approach is of a piece with Germany’s unremitting, insistent style and fed into the tie’s wider narrative. If the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/26/england-sweden-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">previous night’s semi-final</a> became memorable for its flourishes of sheer audacity and the host nation’s ensuing euphoria, this clash quickly cast a spell through its brutal, relentless force.</p> <p>Neither France nor Germany had shown much capacity to ease off in their previous four games, even if early batterings of Italy and Denmark respectively proved exceptions in terms of victory margin. Nobody can stay with either set of players unless they run, run, run: it inevitably meant that, when they met, the result was a tempo rarely matched even at this level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa784b63fe6e72336b5ae289e41d94934a720b4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa784b63fe6e72336b5ae289e41d94934a720b4e/0_182_5459_3275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grace Geyoro attacks for France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany’s semi-final with France was played at a tempo rarely matched at this level.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What a spectacle this was: a meeting of two sides crashing into each other. To the eye Germany appeared slighter, defter, more capable of moving the ball fluidly through the intelligent positioning and smart feet of their No 10 Lina Magull; every loss of possession, though, turned butterflies into wasps who swarmed into opponents with structured fury. Early on three players chased down a defender who had the audacity to clear near the corner flag; in the 23rd minute another four were back to crowd out Delphine Cascarino as she led a break towards the box. France, full of threat when they could escape the clutches and locate Kadidiatou Diani on the right, tended to require cruder means when thwarting German incursions. Magull did scupper her own dart into the box, though, with an egregious first-half dive.</p> <p>When Germany opened the scoring, the goal distilled their most appealing facets. Svenja Huth, redeployed to the left because of the unfortunate Klara Bühl’s Covid-19 diagnosis, scurried in like a flash to seize on a loose defensive touch. Seconds later she had appeared on the opposite side of the pitch to continue the move and clip a perfect cross that, flying on in the volley, Popp flashed high into the net.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Popp did not let up from there and nor, on the whole, did Germany. There were still moments that will pique England’s interest: Austria had struck the woodwork three times in their quarter-final and, when Diani did the same here, her thundercracker of a drive rebounded in off Merle Frohms. Every tournament-winning side needs an in-form keeper and Frohms was properly worked after that, answering questions with sound handling along with important second-half saves from Bacha and Diani. For such a purring, undeniably well-drilled force, Germany have given teams glimpses in the past week: England should prove more capable than anyone else of taking any invitation.</p> <p>That is if Popp has not stolen in on the blindside and whipped it away. At the end she fell to the floor, arms stretched out, swamped by teammates who knew exactly what this had taken. One more night like this, and match number 120 will complete the fairytale.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/27/covid-study-finds-millions-have-long-term-smell-or-taste-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T22:30:30Z","webTitle":"Covid study finds millions have long-term smell or taste problems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/covid-study-finds-millions-have-long-term-smell-or-taste-problems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/27/covid-study-finds-millions-have-long-term-smell-or-taste-problems","fields":{"headline":"Covid study finds millions have long-term smell or taste problems","trailText":"Researchers say about 5% of infected adults may develop long-lasting changes to sense of smell or taste","byline":"Andrew Gregory Health editor","body":"<p>Millions of people worldwide may have long-term smell or taste problems as a result of Covid-19, with women more likely to be affected, a study suggests.</p> <p>About 5% of adults infected with the coronavirus may develop long-lasting changes to their sense of smell or taste, according to the research published in the BMJ.</p> <p>With more than 550m confirmed Covid-19 cases to date, it means there may be long-term smell deficiencies for 15 million people and taste problems for 12 million (with an unknown overlap of those suffering both) for at least six months after an infection.</p> <p>Given the devastating effect that loss of smell and taste can have on quality of life and wellbeing, this will have a huge impact on global health, the team of international researchers say. </p> <p>Loss or change of sense of smell or taste can lead to “severe distress”, they say, and they call for health systems to be better prepared to support people who often feel “isolated” when dismissed by clinicians.</p> <p>Daily activities such as smelling coffee and testing the flavour of food can become “disgusting and emotionally distressing”, experts say.</p> <p>The study reviewed data from 18 studies involving 3,699 patients.

It also follows difficult earnings from other tech firms including Snap, Twitter and Netflix, as fears of a recession grow.</p> <p>“We seem to have entered an economic downturn that will have a broad impact on the digital advertising business,” chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said on a call with investors on Wednesday. “The situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago.”</p> <p>For the second quarter ending 30 June, Meta said total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ads, fell to $28.82bn from $29.08bn a year earlier. Meta shares fell nearly 5% in after hours trading following the rare backslide.</p> <p>Meta’s earnings further underscored an inflation-induced slowdown in the digital ad industry, which has been booming for decades as companies tapped the power of the internet to reach consumers. Tech firms are also struggling to maintain booming growth seen during the pandemic, which bolstered online activity as more people quarantined at home.</p> <p>In addition to the broader economic downturn, Meta faces a string of unique<strong> </strong>challenges to its business, including stiff competition from TikTok and Amazon for ads and a revenue hit from Apple’s privacy changes to its mobile operating system iOS.</p> <p>The company has attempted to stop young users from fleeing its platforms by bolstering its short-form video content. Meta reported a 30% increase in time spent on Reels, its copy of rival TikTok, across Instagram and Facebook. However, those videos do not monetize at the same rate as traditional content, Zuckerberg said on the call, and will take time to stabilize.</p> <p>“In the near term, the faster that Reels grows, the more revenue that actually displaces from higher-monetizing surfaces,” he said. “Obviously, there is a cannibalistic impact, but the net impact is positive.”</p> <p>Zuckerberg repeatedly stressed the massive impact of Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/14/facebook-v-apple-the-looming-showdown-over-data-tracking-and-privacy\">2021 change</a> to its operating system. The company allowed users to opt out of digital tracking, torpedoing Facebook advertising revenue, and the company revealed in its second quarter report that the average price per ad had dropped 14%.</p> <p>“Apple’s iOS privacy changes mean that Meta has lost some of the rich data tracking that powers its ad business,” said Tom Johnson, global chief digital officer at market analysis firm Mindshare Worldwide. “It will be hoping that its efforts to create a more frictionless commerce experience on the platform will compensate for this over time.”</p> <p>In the call with investors, Zuckerberg said the advertising downturn underscores the importance of shifting to the metaverse – which will create a platform that Meta controls entirely.</p> <p>“Given some of the product and business constraints that we face now, I feel even more strongly now these platforms will unlock hundreds of billions of dollars – if not trillions over time,” Zuckerberg said.</p> <p>But scaling the metaverse has been an uphill battle, as Meta sinks billions into the project.

Often, as it careers around a lushly stylised Russian royal court in the 1760s, it’s concerned with pleasure directly: few comedies feature quite so many banquets, while the frequency with which The Great mentions or depicts cunnilingus must be record-breaking. It satirises the 18th-century Russian ruling class, and by extension all ruling classes, as chronic overindulgers, their eyes rolled too far back into their heads to see the damage they do.</p> <p>But we at home, too, are gripping the arm of the sofa and gasping, because now The Great is into its second season, it is so assuredly in the groove. Every scene, every line of Tony McNamara’s script carries its own wicked hedonism: there is always something to enjoy that’s ruder, sillier or sharper than other shows would dare to include.</p> <p>To recap: Catherine (Elle Fanning), a young German princess, has arrived in Russia to find that its emperor, Peter III, her arranged husband, is a corrupt manchild who is a danger to the citizenry and the people around him, since he is obsessed with his own desires – food, sex, violence – and maddeningly adept at using them to retain power. A monster of a performance by Nicholas Hoult makes Peter a very funny caricature of a ruler intoxicated and infantilised by privilege, who can turn and become chillingly ruthless if that luxury is threatened.</p> <p>Catherine vows to depose him, which she must if she’s to become Catherine the Great. We return to our loose rendering of that transfer of power – in terms of historical accuracy, this show is looser than a goose on payday – in the aftermath of Catherine’s attempted coup.</p> <p>It has not been wholly successful. Her husband is frustratingly still alive, with both spouses’ supporters entrenched as they fight for the royal palace – as in, they’re at war for the palace itself, since he’s in the east wing and she’s in the west, behind barricades made of exquisite furniture.</p> <p>As she plots to finally overthrow Peter and stand up for compassionate rationality against capricious depravity – all while expecting her first child – Fanning’s Catherine remains a fine heroine, encompassing childish vulnerability, cold determination and curious free thinking. The last of those is to the fore when she apparently, casually, invents the molotov cocktail while brainstorming schemes to get hubby to move out.</p> <p>The ongoing battle between thoughtful, doubtful Catherine and the utterly shameless Peter (“She will not beat me, because I’m … me”) is delicious, yet The Great’s most powerful weapon is its revolving cast of hilarious supporting players, all of whom come back on ripe form: Douglas Hodge as General Velementov, the bibulous military strategist, or “balloon-shaped traitorous fuck”, as Peter calls him; Adam Godley as Rasputin-esque theological guru Archie, biding his time: “God will blow the right wind soon. We wait on his perfect whim. Have an oyster”; Belinda Bromilow still delivering a magnificently double-edged turn as Elizabeth, Peter’s aunt, who may favour her nephew’s wife over her own flesh and blood and can be trusted not to gouge Catherine with a hatpin while she sleeps. Probably.</p> <p>Bromilow’s scenes with Fanning are key to The Great’s genius. The women in this show know they’re engaging in a nightmarishly accelerated feminist struggle, in which the wrong move means degradation or death; when The Great began, the misogyny was on occasion hard to watch. But then it became clear Catherine had the guile to survive, and a strength derived from not being quite alone; in this carnival of bachannal and absurd violence, the moments where two women share counsel form the series’ serious spine. The exchanges here where Catherine discusses the child she is carrying and the one Elizabeth once lost are precious, especially for the way Bromilow weaves a thread of blackest desolation into her general shtick of bright-eyed, possibly sinister eccentricity.</p> <p>Equally, as lady’s maid Mariel, Phoebe Fox can do snarky swagger and mortal fear at the same time, because her character needs the former to stay sane in the face of the latter. And a reunion with Mariel is a chance for Catherine to share the experience of pregnancy with her friend: “It is real, but also not real. And I piss myself a lot and like to eat dirt. I think if God really loved women, we’d lay eggs.”</p> <p>Still present and highly enjoyable are the drinking, double-crossing and elite swearing. Season two’s first episode contains three startlingly crisp C-words, including one from Julian Barratt as a quack physician who intends to insert a sage bundle into the royal one. Thanks to those flashes of tough or tender reality, The Great has licence to let rip. Long may it party hard.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/27/indiana-investigates-abortion-doctor-10-year-old-rape-victim","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T22:03:19Z","webTitle":"Indiana investigates abortion doctor who treated 10-year-old rape victim ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/indiana-investigates-abortion-doctor-10-year-old-rape-victim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/indiana-investigates-abortion-doctor-10-year-old-rape-victim","fields":{"headline":"Indiana investigates abortion doctor who treated 10-year-old rape victim ","trailText":"State attorney general notifies Dr Caitlin Bernard and claims ‘she used a 10-year-old girl to push her political ideology’","byline":"Maya Yang","body":"<p>The Indiana state attorney general has launched an investigation into the doctor who performed an abortion on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/03/ohio-indiana-abortion-rape-victim\">10-year-old rape victim</a>.</p> <p>According to Kathleen DeLaney, a lawyer acting for the doctor, Caitlin Bernard, a notice from the Indiana attorney general, Todd Rokita, regarding his investigation arrived on Tuesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/15/indiana-caitlin-bernard-doctor-abortion\">Daughter of doctor who gave 10-year-old an abortion faced kidnapping threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We are in the process of reviewing this information.

The reports added that the patient who sought the abortion had become pregnant as the result of sexual abuse.</p> <p>A 27-year-old man has since been charged in Columbus, Ohio, in connection with abuse of the girl.</p> <p>Since the abortion, Bernard became the center of a political firestorm from rightwing media outlets and Republican politicians after Joe Biden expressed sympathy for the girl when he signed an executive order earlier this month aimed at safeguarding abortion access after the supreme court’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court\">action in upending</a> the historic 1973 abortion case Roe v Wade.</p> <p>According to DeLaney, Bernard is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/15/doctor-10-year-old-rape-victim-abortion\">considering</a> taking legal action against “those who have smeared my client”, including Rokita, who previously said that he would investigate whether she violated abortion reporting or child abuse notification laws.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian on Wednesday, Rokita said: “The baseless defamation claim and other accusations are really just attempts to distract, intimidate and obstruct my office’s monumental progress to save lives. It will take a lot more than that to intimidate us.</p> <p>“The doctor alone brought this case to the press. She used a 10-year-old girl – a child rape victim’s personal trauma – to push her political ideology.

Tough, because you’re getting one: England v South Africa in a three-match, five-day T20 series. They play in Bristol tonight, Cardiff tomorrow and Southampton on Sunday, when not even a 22-man brawl would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/i-should-have-scored-with-my-first-shot-russo-says-backheel-born-of-frustration\">steal the back page</a>.</p> <p>Bilateral series are ephemeral, and not in a good way, but this one isn’t without significance. The World Cup is less than three months away, and both teams are finalising their plans. Or, in England’s case, hastily editing them after the retirement of Eoin Morgan.</p> <p>His replacement Jos Buttler, England’s ace in T20 cricket, had a poor series against India and will be keen to get back to six-hitting normality, if only to silence the media and the troll in his head. At least he won’t be facing Bhuvneshwar Kumar this time. There are a few doubts over England in white-ball cricket just now. An in-form Buttler, and a series win over South Africa, would banish plenty of them. </p> <p>A year ago, this would have been a home banker. Now, not so much. South Africa have improved significantly in T20s in the last year or so, winning 15 or their last 19 games. (Before that – and yes I am using arbitrary cut-off points to make the stats a bit more impactful, and yes I know Bill Frindall is probably turning in his grave – they’d won three of the previous 18.) </p> <p>They beat England at last year’s World Cup, only missing a semi-final place on net run-rate, and recently drew 2-2 away to India. Even without the injured captain Temba Bavuma they look a strong side, especially as Kagiso Rabada is back after being rested for the ODIs. Rilee Rossouw, who walloped 93 off 36 balls for Somerset in the T20 Blast the other week, is also in the squad after a six-year absence. </p> <p>It’s a good test for both sides, just the kind they need in a World Cup year. See, I’ve almost talked myself into being excited about the series.</p> <p><strong>Tonight’s match begins at 6.30pm.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T17:14:32.608Z\">at 6.14pm BST</time></p>  </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/27/england-south-africa-first-t20-international-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T21:16:43Z","webTitle":"Bairstow and Moeen provide fireworks as England sink South Africa in first T20","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/27/england-south-africa-first-t20-international-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/27/england-south-africa-first-t20-international-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Bairstow and Moeen provide fireworks as England sink South Africa in first T20","trailText":"Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali starred with the bat as England beat South Africa by 41 runs in the first T20 international","byline":"Simon Burnton at Bristol","body":"<p>On a postage-stamp ground where the bowlers mustered few special deliveries and the batters sent most of their messages by air mail, there was one particularly memorable arrival. England eventually romped to victory by 41 runs, but even on a night when Moeen Ali scored England’s fastest ever half-century in the format and Jonny Bairstow flayed his way to 90, the most memorable contribution came from South Africa’s Tristan Stubbs, a 21-year-old playing his first international innings.</p> <p>Fully 120 of England’s 234 runs came from sixes, their 20 maximums more than they had ever scored before, or South Africa had conceded. With the tourists further dispirited by a series of failures in the field – even discounting the one Heinrich Klaasen lost in its flight and allowed to float over his head, Bairstow was dropped three times – their run chase seemed destined to be forlorn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/27/england-v-south-africa-first-t20-international-live\">England beat South Africa by 41 runs: first T20 international – live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But for long periods it was also quite a lot of fun, with Reeza Hendricks scoring a half-century off 28 balls – positively pedestrian in this company – and Stubbs, who instantly found a beautiful seam of form and kept coming up with diamonds, facing the same number of balls and scoring 72. England seemed to have no way of controlling him, and with the second game of the series coming in Cardiff on Thursday they do not have long to produce some fresh ideas. “I’m sure we’re going to have some plans and talk about him tonight,” Moeen said. “Hopefully that won’t happen again this series.”</p> <p>Four of the first 11 deliveries the debutant faced went for six and his half-century came off only 19 balls, just three more than Moeen’s. For as long as he remained at the crease South Africa had a chance of victory. “During training he’s shown us what he can do so we weren’t really surprised,” Lungi Ngidi said of Stubbs’s display. “He’s a very, very confident chap. We’re happy he got a chance to show the world what he’s capable of.”</p> <p>But with those present scenting an explosive finale, England’s death bowling proved decisive and after Chris Jordan leaked only four runs from the 18th over and Stubbs fell to the first ball of the next, South Africa’s innings rapidly unravelled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e5617a2308b666e00215abf4f848dc719e27412\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e5617a2308b666e00215abf4f848dc719e27412/73_0_4031_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tristan Stubbs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tristan Stubbs made an extraordinary first international innings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Stirk/ECB/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the toss Jos Buttler had called this “the start proper” of his side’s T20 World Cup campaign, and by the time they next play a 50-over game it will be November and that tournament will be over. It was a toss that Buttler yet again lost – he is now 8-2 down since taking over the captaincy last month, and is on a statistically improbable run of seven successive losses – and David Miller decided it would be wise on this small ground to see precisely how much carnage their opponents could create before his side had to judge the pace of their own innings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The answer in this case was plenty. It took a while for England to really get going, but when they did it was savage – at one point they scored 81 off just four overs as Bairstow and Moeen hit their stride and their opponents lost their bearings.</p> <p>Bairstow, rewarded for his phenomenal form so far this summer with a roar from the crowd as he made his way to the crease, surfed a wave of form and fortune to reach 90 off 53 before Rilee Rossouw finally held one in the final over. He appeared completely untroubled by the injury to his left knee, which was wrapped in ice as soon as the game concluded. But it was Moeen, who ended with 52 off 18, who nudged England’s total beyond South Africa’s reach.</p> <p>“It’s a nice size ground for someone like myself who’s not a massive hitter of the ball,” Moeen said. “The record means a lot, because there’s guys in our changing room that score quick and I can brag about having the fastest 50 in T20s. I’ll go in the dressing room and give it big ones in a minute.”</p> <p>The first hint of the riches on offer for batters came from Buttler, whose stay at the crease was brief but brutal. He faced only seven balls but managed to accumulate 22 runs, with two sixes and a couple of fours, before he misjudged his attempt to hit another maximum off an Ngidi slower ball and Miller took a superb catch at long-off.</p> <p>England’s other opener had a precisely contrasting experience, Jason Roy labouring to a 15-ball eight full of shanks and mis-hits before top-edging Ngidi to backward point. At home this summer Roy is averaging 17.77 in white-ball cricket and just 9.75 in his four T20 innings, and looks worryingly short of confidence. The ease with which he watched so many others scoring probably did not help.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2022/jul/27/germany-v-france-womens-euro-2022-live-score-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T21:06:50Z","webTitle":"Germany 2-1 France: Women’s Euro 2022 semi-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/jul/27/germany-v-france-womens-euro-2022-live-score-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2022/jul/27/germany-v-france-womens-euro-2022-live-score-updates","fields":{"headline":"Germany 2-1 France: Women’s Euro 2022 semi-final – as it happened","trailText":"Germany captain Alexandra Popp broke the record for scoring in the most consecutive Euros matches to break French hearts","byline":"Sarah Rendell","body":"<div id=\"block-62e1a84a8f081e9f3bd219b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T21:06:50.440Z\">10.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thank you so much for joining me for this semi-final</strong>, it lived up to expectation!

They are “really really good,” she added, almost as if to temper the expectations of German fans and the German media. In the buildup to the semi-final, newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ran with the headline “Eight-nil” in reference to Germany’s eight European titles to France’s none.</p> \n<p>“They focus on their play in transition because they have a lot of pace in their team and direct a lot of their attacking play down the wings,” said Voss-Tecklenburg.</p> \n<p>“I had said before the tournament already that France, if they managed to live up to their potential, would be among the favourites to win this tournament.”</p> \n<p>That was the narrative of many prior to the tournament’s kick-off in England. The France manager, Corinne Diacre, who collected her first cap in 1993 when her opposite number, Voss-Tecklenburg, had already lifted two European Championship trophies and would collect two more in the next four years, has proven divisive.</p> \n<p>The decision to leave out the Lyon duo Eugénie Le Sommer and Champions League final goalscorer Amandine Henry would strip the sheen from their challenge and spoke to discord in the player pool available for the national team. Come the tournament though, the narrative has been very different. A swaggering fast-paced picking apart of Italy in their Group D opener suggested that perhaps many were writing off France too soon.</p> \n<p>A dominant but wasteful display against the Netherlands forced them to extra time at the quarter-final stage where new Chelsea signing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/23/perisset-holds-nerve-to-sink-netherlands-and-put-france-into-semi-finals\" title=\"\">Ève Périsset’s penalty was the difference</a>. That extra 30 minutes would be added to the two days of extra rest the Germans would be afforded before the semi-final.</p> \n<p>In a buzzing Stadium MK, this was a chess match between the fluid French and gritty Germans, who have style up top through Lina Magull and Svenja Huth. It took six minutes for Germany to carve their first clear opening, with Magull springing the offside trap but the influential Lyon centre-back Wendie Renard recovered excellently to force her backwards and into taking a touch too many.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9732ff61d83d575b3e21aa422877be5a2151a5ad\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9732ff61d83d575b3e21aa422877be5a2151a5ad/0_271_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandra Popp’s powerful first-half finish puts Germany 1-0 ahead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Popp’s powerful first-half finish puts Germany 1-0 ahead.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a frenetic start to a semi-final which promised as much and not much separated the two sides. Pauline Peyraud-Magnin did well to push Popp’s free-kick round the post midway through the half but she could do nothing to stop the rocket volley that flew past her with 40 minutes played – Huth’s cross turned in with some force by the foot of Popp for her fifth goal of her first Euros despite more than 100 caps.</p> \n<p>Renard, who was stripped of the captaincy by Diacre but won the armband back, gathered her teammates in a huddle immediately. It was the first time France had gone behind. The reply was instant. Sandie Toletti found Kadidiatou Diani, who rifled a shot towards the near post which flew off the back of Merle Frohms and in – her first goal conceded at the Euros.</p> \n<p>Germany edged the second half in terms of possession, but the threat of France was always lurking and in the 63rd minute Les Bleues twice went close. First, Diani beat her marker on the left and cut back to Selma Bacha who, in acres of space, forced a smart stop from Frohms, then Renard sent a powerful header goalwards from the resulting corner but Frohms blocked it on the line. France are yet to score in the second half in the Euros – with their winner against the Netherlands coming in the first half of extra time. Then, their profligacy would not prove too costly but at the Stadium MK they risked being punished.</p> \n<p>After another handful of chances were wasted Germany struck, with Popp heading in to draw her level on six goals with England’s Beth Mead and put her team a step closer to a ninth Euros final.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\"> \n <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>France pushed for another equaliser, with Bacha sending a long-range effort narrowly wide, Grace Geyoro offside while sending an effort flying over the bar and Clara Matéo also putting the ball over.</p> \n<p>There would be no upset though, with France not having scored more than a goal in their previous two games.

Mark Smith, president and CEO of Smith &amp; Wesson Brands, had been invited to appear but refused to do so.</p> \n<p>“Mr Smith promised he would testify, but then he went back on his word, perhaps because he did not want to take responsibility for the death and destruction his company has caused,” said Carolyn Maloney, chairwoman of the House oversight committee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ee5e19c2-97b4-4c94-8372-db01925eee4c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eKKV3dG4GuM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Maloney announced that she would soon subpoena documents from Smith &amp; Wesson’s CEO and other top executives to discover more about the gun industry’s business practices. According to a committee investigation, Smith &amp; Wesson brought in more than $125m last year from the sale of assault weapons, which have been used in many mass shootings. In total, five gun manufacturers collected more than $1bn from the sale of assault rifles over the last decade, the investigation found.</p> \n<p>“The time for dodging accountability is over,” Maloney said.</p> \n<p>At the start of the hearing, the committee played a video of testimonials from families who had been affected by recent mass shootings, including the massacre at Robb elementary school in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas-school-shooting\">Uvalde, Texas</a>, and the white supremacist attack at a supermarket in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/buffalo-shooting\">Buffalo, New York</a>.</p> \n<p>Tracey Maciulewicz, who lost her fiance Andre Mackniel in the Buffalo shooting, tearfully pleaded with the gun companies to enact change in the face of so many families’ devastation.</p> \n<p>“What are you going to do to make sure that your products don’t get into the hands of a white supremacist mass shooter ever again, who will take a child’s father away?” Maciulewicz asked in the video.</p> \n<p>Rather than outlining corporate changes to prevent future tragedies like Buffalo, the gun company executives deflected responsibility for mass shootings, instead blaming individual bad actors and policy failures to prevent violent crime.</p> \n<p>“These acts are committed by murderers,” said Daniel, whose company sold the assault weapon used in the Uvalde shooting. “The murderers are responsible.”</p> \n<p>Killoy, the CEO of the largest manufacturer of rifles in the US, similarly argued it was wrong to blame the “inanimate object” of a firearm for deaths caused by gun violence.</p> \n<p>“We firmly believe that it is wrong to deprive citizens of their constitutional right to purchase a lawful firearm they desire because of the criminal acts of wicked people,” Killoy said. “A firearm, any firearm, can be used for good or for evil. The difference is in the intent of the individual possessing it, which we respectfully submit, should be the focus of any investigation into the root causes of criminal violence involving firearms.”</p> \n<p>Republicans on the committee echoed the executives’ argument, accusing Democrats of demonizing gun manufacturers while promoting “soft on crime” policies.</p> \n<p>“It’s absolutely disgusting to me and unthinkable, the height of irresponsibility and lack of accountability,” said Jody Hice, a Republican of Georgia. “My colleagues seem to forget that the American people have a right to own guns.”</p> \n<p>At one point, two committee members got into a heated exchange, as the Republican Clay Higgins accused Democrats of leaving average Americans more vulnerable to gun violence by pushing restrictions to firearm access.</p> \n<p>Higgins argued that law-abiding Americans would be more likely to get injured in a shooting if they were not armed as well, saying, “My colleagues in the Democratic party, when those gun fights happen, that blood will be on your hands.”</p> \n<p>The Democrat Gerry Connolly fiercely rejected that charge, telling Higgins, “We will not be threatened with violence and bloodshed because we want reasonable gun control.”</p> \n<p>The committee hearing came as House Democrats attempt to pass additional gun-control legislation, including a ban on assault weapons. A House committee advanced the assault weapons ban last week, but it remains unclear whether the full chamber will approve the proposal.</p> \n<p>Several House Democrats have indicated they do not support the ban, and the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, can afford to lose only four votes if every Republican opposes the bill. The House Democratic caucus chair, Hakeem Jeffries, expressed confidence that the ban would ultimately pass, although it does not appear the bill will come up for a vote this week.</p> \n<p>“I expect that, if the assault weapons ban hits the floor, that it will pass, and I personally and strongly support it,” Jeffries said Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/25/joe-biden-signs-gun-control-law\">already signed</a> one gun-control bill last month, in the wake of the tragedies in Uvalde and Buffalo. But many Democrats argued that the compromise bill, which expanded background checks for the youngest firearm buyers and provided more funding for mental health resources, did not go far enough to address gun violence.</p> \n<p>In addition to the assault weapons ban, House Democrats are considering a bill to strip gun manufacturers of civil liability protections. At the Wednesday hearing, Maloney indicated she would soon introduce more bills to regulate firearm manufacturers, saying lawmakers have a responsibility to the many families who have lost loved ones to gun violence.</p> \n<p>“Since it’s clear that the gun industry won’t protect Americans, Congress must act,” Maloney said in her closing statement. “This is a fight we must and will win.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/jul/27/surrey-v-warwickshire-lancashire-v-kent-and-more-county-cricket-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T20:22:32Z","webTitle":"Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire all fight back: county cricket – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/27/surrey-v-warwickshire-lancashire-v-kent-and-more-county-cricket-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/jul/27/surrey-v-warwickshire-lancashire-v-kent-and-more-county-cricket-live","fields":{"headline":"Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire all fight back: county cricket – as it happened","trailText":"<strong>County Championship:</strong> After a poor first-innings total, Lancashire have a lead of 252 over Kent, while Somerset saved the follow-on against Essex","byline":"Emma John","body":"<div id=\"block-62e1a0458f08127940906b15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T20:30:24.129Z\">9.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That’s it for the evening folks</strong>, see you back here in the morning for the final day.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62e19e768f08127940906b09\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T20:22:32.208Z\">9.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Emma John's roundup</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong>, <strong>Lancashire</strong> and <strong>Derbyshire</strong> can all congratulate themselves on their fighting spirit at the end of this third day’s play.

Matt Henry had picked up two by the time he completed his over from the previous evening and finished with five for 45 as <strong>Lancashire</strong> added a measly 33 for their final six wickets. <strong>Kent</strong> were then 12 for three before a Joe Denly‑Jack Leaning rescue mission, and a cavalier half-century from Grant Stewart, saw them to 270, a lead of 125.</p> <p>At Scarborough, <strong>Hampshire</strong> only gained a footing when Ben Brown and Keith Barker came together at 72 for six; Barker’s run-a-ball 52, and similarly entertaining cameos from the tail, inspired a 59-run lead. <strong>Yorkshire</strong> finished 23 for one in reply.</p> <p>The <strong>Surrey</strong> bowlers Conor McKerr and Jamie Overton contributed valuable runs at The Oval, where a sparkling 65 from Ollie Pope was the top score for the home side. Their 316 gave them a 63-run lead against <strong>Warwickshire</strong>, who negotiated the final two overs of the day without loss.</p> <p><strong>Gloucestershire</strong>’s bowlers fought back to keep themselves in the game after <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>’s Ryan Rickelton and Luke Procter put on 111 for the third wicket; Rickleton was out just five short of his century to Zafar Gohar, who took four in the innings. Northants finished 353 for seven, a lead of 36.</p> <p>In Division Two, Anuj Dal top-scored for <strong>Derbyshire</strong> for the second time in two days. His 85 not out in a seventh-wicket partnership with Mattie McKiernan helped his side to turn a 55-run deficit into a 231-run lead, after they had bowled <strong>Worcestershire</strong> out for 185 earlier in the day.</p> <p>And Ollie Robinson took four for 44 as <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> were bowled out for 240 on the first day of their match against <strong>Sussex</strong> at Trent Bridge, before James Pattinson and Dane Paterson proved equally destructive, leaving the visitors 94 for five at the close.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62e0ffe48f081e9f3bd211ca\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T10:33:05.532Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Morning everyone</strong>, are we all ready for day three?

The title story was previously <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/old-babes-in-the-wood\">published in the New Yorker</a> and is about two elderly sisters at a family cabin by a lake.</p> <p>Publisher Vintage said the stories “explore the full warp and weft of experience, from two best friends disagreeing about their shared past to the right way to stop someone from choking; from a daughter determining if her mother really is a witch to what to do with inherited relics such as second world war parade swords”.</p> <p>The publisher went on to say: “They feature beloved cats, a confused snail, Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell, philosopher-astronomer-mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria, a cabal of elderly female academics, and an alien tasked with retelling human fairy tales.”</p> <p>The thread throughout the book is a “sequence” of tales about a married couple as they travel together and the moments that make up a long life of love, said Vintage.</p> <p>Atwood said of the collection: “Old Babes in the Wood is a mixed bag, like life. It contains bad taste, also like life. Is a story about a woman who is a snail at heart really about being quite old? Maybe. Are dead beloveds actually dead in any real sense of the word? Maybe not. Are cats what they seem? Hardly ever.”</p> <p>The Booker prize-winning author’s last book was Burning Questions, a collection of essays published earlier this year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/03/burning-questions-by-margaret-atwood-review-wisdom-and-wonder\">Reviewing the book in the Guardian</a>, Shahidha Bari said Atwood was “frank, honest and good company”. Before that, she published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/23/dearly-by-margaret-atwood-review-the-experience-of-a-lifetime\">Dearly</a> in 2020, which was her first collection of poetry for a decade, described by the Observer as “wry and entertaining”.</p> <p>Atwood’s last foray into fiction was The Testaments, which jointly won the Booker prize with Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other. It is a sequel to her 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale, which was adapted into the award-winning television series.</p> <ul> <li><p>Old Babes in the Wood by Margaret Atwood (Vintage Publishing, £20).

The MP for Rhondda said he had seen the same documents as Seely, claiming that these included “an allegation of money laundering”.</p> <p>Because of parliamentary privilege, Chandler was unable to take action until Bryant tweeted a letter he had sent to Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, about sanctions against Russia, which directly quoted what he had said about the businessman in the Commons.</p> <p>According to a statement released on behalf of Chandler, the claims of money laundering and links to Russian intelligence were investigated by Richard Walton, a retired police officer who formerly headed the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, and were found to have “no basis whatsoever”.</p> <p>Chandler said he was “grateful to Mr Bryant for not opposing this long overdue correction of the public record”, adding: “After four long years, we are delighted to be able to put these bizarre and outrageous lies behind us.”</p> <p>In a statement, Bryant said the statement repeated what he had said in May this year during a debate about foreign lobbying. He added: “While I do not accept that what I published was libellous I am happy for the record to be set straight.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 28 July 2022.

If the case goes to court despite their efforts, they use very expensive lawyers to keep the school’s names out of the court papers on grounds of protecting the children. What that means is that the school’s failings in tolerating an abuser don’t get revealed so they can avoid addressing it.”</p> <p>Richard Scorer, the head of abuse law at Slater &amp; Gordon, who represented many of Jimmy Savile’s victims, has had many similar experiences. “Many private residential schools have changed their legal status over past decades – dissolving the company through which they operated and becoming a new legal entity, in some cases more than once,” he says.</p> <p>“In some instances, it appears that this has been done deliberately in order to escape legal liability for past abuse. Where liabilities are not transferred to the new entity, and no insurance existed for the old one, claims for damages can be stymied and victims are left uncompensated.”</p> <p>Part of the solution would be to have mandatory reporting of sexual abuse in schools. Tom Perry, founder of Mandate Now and the first complainant in the Caldicott school <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/prep-school-teacher-peter-wright-accused-sex-abuse-caldicott\">child sexual abuse scandal</a>, has long campaigned for those working in schools, healthcare and faith settings to have a statutory obligation to report known or suspected abuse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It sounds incredible but reporting of known or suspected abuse is discretionary,” he says. “All we have – unlike other countries including France, America and Australia – is an expectation that a report ‘should’ be made.”</p> <p>Perry dismisses claims that “it’s all different now”.</p> <p>“The foundations of institutional safeguarding, which we are attempting to overhaul, remain unchanged since the 50s,” he says. “The current law is an unwieldy patchwork of inconsistencies with hundreds of different rules in different places.”</p> <p>In the absence of a legal overhaul, Renton believes boarding schools are simply unsafe. “I’m the first person in my family in about seven generations not to send their children to boarding school,” he says. “I just wouldn’t do it.

That is why people can repeatedly catch common colds, and why it is possible to be infected multiple times with different variants of Sars-CoV-2.</p> <p>A universal coronavirus vaccine would need to trigger antibodies that recognise and neutralise a range of coronaviruses, scientists said, stopping the virus from entering hosts cells and replicating.</p> <p>In the new study, the researchers investigated whether antibodies targeting the “S2 subunit” of Sars-CoV-2’s spike protein also neutralise other coronaviruses. The researchers found that after vaccinating mice with Sars-CoV-2 S2, the mice created antibodies able to neutralise a number of other animal and human coronaviruses.</p> <p>They included the common cold coronavirus HCoV-OC43, the original strain of Sars-CoV-2, the D614G mutant that dominated in the first wave, Alpha, Beta, Delta, the original Omicron and two bat coronaviruses. The findings are published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</p> <p>“The S2 area of the spike protein is a promising target for a potential pan-coronavirus vaccine because this area is much more similar across different coronaviruses than the S1 area,” said the study’s co-first author, Kevin Ng, of the Francis Crick Institute. “It is less subject to mutations, and so a vaccine targeted at this area should be more robust.”</p> <p>Until now, the S2 area of the spike protein had been overlooked as a potential basis for vaccination, the researchers said.</p> <p>George Kassiotis, corresponding author and principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute, said: “The expectation for a vaccine that targets the S2 area is that it could offer some protection against all current, as well as future, coronaviruses.</p> <p>“This differs from vaccines that target the more variable S1 area which, while effective against the matching variant they are designed against, are less able to target other variants or a broad range of coronaviruses.</p> <p>“There’s a lot of research still to do as we continue to test S2 antibodies against different coronaviruses and look for the most appropriate route to design and test a potential vaccine.”</p> <p>The researchers will continue their work studying the potential of a pan-coronavirus that targets the S2 area of the spike protein and how it could be integrated with currently licensed vaccines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nikhil Faulkner, a co-first author, also of the Francis Crick Institute, said: “While a potential S2 vaccine would not stop people being infected, the idea is it would prime their immune system to respond to a future coronavirus infection.</p> <p>“This would hopefully provide enough protection to survive an initial infection during which they could develop further immunity specific to that particular virus.”</p> <p>Prof Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, who was not involved in the study, said a universal coronavirus vaccine “could solve the problem of endless new waves of disease caused by variants with reduced vaccine sensitivity”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/jul/27/modern-herpes-variants-may-be-linked-to-bronze-age-kissing-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T18:00:24Z","webTitle":"Modern herpes variants may be linked to bronze age kissing, study finds ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/27/modern-herpes-variants-may-be-linked-to-bronze-age-kissing-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/jul/27/modern-herpes-variants-may-be-linked-to-bronze-age-kissing-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Modern herpes variants may be linked to bronze age kissing, study finds ","trailText":"Virus may have received a boost from rise of kissing that came with westward migrations 4,500 years ago","byline":"Ian Sample Science editor","body":"<p>The herpes variants that cause modern cold sores became widespread in the wake of bronze age migrations, and may have received a boost from the practice of kissing that came with it, researchers say.</p> <p>Scientists in Cambridge analysed the first ancient DNA specimens of herpes simplex virus and found that one variant overtook all others about 4,500 years ago, setting the course for its dominance today.</p> <p>“The variants around in Europe today all share an ancestor in the bronze age,” said Dr Charlotte Houldcroft, a virologist on the study. “There were variants around before that, but those have been replaced, probably because of human behaviour.”</p> <p>The herpes simplex virus, or HSV-1, infects nearly 4 billion people globally. It is thought to have emerged millions of years ago, before humans split from their primate relatives. But the lack of ancient herpes DNA has left scientists unclear as to how it has evolved since humans spread out of Africa.</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"https://www.science.org/journal/sciadv?cookieSet=1\">Science Advances</a>, the team describe how they screened ancient DNA recovered from about 3,000 archaeological sites and found only four individuals – from the UK, the Netherlands and Russia – who had herpes infections.

Two others were buried in the Cambridge area: a woman in her 30s or 40s at an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Edix Hill, and a man in his late teens or early 20s at St John’s hospital. A third skeleton, that of a man in his mid 20s to 30s, whose bent teeth betrayed a penchant for clay pipe smoking, came from a burial ground on the bank of the Rhine, a probable victim of a French attack on his village in 1672.</p> <p>Analysis of the ancient DNA showed that the herpes virus then was remarkably similar to the virus seen today and could be traced back to the bronze age. The timing coincides with vast migrations into Europe from the grasslands of Eurasia and a population boom that could have sent transmission rates soaring.</p> <p>But another factor may have come into play, the scientists suggest. The earliest known written record of kissing is a bronze age manuscript from south Asia. Far from being a cultural norm, kissing may have arrived with the westward migrations, providing a new route for the virus to spread. Until then, the argument goes, herpes was largely passed on from mother to child, limiting its transmission.</p> <p>“If you suddenly have a group of people who are kissing, which was not a universal human behaviour, that is an extra way to spread the virus,” said Houldcroft.</p> <p>But she said there was a need for more evidence. “Kissing is one of those behaviours that doesn’t fossilise well. The risks of kissing were certainly apparent to the Romans. Centuries later, Emperor Tiberius tried to ban kissing at official functions to stop the spread of disease.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team, who include researchers from Tartu University in Estonia, are now keen to discover more ancient herpes DNA to help them piece together more of the virus’s backstory.

gas flow through Nord Stream 1 to 33m cubic metres a day – about 20% of the pipeline’s total capacity and half the amount it has been delivering since resuming service last week after 10 days of maintenance work.</p> \n  <p>According to network data from the gas transfer station in Lubmin, north-east Germany, only about 17m kilowatt hours of gas arrived between 8am and 9am, compared with more

Kherson, with Russian anti-missile air defences apparently failing to intercept the strikes. There were also reports that a railway bridge was targeted.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Self-appointed authorities in the occupied Kherson region have closed the bridge to traffic, but said it was structurally sound and that repairs would begin shortly.</strong> Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Russian-imposed administration, said “There are hits on the bridge, the bridge has not been destroyed. More holes have been added”. He claimed that the attack would make life slightly more difficult for the resident of Kherson, but “it will not affect the outcome of hostilities in any way.”</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/ukrainebridges-zip/giv-6562IpwJMtW44p9G/\" data-alt=\"A map of the Kherson region.\"> \n   <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/ukrainebridges-zip/giv-6562IpwJMtW44p9G/\">A map of the Kherson region.</a> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>One person has been killed and four wounded in a Russian attack on a hotel in Bakhmut in the Donetsk region</strong>, according to local emergency services and the regional governor.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The self-proclaimed republic in <strong>Donetsk</strong> has said that two civilians were injured in territory it occupies by shelling from Ukrainian forces overnight.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The <strong>UK’s Ministry of Defence</strong> has said “Russian private military company Wagner has likely succeeded in making tactical advances in the Donbas around the Vuhlehirska power plant and the nearby village of Novoluhanske.

The need for a third support package is inescapable","byline":"Nils Pratley","body":"<p>In the contest to mouth the words “tax cuts” as often as possible to attract the gaze of Tory party members, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/sunak-promises-scrap-vat-on-fuel-bills-pm-dramatic-u-turn-leadership-truss\">Rishi Sunak now says he would remove VAT on energy bills for a year</a>. However much his camp protests otherwise, this is a U-turn of the screeching sort. As chancellor, Sunak had two goes at constructing an energy support package for households and he kept the 5% VAT rate in place both times.</p> <p>More importantly, it’s a U-turn that does not come close to recognising the size of the hit coming to the pockets of poorer households. The sums here are not difficult. At £3,400 – a reasonable estimate for October’s price cap for an average household – axing VAT would produce an annual saving for consumers of £170. At £3,850 – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/27/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-3850-pounds-russia-cuts-gas-supply-further-europe-pipeline\">the more speculative estimate of where the cap could be set in January</a> if Russia continues to reduce gas flows through Nord Stream 1 to a trickle – we’re talking £192.50.</p> <p>Now consider the current level of the cap (£1,971) and remember that Sunak was assuming £2,800 when he put together his second support bundle. If we could now be contemplating a level nearer £4,000 in the new year, chopping 5% off the top wouldn’t move the dial meaningfully for poorer households. An unaffordable bill would be 5% smaller, but would still be unaffordable. Remember, too, that January tends to be a month of peak consumption, a significant factor for pre-payment customers.</p> <p>Exactly the same criticism of fiddling around the edges can be made of Liz Truss, incidentally. The foreign secretary sometimes talks as if axing “green levies” is the answer to everybody’s prayers. Those levies, shown as the “policy” element in the breakdown of bills, are projected by the regulator Ofgem to be £155 from October. Again, the dial doesn’t move far.</p> <p>Sunak was right the first time about scrapping VAT on domestic fuel bills. It is a measure that “would disproportionately benefit wealthier households”, he said in February. The same point was made by the Institute for Fiscal Studies on Wednesday – richer households tend to use more energy, so would benefit most in cash terms.</p> <p>The costs of scrapping VAT for a year would be bearable for the Treasury, added the IFS, but the risk is that it would be “politically difficult” to restore the policy. “As a permanent policy, removing VAT on energy bills would be a move in exactly the wrong direction: distorting households’ choices towards more energy use, making it harder to meet the UK’s net zero targets and meaning that any reduction in emissions happened in a way that was more costly overall to households than it need be,” it said.</p> <p>The inescapable conclusion, which both PM candidates must grasp, is that a third support package will be needed in October. Flashy, but inconsequential, tweaks with VAT or green levies aren’t going to cut it, and would create longer-term problems. Bring on the real debate.</p> <h2>At the ready to help struggling customers: Lloyds can afford it</h2> <p>The old rule of thumb said that Lloyds Banking Group, the UK’s biggest lender, is a barometer of the health of the UK economy. That rule is out of date. The bank’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/lloyds-profits-take-hit-after-putting-more-money-aside-for-defaults\">first-half financial report</a> – profits higher than expected, full-year guidance raised, dividend up 20% – was almost perky, which is definitely not the mood of the nation.</p> <p>A key factor is that banks enjoy periods of rising interest rates. They improve net interest margins, the difference between what is paid to depositors and what is charged to borrowers. Lloyds now expects a margin above 2.8 percentage points this year, as opposed to 2.54 in 2021, a significant jump when you’re making loans and advances of £7.5bn in six months.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lloyds hasn’t seen the increase in bad debts that one might assume during a cost of living crisis. An impairment charge of £200m in the second quarter should be seen in the context of a very large bank with 26 million customers that takes such charges in the normal course of business. Across the half-year, defaults were below pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p>The chief executive, Charlie Nunn, was careful to sound the necessary notes of caution and sympathy with customers. About 1% – so 260,000 people – are “really struggling to make ends meet”, he said, and 20% had adjusted their spending “significantly”.</p> <p>But the bottom line for Lloyds is that its customer base is skewed towards middle- and upper-income households who are more able to adapt. The biggest worry for banks in downturns tends to be surging unemployment, which hasn’t happened this time. Lloyds stands ready “to proactively help potentially impacted customers”, added Nunn. So it should: it can afford it.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T17:44:41Z","webTitle":"Shadow ministers question Labour’s stance on strikes after Tarry sacking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer","fields":{"headline":"Shadow ministers question Labour’s stance on strikes after Tarry sacking","trailText":"Labour MP removed from role as shadow transport minister after ignoring warning not to join picket lines","byline":"Jessica Elgot","body":"<p>Senior shadow ministers have privately expressed doubt that Labour’s position on strikes is sustainable, after Keir Starmer sacked the frontbencher Sam Tarry for doing broadcast interviews from a rail strike picket line.</p> <p>The Guardian understands Tarry was told he was sacked as shadow minister for buses and local transport for saying that it was “not acceptable to offer below inflation pay rises” because it would be a real-terms pay cut for workers.</p> <p>Tarry was told Labour’s position was that it was for ministers and unions to negotiate terms. That dispute is likely to cause significant alarm from trade unions about Labour’s position, including those affiliated to the party.</p> <p>Frontbenchers told the Guardian they could be put in untenable positions with multiple industrial actions planned by unions in the coming months – including by rail workers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/19/royal-mail-staff-vote-strike-pay-dispute-cwu\">postal workers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/18/strike-chaoes-teachers-nhs-staff-action-pay-rail-unions\">NHS staff and teachers</a>. “There are a lot of people saying, I don’t know if I can stay on the frontbench,” one senior source said.</p> <p>But there is also significant anger from the leader’s office that Tarry conducted a media round without any prior warning, and multiple sources suggested he had been goading Starmer to sack him in order to help him fight a difficult deselection battle.</p> <p>“Sam Tarry did a full media round without his boss Lou Haigh [the shadow transport secretary] or the leader’s office knowing in advance,” a Labour source said. “This represents a total breakdown of discipline and put the leadership in a position where it was impossible to do anything else.”</p> <p>Starmer has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/labours-sam-tarry-joins-rail-workers-on-picket-line-in-defiance-of-keir-starmer\">told shadow ministers not to join picket lines</a>, stressing that Labour is a party seeking to govern that should aim to solve disputes. Several shadow ministers who joined picket lines during the last strike did not lose their jobs, despite the warning.</p> <p>A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party will always stand up for working people fighting for better pay, terms and conditions at work. </p> <p>“This isn’t about appearing on a picket line. Members of the frontbench sign up to collective responsibility. That includes media appearances being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions.</p> <p>“As a government in waiting, any breach of collective responsibility is taken extremely seriously and for these reasons Sam Tarry has been removed from the frontbench.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tarry, a former officer of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) union who helped run Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaign, has not previously joined picket lines as a shadow minister, though he had tweeted a picture of himself alongside workers on an earlier strike day.</p> <p>The TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said he was ashamed of the party. “Whatever excuses the Labour party makes about the reasons for Sam being sacked, the reality is that Sam has shown solidarity with his class and we applaud him for that,” he said.</p> <p>“If they think can win the next general election while pushing away 7 million trade union members, they are deluded.”</p> <p>The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, called the sacking “another insult to the trade union movement. Quite frankly, it would be laughable if it were not so serious. </p> <p>“At a time when people are facing a cost of living crisis, and on the day when the Conservative government has launched a new wave of attacks on the rights of working people, the Labour party has opted to continue to indulge in old factional wars.”</p> <p>Tarry, who is in a relationship with the Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said in a statement he did not regret his actions. “As a Labour politician, I am proud to stand with these striking rail workers on the picket line in the face of relentless attacks by this Tory government,” he said.</p> <p>“It has been a privilege to serve on Labour’s frontbench for the past two years and to have had the opportunity to speak up for hard-pressed workers who deserve so much better than the treatment they’ve received from this corrupt and out-of-touch government.”</p> <p>Ruth Jones, a shadow environment minister, has also posted pictures supporting the latest strike, though not directly from picket lines. Shadow ministers including Alex Sobel and the Labour whip Navendu Mishra were spoken to by whips for joining pickets at the last strike but did not lose their jobs.</p> <p>One shadow cabinet source said they believed Starmer’s position on picket lines would become unsustainable as the number of disputes intensified.</p> <p>“There will be other frontbenchers who will want to support striking workers in their constituencies,” they said. Another Labour source said: “Postal strikes will be a nightmare because it’s potentially hundreds of people in your constituencies. This would be supporting very moderate unions affiliated to the party. And MPs depend on support from unions.”</p> <p>However, senior Labour sources said they were sceptical of Tarry’s motives and linked it to his re-selection battle in Ilford South. Wards in Tarry’s constituency voted unanimously for a full reselection – meaning he is likely to lose the seat.</p> <p>They suggested Tarry was in effect daring Starmer to sack him. One called it “a pathetic, cynical stunt to get sacked”, and said: “He didn’t go to the first picket but has turned up now. So what has changed?”</p> <p>Tarry said after the interviews that he remained on the side of the striking rail workers. He has previously written to Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, suggesting he had seen evidence of voting irregularity in his selection battle.</p> <p>Tarry won selection in the east London seat in 2019 after the local council leader, Jas Athwal, was suspended from the party in the run-up to the vote over allegations of inappropriate behaviour. Athwal, an ally of the neighbouring MP Wes Streeting, was subsequently cleared in an internal investigation.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/27/fans-allowed-to-stand-at-european-ties-for-the-first-time-since-1988","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T17:43:31Z","webTitle":"Fans allowed to stand at European ties for the first time since 1988 ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/fans-allowed-to-stand-at-european-ties-for-the-first-time-since-1988","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/27/fans-allowed-to-stand-at-european-ties-for-the-first-time-since-1988","fields":{"headline":"Fans allowed to stand at European ties for the first time since 1988 ","trailText":"Fans are to be allowed to stand at European fixtures for the first time since 1988 next season after Uefa announced a trial of safe standing","byline":"Paul MacInnes","body":"<p>Fans are to be allowed to stand at European fixtures for the first time since 1988 next season after Uefa announced a trial of safe standing.</p> \n<p>A ban imposed in the aftermath of the Heysel Stadium disaster, which has been in place for more than 30 years, is to be reviewed.

Parliament sits for about 20 weeks a year.</p> \n<p>Sitting days are bound by rules set out in what are known as “standing orders”.</p> \n<p>The day starts with government business, which is when planned issues or proposed laws are presented and debated. Members then give statements to parliament until 2pm, when question time starts. Question time is the liveliest part of the day, when parliamentarians take questions from their opposing members, but also from their own party (this is called a “Dorothy Dixer”, see below).</p> \n<p>After QT is the presentation of documents. Then comes the matters of public importance: a discussion on one issue, usually brought up by the opposition, criticising how the government is doing something.</p> \n<p>After that are prepared statements from any ministers who want to speak, and finally the day ends on more government business.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2f43dc3e6529d68af84f22c4ad77821a182d0fe\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2f43dc3e6529d68af84f22c4ad77821a182d0fe/0_290_4556_2735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The black rod is carried at Parliament House in Canberra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The black rod at Parliament House in Canberra.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>What is the difference between the House and Senate?</h2> \n<p>The Australian parliament is split into two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p> \n<p>The Senate has red seats and carpet, with 76 senators that represent states and territories. The House of Representatives has green seats and carpet, with 151 members that each represent an electorate.</p> \n<p>Bills (AKA legislation) usually originate in the House of Representatives. To become law, they have to pass a vote in both the house and the Senate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d8b657b9-e085-4d39-9c2f-e82024e8cbb1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eC_QqArDDiQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What does it mean when standing orders are ‘suspended’?</h2> \n<p>It is not unusual for the house or Senate to suspend a standing order – ie to press pause on one of those rules governing how they operate. This is so they can do something that would otherwise not be allowed: for example, introduce a proposed law that has not been scheduled for debate, or discuss new business after a sitting day has ended.</p> \n<p>More than half (an absolute majority) of the house or Senate needs to vote in favour of a motion to suspend.</p> \n<h2>Is there a code of conduct for parliamentarians?</h2> \n<p>There is, and it covers things like using “objectionable words” or disregarding the authority of the speaker. A “disorderly” member can be told to leave the debate for an hour by the Speaker. </p> \n<p>This mostly happens during question time, which is the shoutiest part of the sitting day.</p> \n<h2>How long can an MP absent themselves from parliamentary sittings?</h2> \n<p>There is no limit to the amount of leave an MP can take.</p> \n<p>There has only ever been one federal MP booted from the parliament for taking leave – John Ferguson, who wanted to separate central Queensland from Brisbane, and was mostly against the White Australia policy (of 1901) as well as bills which sought to deport Pacific labourers. He was also very ill and only attended 128 days of the 222 days parliament sat and then was on leave without absence for two months. And that is what got him kicked out – he triggered a constitutional amendment. That was in 1903 and was the first and only time it has happened.</p> \n<h2>Why are prayers read before parliament, in a secular nation?</h2> \n<p>Good question! Each sitting of the parliament has begun with a prayer in both chambers since federation in 1901, and it is mostly because of tradition – the UK and other common law parliaments, like Canada, also begin parliamentary sittings with this tradition.</p> \n<p>In Australia, the prayers are part of the standing orders, so in order to be changed, there would have to be an amendment to the standing orders. Attempts to do this in the past (and replace prayers with a moment of prayer or reflection) have failed. In 2010, the standing orders were changed to add an acknowledgment of country before the reading of prayers.</p> \n<h2>Who is the Speaker of the House?</h2> \n<p>The speaker acts like a chairperson – running the House of Representatives debate and making sure standing orders are obeyed. They don’t usually contribute to debates, and they don’t vote unless there is a tie.</p> \n<p>Over in the senate, that role is played by the president.</p> \n<p>The speaker is chosen in a secret vote after the official opening of parliament. You may have seen the speaker “dragged” to the chair after they are appointed to the position. Not in the “drag them” sense, but the successful nominee does pretend to be quite reluctant about taking up the role.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter6/The_Office_of_Speaker_\">The parliament website</a> describes it thusly:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>The custom had its origin in the genuine reluctance with which early Speakers accepted the office, for the role of spokesman for an emerging body of legislators bent on opposing the royal will was a dangerous occupation. </em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>What are backbenchers?</h2> \n<p>Our parliament has both frontbenchers and backbenchers. If you imagine the layout of the House of Representatives, the front row of seats facing the speaker are where the ministers (frontbenchers) sit, and the backbenchers sit behind them.</p> \n<p>Backbenchers are members of parliament who are not ministers or shadow ministers. They represent and advocate for their electorates and debate and vote on proposed laws.</p> \n<p>Without their votes, governments can’t pass legislation in the house. In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-party\">Liberal party</a>, where MPs can vote against legislation without ramifications, this theoretically gives them a lot of power. For Labor, voting against a caucus decision means expulsion from party, so it is a little more tricky for them.</p> \n<h2>What are committees?</h2> \n<p>Parliament can appoint a group of up to 10 members of parliament to investigate specific issues or proposed laws. This is a select parliamentary committee.</p> \n<p>The committee invites submissions on the issue from experts, interest groups and the community. They also hold public hearings where they can hear directly from these groups. Their findings are reported back to the house.</p> \n<p>The parliament considers the committee’s findings, but it doesn’t mean it will adopt them.</p> \n<h2>What on earth does ‘I move that the member be no longer heard’ mean?</h2> \n<p>In the House of Reps, a member of parliament can propose that the member speaking “be no longer heard”. If the house votes in a majority to move the proposed motion, the member speaking must immediately stop talking and sit back down. There is no procedure like this in the Senate.</p> \n<p>In the previous parliament, the former government would “move the member no longer be heard” almost every time there was a motion to suspend standing orders, which Labor argued was shutting down debate. It will be interesting to see how Labor handles these interruptions to the schedule.</p> \n<h2>What is question time?</h2> \n<p>Each parliamentary day includes a dedicated “question time”, when all the members are present in the chamber and, usually, the most topical, challenging and controversial conversations are had.</p> \n<p>Question time is usually held for an hour, but it is at the prime minister’s pleasure, meaning it is the PM who calls time on it. That can be abused when it suits the government. Malcolm Turnbull once allowed question time to keep going and going as his government tried to run down the clock on a medevac bill vote it didn’t want held. Scott Morrison would cut QT short when there was an issue he didn’t like being prosecuted by the Labor shadow ministers.</p> \n<p><strong>What does it mean when a question is ‘put on notice’?</strong></p> \n<p>Sometimes a minister is asked a question that they cannot or do not want to answer. The question is then “taken on notice”, and will be responded to later in writing.</p> \n<p>The answer, once prepared, is always available on the parliament’s <a href=\"https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/parliament-and-its-people/people-in-parliament/hansard/\">public record</a>. </p> \n<p><strong>Is that different from ‘questions on notice’?</strong></p> \n<p>Yes! There is a difference between a question being “put on notice” and “questions on notice”. Questions on notice are written questions to a minister from a member of parliament, usually asking for detailed information. The answers are also published.</p> \n<p><strong>Why is everyone talking about Dorothy Dixers?</strong></p> \n<p>A Dorothy Dixer is a question planted by a government minister and asked by a backbencher of their own political party during question time. The dixer tactic has a few goals: to give free publicity to the government, to help the minister speaking look good, to make the opposition look bad, to raise the profile of the backbencher asking the question, or to waste the available question time to avoid harder questions.</p> \n<p>The term Dorothy Dixer has been used in Australian politics since the 1950s.</p> \n<p><strong>So … who is Dorothy Dix?</strong></p> \n<p>She was an American advice columnist who was known to make up and submit her own questions so she was able to publish more interesting answers in her columns.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"What is a Dorothy Dixer\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia/video/7122724183557049601&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7122724183557049601&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; > <section> <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@guardianaustralia&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia&quot;>@guardianaustralia</a> This is what <a title=&quot;dorothydix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dorothydix&quot;>#DorothyDix</a> is up to in Australia’s parliament <a title=&quot;auspol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/auspol&quot;>#auspol</a> <a title=&quot;auspolitics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/auspolitics&quot;>#auspolitics</a> <a title=&quot;albo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/albo&quot;>#albo</a> <a title=&quot;albanese&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/albanese&quot;>#albanese</a> <a title=&quot;australia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/australia&quot;>#australia</a> <a title=&quot;learnontiktok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/learnontiktok&quot;>#learnontiktok</a> <a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;♬ original sound - Guardian Australia&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7122724192243485441&quot;>♬ original sound - Guardian Australia</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>What are green papers?</h2> \n<p>A green paper is a government document that goes through details of specific issues, and outlines potential policy and legislation changes for those issues (for example, a green paper about the issue of an ageing population and the potential for a new aged care system).</p> \n<p>A green paper doesn’t actually commit to any action or change. Instead, it is to prompt discussion, and acts like a first step towards changing the law.</p> \n<p><strong>What about the white ones?</strong></p> \n<p>After a green paper is published, the government consults the public for their thoughts and feedback. From those discussions, a white paper is born.</p> \n<p>White papers are documents with actual legislative intention, proposing change to policy or law. They are sometimes debated before a bill is produced. </p> \n<h2>What is a bill?</h2> \n<p>A bill is basically a proposal for a new law, or a change to an existing law.</p> \n<p>A bill is first introduced into either the House of Representatives or Senate, and has to be passed by a majority vote in both chambers.</p> \n<p>If successful, it is signed by the governor general – this is the royal assent, and is the last step before the bill becomes law. Then the bill is known as an Act of Parliament, which will give a date that the new law will begin.</p> \n<p>Sounds simple enough, but it can take years for a bill to pass through parliament.</p> \n<h2>What is a maiden speech?</h2> \n<p>The first speech given by a newly elected member of parliament is sometimes referred to as a maiden speech.</p> \n<p>There is a tradition that a first speech is heard without interruption. However, that tradition has been broken before. For example, Pauline Hanson was interrupted when she said “I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians” – among other things – in her 1996 maiden speech.</p> \n<p>Technically, Australia’s parliament doesn’t really use the term “maiden speech” any more. (On the parliamentary website they are just called “first” speeches.) But colloquially, the term is still used.</p> \n<h2>What is a conscience vote?</h2> \n<p>A conscience vote allows members of parliament to vote according to their personal beliefs rather than along party lines.</p> \n<p>These votes are usually used for social issues like abortion and euthanasia.</p> \n<h2>What is that ominous Black Rod?</h2> \n<p>You might have seen a rod made of ebony with a silver crown that is carried around in the Senate. It is a ceremonial object carried by the Usher of the Black Rod while doing things like escorting the President of the Senate into and out of the Senate and delivering messages or bills to the House of Representatives.</p> \n<p>The Usher of the Black Rod is a tradition that dates back to the 1500s in Britain. They served the British House of Lords, and were an officer of a British order of Knighthood called the Most Noble Order of the Garter. If someone offended the order, the Black Rod itself was used to discipline them! (Thankfully, that tradition is long gone.)</p> \n<h2>Why is the Liberal party called the Liberal party?</h2> \n<p>The word “liberal” is commonly understood to mean progressive, so it’s confusing that Australia’s major conservative party uses the name.</p> \n<p>The word actually comes from the Latin word “liber”, which means free. In Australia, our Liberal party is more aligned with economic liberalism, or freedom for business.</p> \n<p>The Australian Liberal party developed out of conservative parties that formed in the early 20th century to oppose the growing strength of trade unions and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party\">Labor party</a>.</p> \n<p>Here is what Robert Menzies, the father of the Liberal party, had to say about it:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>… what we must look for, and it is a matter of desperate importance to our society, is a true revival of liberal thought which will work for social justice and security, for national power and national progress, and for the full development of the individual citizen, though not through the dull and deadening process of socialism.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"410cf67c-a140-4772-94a5-f95edf725809\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FJ4GJpOKkTA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>And a fun fact about picfacs</h2> \n<p>Short for <em>picture facility, </em>picfac<em> </em>is an Australian phrase (<a href=\"https://blog.oup.com.au/2018/06/oxford-word-of-the-month-june-picfac/\">at least according to the Oxford Dictionary</a>) for a photo opportunity and has been in use since the 1990s.

It comes from a fantastic Canadian mockumentary series called Nirvanna the Band the Show, and I’ve found myself singing this aloud during moments of deep trauma. Is that weird? I was humming it during a root canal quite recently, and when the dentist asked me what I was singing to stay calm, I had to explain “well, there’s this music that plays when you’re on the Wii shopping channel, and this comedy duo did a song, and …”, at which point I realised I was inflicting more pain upon her than she was upon me.</p> <h2>2.

Skateboarders rarely teleport through solid objects or flap around like a malfunctioning Billy Bass as they zip across the sky, but in Skate 3, this can, and does, happen! I also find the sound effects here almost as enjoyable as sneezing. If I ever win an award for anything, I plan on entering the room exactly like the skaters in this video.</p> <h2>5.

The US, where interest rates were raised by 75 basis points for a second month in a row by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, may already have entered a technical recession as assessed by two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, the IMF said. The pace of rate rises is the fastest since the 1980s.</p> \n<p>For China, by far Australia’s biggest trading partner, growth may slump to 3.3% in 2022. That’s the lowest in more than four decades excluding the initial Covid-sparked drop in 2020, the IMF said.</p> \n<p>“A sustained slowdown in China would have strong global spillovers, whose nature will depend on the balance of both supply and demand factors,” it said. “[F]urther tightening of supply bottlenecks could cause higher consumer goods prices worldwide, but lower demand might ease commodity pressures and intermediate goods inflation.”</p> \n<p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/australia-inflation-rate-abs-june-quarter-increase-australian-bureau-statistics-reserve-bank-rba\">June quarter consumer price index came in at 6.1%</a> – the highest in 21 years – Chalmers told journalists inflation would “get worse before it gets better, but it will get better”.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chalmers’ speech to parliament will also outline details of how slowing growth affected the new budget he plans to release in October.</p> \n<p>“Australia is outperforming much of the world, but that doesn’t make it easier to pay the bills at home,” he will say. “Our high inflation is primarily but not exclusively global.

Those demands are not unreasonable given wages have typically lagged price rises. </p> <p>Tight labour markets – including in Australia, where the jobless rate is the lowest in 48 years at 3.5% – mean employees have more bargaining power than they have had for a generation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/australia-inflation-rate-abs-june-quarter-increase-australian-bureau-statistics-reserve-bank-rba\">Australia’s inflation rate reaches 6.1% – the fastest annual increase in 21 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) wasted no time on Wednesday reminding the Labor government that it is high time workers got a look in. In the last year, an employee on an average annual income of $69,000 will have experienced a $2,350 pay cut because their salary packet hasn’t kept up with prices, the peak union body said.</p> <p>“The need to get wages moving again is urgent,” the ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, said. “Business as usual will not turn this around; it will not fix this.”</p> <p>The quirky way Australia releases inflation data also masks some of the buildup in pricing pressure.</p> <p>Unlike most comparable nations, Australia only releases quarterly statistics on prices, which the ABS is moving to change to monthly disclosures.

to Adani, its source and the price of any arrangement remains unknown.</p> <p>The Greens MP Michael Berkman raised questions on the issues at budget estimates on Wednesday night, and referred to a separate RTI request by the Australian Conservation Foundation that found Sunwater had a contract to supply water to Adani through to 31 August 2020.</p> <p>Given these prior dealings, Berkman asked Sunwater’s chief executive, Glenn Stockton, if it had any current contracts with the mining company.</p> <p>Stockton declined to answer, citing commercial-in-confidence reasons.</p> <p>Asked about the source of any water that Sunwater was providing to Adani, Stockton said its customers in the Bowen Basin received it from two key sources: via pipelines from the Burdekin River and the Eungella Dam.</p> <p>Berkman told Guardian Australia that the company needed to come clean about its dealings with Adani.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:

comments as a candidate.</p> \n<p>“I’ll make sure that any of my candidates and MPs have respectful comments on any of these issues. That’s what we’re focused on. People want to have discussions and debates, sure, but they must be respectful,” he said.</p> \n<p>Andrew Olexander, who was the first openly gay MP in Victorian parliament when he was elected to represent the Liberal party in the upper house in 1999, said Guy had the opportunity to condemn Deeming’s views.</p> \n<p>“I’m not surprised he didn’t, given my understanding of what the Liberal party in Victoria has become, but I’m deeply angered and so very disappointed,” he told Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>“I feel that the preselection of Ms Deeming is confirmation that the party is completely out of step with modern, progressive values here in Victoria.”</p> \n<p>Olexander likened Deeming’s views to those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/why-some-conservatives-see-katherine-deves-candidates-as-a-godsend\">Katherine Deves, the Liberal party’s federal candidate for Warringah</a>, who became a lightning rod for criticism over her comments about transgender people.</p> \n<p>“In many respects it’s worse than what Katherine Deves said about trans women in sports, because what Ms Deeming is doing is blaming the victim – and the victims here are schoolchildren,” he said.</p> \n<p>“She’s blaming gay and trans kids for not being liked. She’s calling them narcissistic. It’s outrageous.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Olexander was expelled from the Liberals in 2005, after he publicly spoke out against the party, describing it as <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/rebellious-lib-faces-expulsion-20051123-ge1amb.html\">run by homophobic extremists who were trying to purge it of moderates</a>.</p> \n<p>At the time, he had lost Liberal endorsement after being involved in a drink-driving crash the previous year.

The Liberal party has been taken over by religious fundamentalists, extreme conservatives and conspiracy theorists, similar to the Republicans in the US,” Olexander said.</p> \n<p>“The ordinary Liberal voter out there is seeing the Liberal party moving further and further to the right and not representing them and what they believe in.

But it hasn’t been smooth sailing.</p> <h2>The takeover</h2> <p>Before the community takeover of 2007, Petersham was typical of many Australian bowling clubs. An old guard of bowlers had been running it for decades, but its membership was in decline and ageing. Competitive bowlers were leaving for greener pastures and the club was losing money.</p> <p>Meanwhile the suburb around it was becoming <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/property/where-should-you-develop-in-sydney-follow-the-latte-and-avocado-trail-jll-says-20171101-gzck7p\">younger and richer</a>, with new residents keen to engage with their neighbourhood. But Catsi says the bowls club felt unwelcoming, like a private members club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3db28dd4e643a28d1ec9bc7998ccc50a3cec103\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3db28dd4e643a28d1ec9bc7998ccc50a3cec103/0_0_1741_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lot has changed in Petersham, including the fashion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lot has changed in Petersham, including the fashion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by the Petersham Bowling Club</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gentrification had raised the value of the land. To solve its money woes, the club considered selling the venue to developers to be knocked down and turned into townhouses. This proposal was knocked back and in 2006 another option was floated: to lease a portion of the land to a childcare centre for 99 years.</p> <p>That’s when locals started to organise. New members joined the club in order to defeat both applications<strong> </strong>and keep the entire venue as a community asset. “We saw the potential to destroy something,” says Catsi, an academic and comic who lived on the same street as the Petersham bowlo after moving to the suburb in 2001.</p> <p>The tactic paid off. In 2006, the new members voted to defeat the motion to lease the land, and the original board resigned en masse. A new board was installed, comprised of local residents and with Catsi elected as president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d13168eca0b9edec5b5cd97593d8c67cdf92fdf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d13168eca0b9edec5b5cd97593d8c67cdf92fdf8/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manager George Catsi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catsi was among the collective who voted against the old board – and eventually took it over.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The makeover</h2> <p>Catso and his neighbours suddenly found themselves trying to run a business that was failing fast.</p> <p>“We were handed the keys to the bowling club and they said – good luck,” Catsi says. “None of us had bowled before – and none of us had a hospo background.”</p> <p>The first seven years were tricky. They went through six different food operators, the committee were operating on a $30,000 overdraft, and the club needed urgent repairs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"519a406b67419ad6d0df7fa3510876f9e9a050b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/519a406b67419ad6d0df7fa3510876f9e9a050b3/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of Queen Elizabeth and a veteran’s honour boards still remain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of Queen Elizabeth and a veteran’s honour boards still remain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there were exciting things too. As music venues around Sydney were closing, the Petersham Bowling Club started two band rooms – one where the pokies used to sit – and didn’t take a cut of the door. The club soon became a fixture not only for young bands but names like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/28/the-whitlams-tim-freedman-on-loss-light-and-horseracing-i-was-a-full-time-gambler-for-four-years\">Tim Freedman</a> and Mental as Anything. </p> <p>Families were also encouraged to visit. “They say bowling greens are sacred ground, and we wanted people to walk on the sacred ground – so we let kids walk on it.”</p> <h2>Old friends return</h2> <p>These days the club’s top green functions as a park with a bar attached, with the bottom green saved for bowling. Catsi says keeping the bowling was important.</p> <p>When the new board took over, a group of older Italian men got in touch, saying they had once used the club but drifted away because of disagreements with the previous board. “The bocce boys called and said we want to come home,” Catsi says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3307feeacf79c33271111b2846096e9a35a1da8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3307feeacf79c33271111b2846096e9a35a1da8/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nice roll: a scoreboard at the Petersham bowlo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nice roll: a scoreboard at the Petersham bowlo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The club now serves as a community hub that includes a tool library as well as a regular library.

You would come here and there would be 300 people; the staff would dress up – it would be mayhem,” Catsi says.</p> <p>Before Covid, the club was turning profits in the six figures. It took a big dent during lockdowns – staff were not eligible for jobkeeper – but Catsi is optimistic it will bounce back quickly.</p> <p>The club will celebrate its 125th birthday with a “fancy, formal or flamboyant” ball, with $145 tickets that cover drinks, canapés, entertainment and “a cake in the shape of lawn bowls”, Catsi says. “We’re still here – that’s the celebration,” he says. “It’s a fantastic survival and rejuvenation story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b98e434d3365a2697ab5a200c0ac76e1abfef2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b98e434d3365a2697ab5a200c0ac76e1abfef2d/0_163_1943_1264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A place for Petersham residents – and pets – to meet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A place for Petersham residents – and pets – to meet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yeah Rad design agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We’ve lost so many bowling clubs because they haven’t been able to transition and adapt to changing demographics, social and otherwise.</p> <p>“They either go completely under or they merge with other clubs who either just shut it down and take the land [to sell to developers], or turn it into some pokie/sports bar outpost.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/16/small-fry-rock-morning-indie-gigs-concerts-children-welcome\">Nostalgia, chicken nuggets and rock’n’roll: the morning indie gigs where preschoolers are welcome</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Catsi says the kind of path taken by Petersham Bowling Club can instead have a “profound impact on the community”. </p> <p>“But it’s hard to do.

This means that the ability to buy things with your wage is now back where it was when the ALP was last in power. Fast-rising prices, combined with low wage growth, has seen a decade of real wage growth wiped out.</p> <p>The latest inflation growth figure of 6.1% over the past year was actually greeted with little surprise: it was pretty much around the expectations. Yet we should not ignore just how unusual this is.</p> <p>Over the 31 years from the start of 1991 until the end of 2021, there had only been 1 quarter out of 124 where prices rose by more than 1.75% – and that was when the GST was introduced.</p> <p>It has now happened in both quarters of this year.</p> <p>The 1.8% rise in prices in the June quarter pushed annual inflation to 6.1%, equal with the annual growth that occurred when the GST was introduced.</p> <p>Core inflation, which attempts to remove the more erratic aspects, is now growing well above the Reserve Bank’s 3% upper target level:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual inflation is now growing well above the RBA target band\">  <iframe title=\"Annual inflation is now growing well above the RBA target band\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-1jLQy\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1jLQy/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/1jLQy/\">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>Such an increase suggests we are about to see a lot more interest rate rises.

He underestimated Ukrainian resilience and European readiness to punish Kremlin aggression with sanctions. That forced Mr Putin into a longer game. Now he is betting that European reliance on Russian gas exports will corrode western solidarity, leading to a degrading of sanctions and restored tolerance of Moscow’s territorial aggressions.</p> <p>To hasten that scenario, Russia has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/21/russia-resumes-gas-supply-to-europe-via-nord-stream-at-lower-capacity\" title=\"\">cut the flow of gas</a> through the main east-west pipeline. The Kremlin’s message of strategic extortion is not subtle: go softer on the war and have a cosier winter; stay tough and freeze. European solidarity is just about holding. Earlier this week EU members <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/26/eu-agrees-plan-to-reduce-gas-use-over-russia-supply-fears\" title=\"\">agreed a deal</a> to cut gas usage by 15% as part of a phased move away from reliance on Russian supplies. But the deal is diluted by opt-outs and exceptions for various countries. Hungary, the EU state that is cosiest with the Kremlin, has not signed up at all.</p> <p>The view in Brussels is that energy security is an issue that proves the importance of transnational collaboration and should add momentum to political, economic and strategic integration. That is true in theory. In practice, it brings new tensions between member states and aggravates old ones. Spain, for example, has invested in infrastructure to help it diversify its energy supply in ways that Germany has not. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/germany-worst-in-europe-for-reliance-on-russian-gas\" title=\"\">Viewed from Madrid</a>, the demand for solidarity looks like a tax on foresight to pay for Berlin’s longstanding complacency about the strategic threat from Russia. French power supplies are mostly nuclear, but President Macron is an avowed European integrationist who fears a wider threat to the eurozone if the German economy is damaged by soaring gas bills.</p> <p>It is not only German consumers who are facing a shock. The country’s politicians are struggling to adapt to the new reality in which an attitude to Russia that they proudly thought of as reasonable and diplomatic now looks like a colossal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/germany-dependence-russian-energy-gas-oil-nord-stream\" title=\"\">geostrategic blunder</a>. That vulnerability is compounded by Germany’s decision, in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan, to phase out all nuclear power use. The wisdom of that move is also being queried.</p> <p>The long-term solution to this challenge is clear enough. It requires an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources, which has the additional benefit of being something Europe and the rest of the world urgently needs to do anyway in order to avert a climate catastrophe. But pressures of the short term push in the opposite direction – towards reviving dirty coal-burning power plants and deals with other nasty authoritarian states that have hydrocarbon resources to export. Most dangerous is the way rising fuel bills bolster the school of populist denial that says the transition to green energy is an unaffordable luxury at a time of rising inflation and slower growth.</p> <p>That argument already has a purchase in many European countries. It is not yet a prominent feature of the current Tory leadership contest but it is there, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/tory-faction-net-zero-brexit-green-policies\" title=\"\">cultivated by backbenchers</a> and imposing a reluctance on the candidates to commit wholeheartedly to any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/08/ranked-how-green-are-the-tory-leadership-candidates\" title=\"\">meaningful green agenda</a>. That is a symptom of dismal strategic myopia. Mr Putin’s cynical weaponisation of gas supplies makes the case for a new energy paradigm every bit as eloquently as the most passionate advocate of idealistic environmentalism – and in terms that speak to a more conservative audience. There are few win-win propositions in global affairs. But one that could be embraced as a cross-party consensus is the green energy route that simultaneously breaks the Kremlin’s pernicious influence and slashes carbon emissions.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/28/australia-still-failing-to-hit-more-than-two-thirds-of-closing-the-gap-targets-new-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T17:30:24Z","webTitle":"Australia still failing to hit more than two-thirds of Closing the Gap targets, new data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/australia-still-failing-to-hit-more-than-two-thirds-of-closing-the-gap-targets-new-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/australia-still-failing-to-hit-more-than-two-thirds-of-closing-the-gap-targets-new-data-shows","fields":{"headline":"Australia still failing to hit more than two-thirds of Closing the Gap targets, new data shows","trailText":"Minister for Indigenous Australians says more is needed to address systemic disadvantage as data shows four of 17 targets on track","byline":"Sarah Collard","body":"<p>The nation is failing to address the systemic disadvantages experienced by First Nations communities, according to the latest Closing the Gap data released by the Productivity Commission on Thursday.</p> <p>Four of the 17 targets are on track: the birth weights of Indigenous babies, preschool kids attending early childhood education, and youth detention rates are trending in the right direction, while gains are being seen in land and sea rights.</p> <p>As of 30 June 2021, 89.5% of Indigenous babies were born at a healthy weight compared with 88.8% in 2017 (its baseline year) while 97.6% of preschool-aged children are enrolled in early education compared with 76.7% in 2016, the baseline data year.</p> <p>The report is the second to be released after the brokering of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/29/new-closing-the-gap-agreement-commits-governments-to-work-in-partnership-with-aboriginal-groups\">new targets and a new Closing the Gap agreement</a> by the Morrison government.

Australians on the east coast can expect a nine-hour time difference, meaning the options (during waking hours) are to watch in the evenings or early in the mornings. The swimming heats generally fall in prime time, with finals kicking off in the wee hours of the following morning.

Team GB, for example, do not compete under one flag at the Commonwealth Games but split into seven constituent parts meaning England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey each compete separately.</p> <p>In terms of population, the smallest is Niue, a South Pacific island nation with a population of 1,648.

The absence of sporting powerhouses such as United States, China, ROC (Russia) and Japan also significantly increases Australia’s gold medal prospects.

This contrasts with a peak audience of 980,000 viewers watching England play India at Twenty20 cricket on BBC Two last weekend.</p> <p>Russo herself described the goal as being the upshot of a decision to find “the quickest route for me to get this ball in the back of the net”. The Manchester United player, who now has 172,000 Instagram followers, confirmed she doesn’t often score goals in such an unconventional manner and that “I don’t think you’ll see one again”. It was certainly significant, however. “To score in a semi-final and progress to the final is a huge highlight of my career,” she said.</p> <p>The England squad returned from Sheffield to their base in south-west London on Wednesday with news helicopters tracking their coach. The players now rest up before making preparations for a Wembley final at 5pm on Sunday. </p> <p>The England coach, Sarina Wiegman, who has shown herself to be as decisive a performer as any of the players on the field in these past few weeks, has said her team is “ready to write history” by becoming the first England women’s team, and the second national side, to win a major tournament. But with “football’s coming home” now echoing once again across the country, she observed the broader significance that victory might achieve.</p> <p>“We said before the tournament and throughout that we want to inspire the nation, I think that’s what we’re doing and making a difference. The whole country is proud of us and even more girls and boys will want to play football.”</p> <p>The video of eight-year-old Tess Dolan <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2022/07/27/womens-euros-2022-watch-young-fan-going-wild-after-bbc-semi-final-17075914/\">dancing in the stands of Bramall Lane</a> after the Sweden match, another viral cut-through, seemed to symbolise the moment a lifelong engagement with sport and an active life could begin. “Going through my mind was, when I’m older I want to be a footballer,” she told BBC Breakfast. “I was looking at how they were celebrating and thinking of how I was going to celebrate.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCSport/status/1552181994217431042\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When you wake up and realise England are in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEURO2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WEURO2022</a> final 😃💃 <a href=\"https://t.co/ZPROIL1bPr\">pic.twitter.com/ZPROIL1bPr</a></p>&mdash; BBC Sport (@BBCSport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCSport/status/1552181994217431042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 27, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But 10 years after the Olympics arrived in London, a question of legacy now arises again. Can this public engagement, affection in fact, lead to more people in general and more girls in particular taking up the national game?</p> <p>BBC pundit Ian Wright said after the semi-final that “if girls are not now allowed to play football in their PE lessons just like the boys are, then what are we doing?” The words of the former England men’s international speak to the fact that, currently, less than half of the country’s secondary schools offer girls the opportunity to play football as part of the curriculum. Research compiled by the FA showed that while only a third of girls aged 5-18 participated in football each week, 91% of those without access through PE did want to play.</p> <p>“What we’re trying to break here is years of tradition, decades of tradition where football has been on offer for boys and therefore taught by male PE specialists,” says Louise Gear, the FA’s head of development. “There are fewer female PE specialists that are actually trained and competent to teach football. So there’s a confidence and a competence challenge that schools do face. That’s the biggest barrier right now.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/i-should-have-scored-with-my-first-shot-russo-says-backheel-born-of-frustration\">Leah Williamson says England’s focus is on completing their Euro 2022 task</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A lack of teaching has consequences for female participation in football more broadly, Gear says. “This isn’t about competing with other sports, this is about equality and girls being able to access football as the boys are,” she says. “What we find more often than not in secondary schools is that sports that are taught in PE and games lessons are the sports that feature in after-school clubs and competitions. The school then sets up representative sides. They then start to compete against other schools in the local area. It’s a domino effect.”</p> <p>The FA currently runs an in-school training programme for teachers, supported by Barclays, but also has another scheme that starts at a younger age. Shooting Stars, which is run in association with Disney, looks to make primary school girls confident enough to engage with the sport in the playground, a place still consistently dominated by boys.</p> <p>These changes are systemic and require resources and determination. But the impact of having role models recognisable across the country cannot be underestimated, according to Gear. “It’s absolutely huge”, she says. “Yes, they’re inspiring the whole nation – you can feel it can’t you? – but girls have to see it to believe it. They have to see these role models on the football pitch, playing at the top level, to believe that this a sport for women and girls, not just for boys and men.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/27/the-guardian-view-on-book-prizes-dont-forget-the-children","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T17:25:24Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on book prizes: don’t forget the children | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/27/the-guardian-view-on-book-prizes-dont-forget-the-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/27/the-guardian-view-on-book-prizes-dont-forget-the-children","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on book prizes: don’t forget the children","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> In a changing awards landscape, fiction for young readers should not be left out in the cold","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>The announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/26/booker-prize-longlist-of-13-writers-aged-20-to-87-announced\" title=\"\">Booker prize longlist</a> this week marks the start of the new cycle of literary prizes in the UK. The so-called “Booker dozen” of 13 novels not only offers a handy summer reading list, but represents the moment when readers start to find a shape in the deluge of titles that are published each year. At nearly 190,000 books, the UK’s annual output is the third biggest in the world, behind only China and the US. So, love them or hate them, prizes play an important part in helping readers to chart a way through.</p> <p>The landscape will be different in the year ahead, after last month’s sudden and unexplained announcement that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/10/costa-book-awards-scrapped-suddenly-after-50-years\" title=\"\">coffee retailer Costa was scrapping</a> the Booker’s main rival for literary prestige with immediate effect. Previously known as the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Costa-Book-Award\" title=\"\">Whitbread book awards</a>, the Costas offered awards in five categories – fiction, nonfiction, poetry, children’s and first novels – with an overall book of the year picked from the section winners.</p> <p>Unlike many other countries, the UK has no state-subsidised book awards, making them dependent on commercial sponsorship. This has the disadvantage of leaving them vulnerable to the whims of businesses, but it has also generated a Darwinian energy: this week’s other news was that the Rathbones Folio prize, previously a one-section generalist award with winners including the novelist Colm Tóibín, the poet Raymond Antrobus and the journalist Richard Lloyd Parry, will trifurcate to replicate three of the Costa’s sections: poetry, fiction and nonfiction, with an overall winner at the end.</p> <p>Sadly, this new list omits children’s fiction, alongside first novels. While debut fiction is well provided for – a new prize <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/category/cultural-highlights/book-awards/the-waterstones-debut-fiction-prize\" title=\"\">was launched this year</a> by the booksellers Waterstones – there will be tears before bedtime in the world of children’s literature, especially as it follows hot on the heels of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/06/childrens-books-world-reacts-to-horrible-loss-of-blue-peter-book-awards#:~:text=It%20was%20announced%20on%20Tuesday,abrupt%20end%20after%2050%20years.\" title=\"\">axing of the 22-year-old Blue Peter awards</a>. Organisers of the Rathbones Folio prize give two reasons for the omission: first, that nominations for the prize are made by an “academy” of writers that is lacking in expertise on children’s books, and second, that the gap left by the Blue Peters had been filled by the expansion of the existing <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/scholastic-expands-the-lollies-after-closure-of-blue-peter-book-awards\" title=\"\">Laugh Out Loud prize</a>.</p> <p>Neither reason will satisfy champions of children’s publishing, and with good reason. There are more than 300 members of the Rathbones Folio academy, so to add some more children’s authors to the mix would be no great problem. In terms of the intellectual landscape of publishing, there is a bigger frustration: for all its importance – and the past decades have been a golden age – children’s fiction is too often the Cinderella of publishing.</p> <p>Philip Pullman, who won the Costa book of the year for The Amber Spyglass the third instalment of his His Dark Materials trilogy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/23/shock-ending-how-costa-book-awards-changed-reading\" title=\"\">said the prize</a> was a personal gamechanger because nobody cared about the dedicated children’s awards that he had previously won. Drawing an equals sign between children’s fiction and the other four category winners was a statement about the value of children’s literature, he said. It’s not too late for that value to continue to be honoured, so that a children’s novel could once again be feted as the book of the year.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 27 July 2022. Philip Pullman won the Costa book of the year award for The Amber Spyglass, not The Subtle Knife as an earlier version said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/live/2022/jul/27/train-strikes-rail-disruption-uk-live-latest-travel-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T17:18:48Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer sacks shadow transport minister who joined picket line; train drivers vote for fresh strike – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2022/jul/27/train-strikes-rail-disruption-uk-live-latest-travel-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/live/2022/jul/27/train-strikes-rail-disruption-uk-live-latest-travel-updates","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer sacks shadow transport minister who joined picket line; train drivers vote for fresh strike – as it happened","trailText":"Labour leader fires Sam Tarry from frontbench after he gave interviews on picket line; Aslef announces drivers will strike again over pay","byline":"Jamie Grierson (now); Geneva Abdul and Tobi Thomas (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62e16a3a8f08127940906901\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T16:55:16.636Z\">5.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Evening summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has sacked one of his frontbench after he appeared on a picket line. </strong>Sam Tarry, shadow transport minister and MP for Ilford, joined workers on a picket line and made several posts to social media, as well as appearing on Sky News and Channel 4 News. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Labour party said Tarry’s removal was not about picket lines but about “collective responsibility”. </strong>A spokesperson said this includes media appearances being approved and speaking to agreed frontbench positions.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tarry said he would continue to campaign for a Labour victory</strong> in a statement with any criticism of Starmer’s position conspicuously absent.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Aslef union announced a fresh strike on Saturday 13 August.</strong> Train drivers working for nine companies will strike for 24 hours over pay.</li> \n   <li><strong>Further rail strikes are already planned for the coming weeks.</strong> About 6,000 train drivers belonging to the Aslef union across eight train companies will join the rail dispute when they strike on 30 July.

entitled to a full refund from wherever you bought the ticket. There should be no fee for this. The National Rail website has a <a href=\"https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/service_disruptions/industrialaction.aspx\">dedicated advice section</a> for affected travellers which is a good place to start, while MoneySavingExpert also has a guide on <a href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/06/train-strikes-across-the-uk-confirmed-to-go-ahead---your-refund-/#claim\">how to claim</a>.</p> \n  <p><strong>Can I travel on another day?</strong></p> \n  <p>Yes. If you have an advance, off-peak or anytime ticket for the day of the strike it will be valid for travel up to and including Tuesday 2 August. There is no need to change the date on the ticket. However, you should double-check the train company’s website as there are some exceptions. <a href=\"https://www.avantiwestcoast.co.uk/travel-information/plan-your-journey/strike\">Avanti West Coast</a>, for example, has given customers with tickets for travel from 26 to 28 July until 29 July to travel.</p> \n  <p><strong>Or travel on another train service?</strong></p> \n  <p>If you really need to travel on one of the strike days it may be possible to switch train companies or routes but your options will be limited. A revised timetable has been published and you should contact the relevant train company to find out your options.</p> \n  <p><strong>I have a season ticket – will I be entitled to a full refund?</strong></p> \n  <p>Only if your season ticket is valid for a month or longer. If that is the case, you can apply for a full refund for the strike days via the industry’s delay repay compensation scheme.</p> \n  <p><strong>What if I bought my ticket through a third party such as Trainline?</strong></p> \n  <p>Trainline said it would contact customers with an online refund for cancelled or rescheduled trains.<strong> </strong>If your train is unaffected by the strikes but your plans have changed, you can reschedule your journey at no cost or cancel it, but there may be admin fees.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T10:25:12.648Z\">at 11.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e0faea8f081e9f3bd2118c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T08:44:59.967Z\">9.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA),</strong> told the PA news agency: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Our members in Avanti West Coast are out on strike because the deep cost-of-living crisis that the Tories have created is meaning that they’re losing purchasing power.

For others, the designs were good enough to overcome that association. When the brand launched in 2017, the Guardian’s Jess Cartner-Morley summed it up in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/feb/13/up-to-date-fashion-samantha-camerons-clothing-label-cefinn\">verdict on the first collection</a>: “I will still never forgive Samantha Cameron’s husband for calling that referendum, but I would definitely wear some of these clothes.”</p> <p>Support for the Tory party has taken several more batterings since. In addition, shoppers have increasingly begun to wield wallets in line with their values – a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7aef7e9a-52af-11e7-bfb8-997009366969\">2017 survey found that</a> 57% of global consumers bought, or boycotted, products because of a brand’s stance on political or social issues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51f8fa15d238070eb48dc6d1a3c3d4b8d6484b3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51f8fa15d238070eb48dc6d1a3c3d4b8d6484b3c/31_211_2303_3216/716.jpg\" alt=\"The Duchess of Cornwall wearing Cefinn  \" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duchess of Cornwall wearing a Cefinn dress on a visit to Torquay on 20 July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Cameron’s connections have also been a help, both in concrete terms – in 2018 Cefinn received a £2.5m cash injection from the investment firm of the Tory donor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/27/lord-david-brownlow-tory-donor-paid-no-10-refurbishment-boris-johnson\">David Brownlow</a> – and in soft power terms. It can’t hurt that her sister is a former deputy editor of Vogue.</p> <p>Perhaps the brand’s biggest challenge, however, has been the changing dress habits brought about by changing work habits. “The pandemic – having disrupted how everyone works and changed office dress codes forever – has all but killed the need for this conference-call-to-cocktails work uniform,” says Graeme Moran, associate editor of industry publication Drapers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://blog.edited.com/blog/casual-vs-going-out\">According to a report by Kayla Marci</a>, a market analyst at the fashion research and advisory group Edited, “workwear trends are yet to return to traditional office attire. Products have evolved to mirror hybrid working born from the pandemic.”</p> <p>This is a shift that Cameron is mindful of. Speaking to the Telegraph in June, she said: “There isn’t a separation for most people now of work clothes and home clothes, because the two blur.” Many smart/casual brands have pivoted to the lucrative loungewear market. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/samantha-cameron-lost-lockdown-stone-time-50th-birthday/\">Cefinn’s answer has been more separates</a> – and some hidden elastication around waistlines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another pitfall is price – about £300-£400 for dresses and £200 for tops. For this kind of attire, consumers can find what they need for less from the likes of Cos, Whistles and Jigsaw. Or for a similar price there are more fashion-forward brands, such as Ganni. “The pretty printed dress market is highly competitive – brands like Rixo and Kitri come to mind – and is already oversaturated,” says Moran.</p> <p>With ethics increasingly important for consumers, brands such as Baukjen offer casual daywear that is more sustainably minded. Consumers would be unlikely to associate Cefinn, which is rated <a href=\"https://directory.goodonyou.eco/brand/cefinn\">“not good enough” on the ethical fashion app Good On You</a>, with sustainability.<br><br>While Cameron set out on a mission to make clothes for the modern woman that wouldn’t leave them “looking too corporate or feeling like a freak if they went out for a drink after work”, it seems that in the post-pandemic world, the clothes don’t veer far enough away from the photocopier. Perhaps more loungewear – and more meaningful steps towards sustainability – may help to paper over political ties.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2022/jul/27/recruitment-drives-alone-wont-fix-the-nhs-staffing-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T16:49:27Z","webTitle":"Recruitment drives alone won’t fix the NHS staffing crisis | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/27/recruitment-drives-alone-wont-fix-the-nhs-staffing-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jul/27/recruitment-drives-alone-wont-fix-the-nhs-staffing-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Recruitment drives alone won’t fix the NHS staffing crisis","trailText":"Letters: <strong>Anas Nader</strong> says the focus should be on retention, while <strong>Amanda Grantham</strong> looks to volunteer helpers.

You don’t need to be bathed in sweat. You don’t need to spend an hour hating yourself on a treadmill. You don’t even need to get that tired.</p> <p>I am sick to death of hearing how women should focus on cardio and leave the weight room to the men. We end up intimidated and unsure of ourselves, sticking to the step class when our bones are crying out for heavy resistance. There is increasing evidence that women need resistance and strength training to stave off osteoporosis post-menopause. It certainly doesn’t need to be an either/or situation, but if you’re short on time, consider the barbell and lift slightly heavier weights each week. Your joints, your children and your 80-year-old self will thank you. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Dr Bernadine Jones</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Stirling</em></p> <p><strong>• <em>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He cites Stephen Harris’s report for the Labour Animal Welfare Society as proof that the release of pheasants is fuelling an increase in the fox population. However, records suggest the number of foxes increased threefold during the 1970s and 1980s, when releasing was at a low level. Since then, releasing has maintained an upward trajectory, whereas over the same period, according to the British Trust for Ornithology’s mammal monitoring records, foxes have declined.</p> <p>Mr Glover goes on to complain about the amount of wheat put out for gamebirds, but scientific studies show that songbirds make significant use of gamebird feeders, helping to sustain them through the winter months. One study showed that a quarter of all wildlife visits to pheasant feeders were by songbirds and another showed that winter feeding gamebirds can increase songbird breeding densities the following spring. Further research has shown that 100 times more songbirds are found in crops grown for gamebirds than in conventional crops, and at the Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust’s demonstration farm in Leicestershire, game management has restored farmland bird abundance to pre-1960s levels alongside a profitable conventional farming system.</p> <p>At a time when there is little food or habitat for wildlife in the farmed environment, the impact on UK biodiversity of banning sustainable gamebird releasing and management would, paradoxically, be much more akin to “environmental carnage”.<br><strong>Dr Roger Draycott<br></strong><em>Director of </em><em>advisory</em><em>, Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/27/dont-flush-water-down-the-toilet","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T16:47:36Z","webTitle":"Don’t flush water down the toilet | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/27/dont-flush-water-down-the-toilet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/27/dont-flush-water-down-the-toilet","fields":{"headline":"Don’t flush water down the toilet","trailText":"<strong>Brief letters: </strong>Saving water | Disappearing doves | Joining the artistic dots | David Trimble tribute","byline":"Letters","body":"<p>Why does no one ever suggest that we flush the loo less often (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/25/uk-drought-extreme-heat-dry\" title=\"\">UK facing drought in August following extreme heat, 25 July</a>)?

He says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having been in power for 12 years, the Tories need to shoulder their share of the blame for this state of affairs. But unless you’re one of that blinkered sort who thinks everything was fine until Brexit, there is plenty of blame to go around. The housing crisis has been visible on the horizon for decades, as have the problems with the NHS.</p> <p>It has been much commented upon <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2022/07/which-thatcher-would-you-vote-for/\">how much Margaret Thatcher</a> has cropped up in this debate so far. But there is not much sign yet of anyone prepared to do what she did and challenge some of the fundamentals of the political order of the day. Tough words for the unions is all well and good, but striking bold poses against the vested interests of the Eighties is no substitute for confronting those of our own day.</p> <p>Unless and until we get a leader prepared to do that, this country’s long-term trajectory will continue to trend towards being poorer, and politicians will have to make harder and harder choices about how to divvy up a shrinking pie.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8f8d943-35e9-423a-9a9a-b6074a6cf29d\">Robert Shrimsley at the Financial Times</a> says Liz Truss is the right choice for the Conservative party because she represents Johnsonian cakeism. He says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The cakeist candidate is Liz Truss and the foreign secretary and frontrunner is prepared to go full gateau if it gets her to the top. While Sunak stresses the menace of inflation, his rival is offering unfunded tax cuts to drive growth and a halt to green levies to reduce fuel bills (both demands of the party’s right). </p> <p>While this might raise questions over whether she is the best person for the country, it probably makes her the right choice for this Conservative party. She offers Johnsonism without his personal deficiencies and unleashed from Sunak’s tiresome demands that spending must be funded. For all her talk to the contrary, Truss is the continuity candidate. </p> <p>But perhaps the bigger concern about a Truss premiership is that she secured her place in the final two by courting the worst people in her party. The foreign secretary has always been a more serious figure than her caricature and has, in fairness, long challenged Treasury and Bank of England orthodoxy. But ambition has seen the one-time Cameron acolyte allow herself to become the candidate of the ideological obsessives, the fantasists, the climate change diminishers, the culture warriors and those for whom Brexit can only be failing because it has not been properly tried.</p> <p>These people dismiss Sunak as a socialist and blame Johnson’s downfall on anyone but himself. Truss is smart enough to know better, but canny enough to play along. And so she promises tax cuts, higher borrowing and a more confrontational approach to Brexit.

While their price tags are high, they do little to target those hardest hit by the rise in the cost of living, due to the focus on rates of personal income taxes. Rising energy bills will bite hardest for low- and middle-income households this winter, but only 15% of the cost of scrapping the NI rise [Truss’s policy] would go to the poorer half of the population, while 28% would go to the top twentieth (figure 1). And despite both candidates recommitting to levelling up in [Monday’s] debate and despite energy bill rises being fairly evenly spread across our nations and regions, the change would widen rather than narrow regional divides.

Sunak says he would cut scrap VAT on all domestic fuel bills for just one year. The IFS says this would cost about £4.3bn.</p> <p>It says this policy would be “well targeted at those who face the biggest rise in their energy bills, but not at those – the poorest – who are least able to cope with the rise in costs”. It also says it would have a slight inflationary impact, because householders would have more money to spend on other items.</p> <p>But the IFS’s main concern with the policy is that it would be hard to reverse, and that, if the cut became permanent, that would be a mistake. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it were genuinely temporary, the fiscal and environmental costs of the policy would be bearable. The biggest risk with the policy is that it would prove politically difficult to restore VAT on energy bills at the end of the 12 months. As a permanent policy, removing VAT on energy bills would be a move in exactly the wrong direction: distorting households’ choices towards more energy use, making it harder to meet the UK’s ‘net zero’ targets and meaning that any reduction in emissions happened in a way that was more costly overall to households than it need be.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T11:56:15.266Z\">at 12.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62e11ae38f08127940906443\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T11:15:56.293Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Truss says new offence of street harassment, blocked by Johnson, would be created if she becomes PM</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Liz Truss</strong> has said that if she becomes prime minister she will create a new offence of street harassment to protect women.</p> <p>Priti Patel, the home secretary, favoured the creation of a new offence in the wake of the murder of Sarah Everard, which triggered a national debate about violence against women, but the plan was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/09/priti-patel-johnson-blocks-public-sexual-harassment-law-home-office-pm-offence\">reportedly blocked by Boris Johnson</a>.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61511890\">a BBC podcast in May</a>, Nimco Ali, who is a very close friend of Johnson’s wife, Carrie, and who was appointed as the UK government’s independent adviser on tackling violence against women and girls, all but confirmed that it was Johnson who vetoed the plan.

However, it rejected her claim against Stonewall.</p> <p>GCC, which was a member of the charity’s diversity champions scheme, argued that Bailey’s tweets went beyond expression of her gender-critical views and into abuse.</p> <p>But the panel, in <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/bailey-v-stonewall-garden-court-chambers-and-others/\">its judgment</a> handed down on Thursday, said: “We concluded that her beliefs, not just about gender self-identity but about the pernicious effect of Stonewall’s campaign promoting gender self-identity, were genuine. We also found that these amounted to beliefs, not just opinions which might change with further evidence.”</p> <p>The panel rejected Bailey’s claim that GCC’s clerks withheld work from her as a result of the discrimination, but awarded her £22,000 compensation for injury to feelings.</p> <p>After GCC’S investigation, Bailey was asked to delete two tweets but refused to do so.</p> <p>In one, she tweeted thanking the Times for “fairly &amp; accurately reporting on the appalling levels of intimidation, fear &amp; coercion that are driving the @stonewalluk trans self-id agenda”.</p> <p>In the other she said the charity had hired “a male-bodied person who ran workshops with the sole aim of coaching heterosexual men who identify as lesbians on how they can coerce young lesbians into having sex with them”.</p> <p>Responding to the decision, Bailey, who crowdfunded more than £500,000 for legal costs, said she had taken the case to bring Stonewall’s methods “into the public eye”.</p> <p>She said: “This is a vindication for all those who, like me, object to the erasure of biological sex, of women, and of same-sex attraction as material realities. It represents judicial recognition of the abuse waged against us.”</p> <p>Bailey had also claimed indirect discrimination, arguing that the gender-critical movement “is comprised predominantly of women and disproportionately of lesbians” and so these groups were more likely to be disadvantaged by the chambers’ policies.</p> <p>But the panel rejected this claim. It said it “could not conclude that Garden Court Chambers as a whole had a practice of treating gender-critical beliefs as bigoted”. It also said that even if there were such a practice, there was insufficient evidence to show that women or lesbians were disproportionately affected.</p> <p>GCC said it was considering appealing against the judgment. A spokesperson said: “We have maintained throughout that our members, quite reasonably, hold differing views in the complex debate around trans and sex-based rights. Our primary aim throughout has always been to uphold our values and maintain a workplace that is inclusive and welcoming to all.”</p> <p>A Stonewall spokesperson said it was pleased that the claim against it was rejected. “The case heard by the employment tribunal did not accurately reflect our intentions and our influence on organisations,” they said. “Leaders within organisations are responsible for the organisational culture and the behaviour of their employees and workers. Stonewall’s resources, support and guidance is just one set of inputs they use to help them as they consider how best to meet the needs of their own organisation.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/jul/27/commonwealth-games-must-confront-the-truth-about-its-sportswashing-past","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T16:30:23Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games must confront the truth about its sportswashing past | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/27/commonwealth-games-must-confront-the-truth-about-its-sportswashing-past","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/27/commonwealth-games-must-confront-the-truth-about-its-sportswashing-past","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games must confront the truth about its sportswashing past","trailText":"The Games remain an uneasy celebration of ‘common values’ with nations the British empire once exploited","byline":"Andy Bull","body":"<p>The Commonwealth Games ought to be prefaced with one of those warnings about outdated attitudes, like the kind Disney have attached to the beginning of its old movies. They could run it before the opening ceremony, right before they bring on Simon Le Bon. “These Games were predicated on the mistreatment of people and cultures.”</p> <p>The first were held in Hamilton in 1930, but have roots that go back beyond that into the Victorian era. In the official timeline, it was an Anglican clergyman called J Astley Cooper who first floated the idea for a “pan-Britannic festival of culture and sport” in a series of public letters published in 1891.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/23/can-radical-changes-restore-sagging-prestige-of-commonwealth-games\">Can radical changes restore sagging prestige of Commonwealth Games? | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cooper died a few months before the first Empire Games were held, but did such a good job of talking up his contribution that he’s gone down as their inventor, although a lot of the actual organising was done by the Canadian journalist and administrator Melville Marks Robinson. Cooper also claimed the credit for persuading Cecil Rhodes to establish his scholarships and for the Triangular Tournament of Test cricket contested by England, Australia and South Africa in 1912.</p> <p>The three men were all part of the same plan to foster “manly qualities” like “truth, courage, devotion to duty, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship” in the Dominions.</p> <p>“You have an object lesson of what is in my mind if one looks at cricket,” Cooper said in an interview published in the Observer in March 1929. “Unless you have been and lived among black people, as I have, you can have no idea of what a wonderful moral and disciplinary effect cricket has on the black races entrusted to our charge.” Maybe the organisers could use that quote in one of their big-screen montages too.</p> <p>There weren’t any African or Asian nations at the 1930 Games. India were invited, but preferred to go to the Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo. They made it to the second, but it was another 16 years before any black African athletes took part. The Games were supposed to be held in Johannesburg in 1934, but they were taken away and given to London after Canada raised concerns about the way their black athletes were likely to be treated in racially segregated South Africa. More than 70 years later, the Games still haven’t been held on the continent. This one would have been the first, if it had gone ahead in Durban as planned.</p> <p>The Games were going back and forth over apartheid through to its end. There were threatened boycotts in 1970, 1974, and 1982 and an actual one in 1978, when Nigeria stayed away in protest at New Zealand playing sport with South Africa. It got worse. After the Springboks toured New Zealand in 1981, Jamaica successfully proposed a new Commonwealth Code of Conduct that meant nations could be banned from competing in the Games if they violated the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement to withhold support for teams and sports from South Africa. Which didn’t stop the Rugby Football Union from sending England there on tour in 1984.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9498157a40771c4c6b0f1d7a04909f6a50ff374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9498157a40771c4c6b0f1d7a04909f6a50ff374/0_0_3633_2180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 13th Commonwealth Games opens in Edinburgh in 1986\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 13th Commonwealth Games opens in Edinburgh in 1986 without the 32 nations who boycotted the event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: S&amp;G/Barratts/Empics Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The English Commonwealth Games Council were supposed to write a letter of protest to the RFU. They refused to do it. Then they tried to rewrite the new Commonwealth Code of Conduct too, but failed. Somehow England still managed to end up competing at the Edinburgh Games in 1986, which 32 nations boycotted in protest.</p> <p>But then, the object of the Games had changed by the time they were founded. As the Observer explained back in 1930, they were largely about making us look good. “The British empire has been likened unto a family of nations: the mother country and her offspring scattered the world over … it is wise to maintain the idea of unity by careful cultivation, lest the attrition of time take effect.” They were, in the words of the historian Katharine Moore “a way to reconfirm and redefine” the empire. Through the 20th century they served to sportswash its reputation, a “friendly Games” between nations whose abiding connection is that they were all colonised by the same one.</p> <p>The Commonwealth Games Federation had no choice but to try to move on from all this in the last few years, as part of a wider effort to reinvent the Commonwealth. It is all about shared values now: “equality, humanity, destiny”. The website even mentions the “historical injustice” of the empire. Worthwhile as it is, the effect is inevitably a little watery, like listening to one of those royal speeches about the “profound sorrow” of slavery. In Birmingham, protesters have already described these as the “Plantation Games” in the local press.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the era of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, when people are tearing down statues of slave traders, when Barbados has become a republic and Jamaica is pressing the case for reparations for the slave trade, what’s the role of a Commonwealth Games that is sold on the promise that it is a celebration of common values with the nations we once exploited?

In an astonishingly active career spanning more than 60 years, she published nearly a dozen books unmatched by any of her contemporaries, which investigated and portrayed the long, complex culinary traditions of her adopted homeland.</p> <p>She was one of a group of women whose immersive technique, fine writing and red-hot enthusiasm delivered to us a vast range of new things to eat as well as introducing to our worldview new civilisations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/08/elizabeth-david-first-lady-of-food\" title=\"\">Elizabeth David</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/sep/19/claudia-roden-med-yotam-ottolenghi-jose-pizarro-sam-clark-recipes\" title=\"\">Claudia Roden</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/28/sam-clarke-moro-paula-wolfert\" title=\"\">Paula Wolfert</a> and Naomi Duguid are among them and they, and Kennedy, have often been described as anthropologists, something Kennedy usually denied, though ultimately accepted by dint of constant repetition.</p> <p>Although British by birth, she married, taught and published on the other side of the Atlantic. In Britain, her name was revered, but her impact relatively subdued. Her work relied on direct research, paying visits to cooks, surveying markets, gaining knowledge of the local produce and constant note-taking. The results were recipes that may, to the home cook, be alarming in their willingness to take things back to basics – not just using cornmeal, but soaking the kernel with lime overnight, removing the skins and grinding with lard to make corn dough (masa). Then again, the amateur may be daunted by the ingredients: anyone for iguana tamales, or brains with jalapeños? (And it may be useful to know how to gut the black iguana while about it.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92b6bb9a5504ef6fcb17486f12a974baa88afe89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92b6bb9a5504ef6fcb17486f12a974baa88afe89/0_95_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diana Kennedy shopping in Zitácuaro in 1990.

Education at South Hampstead high school, London, might have fitted her for further study but the second world war intervened. In 1941 she joined the Women’s Timber Corps, a division of the Land Army.</p> <p>Training at a secretarial college and later as a housing manager enabled her to find employment in Scottish mining estates after the war but in 1953 she emigrated to Canada where she held a variety of jobs, including running a film library and selling Wedgwood china. From Canada, she was able to travel to the west coast of America and the Caribbean.</p> <p>A diversion to Haiti in 1956, as she was on her way home for a holiday, coincided with civil unrest that was being covered by a New York Times journalist, Paul P Kennedy. They met and fell in love. They moved on immediately to Mexico, where he was based as Central American bureau chief, and married in 1957.</p> <p>Learning Spanish and working as a typist at the British Council in Mexico City, Diana was soon captivated by the foods and cookery of her new home. She would ask her maids, or maids of friends, about a dish and was always told that this was how they did it in their village. So she would then hightail it to the source, always the source, and receive instruction directly. Thus was established her unfailing method – inquiry, location, travel, interrogation. All her recipes acknowledged their progenitors, all her methods were, so far as it might be feasible, authentic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/07/thomasina-miers-on-diana-kennedy-mexican-recipes-books\">Mexican icon: how Diana Kennedy changed how we cook | The cook’s cook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1966 the Kennedys were forced to move to New York due to Paul’s need for cancer treatment. This was not successful and he died a year later, leaving Diana somewhat adrift in an alien city. She was fortunate to have met the New York Times food editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/08/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Craig Claiborne</a> when he had earlier visited them in Mexico. He not only featured her work on Mexican cookery but also suggested she start teaching small classes gathered in her apartment galley kitchen. As word got out, it was heeded by an editor at the publishers Harper &amp; Row, Frances McCullough, who persuaded Kennedy to write her first book, The Cuisines of Mexico, published in 1972, which became a bestseller.</p> <p>The recipes were established by repeated voyages round the Mexican countryside, by bus, train, later by her own campervan (sometimes with a pistol in the glove compartment), and after an initial struggle with the art of writing. But Kennedy’s professional life was centred on the burgeoning cookery schools of America, where she was in constant demand. She moved permanently to Mexico only in 1976. Come 1980, she purchased a few acres near the city of Zitácuaro, 100 miles due west of Mexico City, where she planted myriad trees, set up a smallholding of pigs, goats, chickens and very fierce dogs, built what might be termed an eco-house, largely off-grid, and set about establishing <a href=\"http://www.dianakennedycenter.org/\" title=\"\">a centre</a> of research, teaching and sustainable living.</p> <p>Her books appeared with impressive regularity: The Tortilla Book in 1975; Recipes from the Regional Cooks of Mexico in 1978; Nothing Fancy, which was a diversion to slight memoir and scrapbook of favourite recipes from all over, in 1984; The Art of Mexican Cooking in 1989; My Mexico in 1998; From My Mexican Kitchen – Techniques and Ingredients in 2003; and finally – and perhaps the most impressive of all – Oaxaca al Gusto: An Infinite Gastronomy in 2010.</p> <p>Kennedy will be remembered for her forthrightness, and her criticism of faulty ingredients, shortcuts and plagiarism of her work. But her enthusiasm and fervent insistence on the right way to do things had an immense and beneficial influence, not least on chefs in Mexico and North America who were trying to produce good Mexican food. Her contribution was recognised in the US by the James Beard Foundation, in Mexico by her admission to the Order of the Aztec Eagle in 1981, and in Britain by her appointment as MBE, with the award made to her in person by Prince Charles at a lunch in her home in 2002.</p> <p> • Diana Kennedy, food writer, born 3 March 1923; died 24 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/27/i-should-have-scored-with-my-first-shot-russo-says-backheel-born-of-frustration","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T16:02:21Z","webTitle":"‘Home is where the heart is’: Leah Williamson insists England are focused","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/i-should-have-scored-with-my-first-shot-russo-says-backheel-born-of-frustration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/27/i-should-have-scored-with-my-first-shot-russo-says-backheel-born-of-frustration","fields":{"headline":"‘Home is where the heart is’: Leah Williamson insists England are focused","trailText":"Leah Williamson said England ‘must do their job on the pitch’ in Sunday’s final after the dramatic 4-0 semi-final victory over Sweden","byline":"Suzanne Wrack","body":"<p>Leah Williamson says England’s focus is on completing their task after the Euro 2022 hosts secured a place in Sunday’s final.

That’s the most powerful thing, the biggest way we can contribute, and that is what we are focusing on.</p> <p>“I know I have a job to do, but who says I can’t enjoy those moments and the team can’t enjoy those moments? That’s what I hope, that we are giving off that vibe. It’s genuine and the crowd can enjoy that with us. I hope that the crowd at Wembley is going to have as good a time as we are going to have, because I promise you, we will enjoy it.</p> <p>“We’ve got some preparation to do, we don’t even know who we are playing yet. But for me, to walk out on to that pitch was an incredible feeling and I can imagine at the weekend that will be incredible as well.</p> <p>“I’ve got a scarf around my neck which says: ‘Home is where the heart is’ and to have our families on this journey, to walk out at Wembley, I think that is something we really have to take in. I want to appreciate it for what it is, but I have got a job to do and that’ll be the most important thing.”</p> <p>In a semi-final full of notable performances, Williamson singled out goalkeeper Mary Earps, who pulled off an important save after 20 seconds and another with the Lionesses 2-0 up.</p> <p>“Mary made a save at a key moment of the game – which was an incredible turning point for us,” Williamson said of the latter save. “We then went up the other end and scored. That’s when you talk about a team, that’s what the team is about because at opposite ends of the pitch everybody is making it count.</p> <p>“That moment deserves a shoutout.

I should have scored in the first place, so I just swung a foot at it and luckily it hit the back of the net.”</p> <p>Russo was well aware of the goal’s – England’s third – significance. “To score in a semi-final and progress to the final is a huge highlight of my career. I don’t normally score backheels and I don’t think you’ll see one again,” she said.</p> <p>The importance of her goal was not lost on a global audience watching the game. The former USA World Cup winner Abby Wambach, who scored 184 goals in 255 games said: “I dreamt of scoring a goal like that my whole life. Never happened. Alessia Russo take a bow. Go on England.”</p> <p>The Australia and Chelsea forward Sam Kerr, who won the golden boot in the WSL last season, said: “Not gonna lie, that was lit from Russo.”</p> <p>Russo has shone in the role as a late substitute, scoring four times in England’s five games but is not bothered with being labelled a supersub. “I’ll take any time I get to play for England,” she said. “It’s been amazing. If that’s the role, I’ll take it for sure. Ellen [White] does a great job at wearing everyone out, as does the whole team, we’re up there in terms of physicality right now. Whenever the chance is there, I’ll take it.”</p> <p>That Russo even attempted the backheel reflects her confidence in her current form. “When you’re enjoying your football you play your best,” she added.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"the-whole-picture/2022/jul/27/tracking-a-firms-carbon-footprint-the-digital-tools-that-can-capture-vital-insights-for-business","type":"article","sectionId":"the-whole-picture","sectionName":"The whole picture","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T16:00:53Z","webTitle":"Tracking a firm’s carbon footprint: the digital tools that can capture vital insights for business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/the-whole-picture/2022/jul/27/tracking-a-firms-carbon-footprint-the-digital-tools-that-can-capture-vital-insights-for-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/the-whole-picture/2022/jul/27/tracking-a-firms-carbon-footprint-the-digital-tools-that-can-capture-vital-insights-for-business","fields":{"headline":"Tracking a firm’s carbon footprint: the digital tools that can capture vital insights for business","trailText":"Being able to back up sustainability claims is vital for businesses. That’s where accurate data comes in …","byline":"Helena Pozniak","body":"<p>Every business wants to talk about “sustainability”. Mentions of the S-word in corporate reports have increased by 44% since 2018, <a href=\"https://www.alpha-sense.com/blog/esg-trends-and-c-suite-sentiment-in-2021/\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to research</a> on top business trends for 2021 undertaken by the software firm SAP and market researchers at AlphaSense.</p> <p>But, as consumers and businesses alike have come to realise, sustainability can be a slippery concept. Definitions vary, benchmarks differ and data is patchy. All too often, that results in a gap between what companies say and what they do.</p> <p>Meanwhile, today’s ethically minded consumers have become more exacting. Many want to know more than simply where their goods come from: they also want to know a product’s carbon emissions across its entire production chain, whether it can be recycled, and whether the workplaces where it was made embrace fair labour practices. Customers have also grown savvier at spotting false claims, while activists and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/dirty-greenwashing-watchdog-targets-fashion-brands-over-misleading-claims\">regulators</a> are getting ever more adept at calling out companies for failing to back up their sustainability claims and targets with actions.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, it is increasingly critical for businesses to be able to demonstrate the veracity of their sustainability claims. Likewise, it’s crucial that they can accurately measure and monitor their performance against their own targets. But this can be a difficult undertaking. Most companies’ total carbon emissions come from their products’ supply chains rather than from the companies’ directly-owned operations, which makes them difficult to track. For instance, these could include emissions associated with raw materials, and delivery and logistics. Accounting for these value chain emissions – otherwise known as Scope 3 emissions – is essential for any meaningful sustainability claims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6a941d2f90bdaa84ae74141165f88b2164915c89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a941d2f90bdaa84ae74141165f88b2164915c89/0_231_1155_1442/801.jpg\" alt=\"Woman with long blond hair dressed with jeans and a white cardigan, sitting on a large stack of used clothes while looking at camera in a fabrics recycling factory.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Digital tools help track the life cycles of products, from materials to recycling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giorgio Magini/Stocksy United</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Calculating environmental and social impacts across a company’s products and services, and across the entirety of their life cycles is simply – complicated,” explains Thomas Saueressig, a SAP executive responsible for product engineering, in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-solutions-future-has-already-arrived-thomas-saueressig/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog post</a>. “Yet supply chain emissions are on average <a href=\"https://www.cdp.net/en/research/global-reports/transparency-to-transformation\" rel=\"nofollow\">11.4 times higher</a> than operational emissions. So merely focusing on individual operational emissions is no longer enough. Actually, it was always just a first step.”</p> <p>After all, efforts to tackle complex global problems such as the climate emergency and other social injustices are necessarily collective efforts, so it stands to reason that joint initiatives and policies will be more impactful.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://insidesap.com/sap-reports-corporate-sustainability-gaps-and-opportunities/\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> from SAP and the consultancy Oxford Economics found that more than half of 2,000 executives surveyed had enforceable joint sustainability policies in place with a vendor or supplier. Nearly a third said the success of their own company’s sustainability initiatives relied on those relationships.</p> <p>However, the report found much room for improvement when it came to the quality of those relationships: “Too often the connection between outside practices and internal goals is not strong enough. Just 16% have well-established policies for working sustainably with vendors and suppliers.”</p> <p>One of the key ways to make joint efforts more effective is to gather better data, for instance on each business’s carbon emissions and recycling practices. As the old business adage goes, what gets measured gets managed.</p> <p>However, gathering robust and comparable data can be challenging in the context of complex supply chains. The research found that more than half of respondents reported that insufficient data management and analysis skills in their organisation made it difficult to achieve sustainability. Also, 55% found it difficult to manage separate processes for in-house and external software; and 55% had difficulty sharing data between different kinds of software.</p> <p>Given the complexity and the need for transparency, traceability, real-time monitoring and verification, perhaps it’s no surprise that businesses are turning to cutting-edge technology to help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7fd060348fbb70b00bc27d5e327c09f7aabec92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7fd060348fbb70b00bc27d5e327c09f7aabec92/0_142_2120_1272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Using tablet to review factory report with blurred background of warehouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The latest tech can help businesses track their progress with sustainability metrics from end-to-end.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>SAP produces several digital tools and solutions to help companies gather, consolidate and analyse data.

By the 48th minute she had a goal and an assist, though, and it was hard to tell she was playing through pain.</p> <p>“Everyone keeps saying that but I don’t feel like I did a couple of years ago,” said the 2020 Fifa Best player of the year. “The Lucy Bronze of a couple of years ago was ‘the best player in the world’. I’m still happy to be contributing to the team, still playing good football, obviously getting an assist for Beth [Mead] and getting her up there to get the Golden Boot. It would be nice to be part of her little individual journey.</p> <p>“It’s been difficult to come back from a knee injury which has lingered for a very long time and still is now. The goals and assists are not something I consider a major part of my game. I’d much rather the likes of Beth and Ellen [White] and Hempo [Lauren Hemp] get on the scoresheet. I enjoyed it, though. I’d not scored in a Euros.”</p> <p>In the first half, with England feeling the heat, Bronze could be seen exchanging hurried words with Sarina Wiegman on the touchline.

I think she said herself that the Spanish performance was one of the best she’d ever seen – to come through that was amazing, not just for the team but for her as a manager and coach.”</p> <p>That practical information was “small details she wants to change”, Bronze said. “A lot of that is her assistant Arjan [Veurink], who she also brought from the Dutch team. I think they must not like us very much because we brought two of their best coaches. Sarina gets the headlines but Arjan’s a tactical genius as well. They’re both very calm, very focused with the information they gave us, and I think that shows in the way that we play.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2022/06/euros-players/embed/England/2/player.html\" data-alt=\"Lucy Bronze\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2022/06/euros-players/embed/England/2/player.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Calmness has been key.

She’s very excited, but once the game’s done we’re on to the next game.

Over lunch just off Whitehall in the early 1990s, I asked Trimble, in those days the embodiment of a hardline backbench Ulster Unionist MP, if he ever spent time in the Irish Republic. With a grin, he replied that he had just recently been in Dublin for a performance of Leoš Janáček’s Kát’a Kabanová, a work he greatly admired. We spent the rest of the lunch talking about opera as well as politics. It was clear that this was a unionist politician who was worth knowing.</p> <p>And so it proved over many years, in conversations of every kind. Trimble, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/26/lord-trimble-obituary\">who died this week</a>, was smart, approachable, sometimes sharp, but above all an immensely practical politician. He came from a relatively liberal unionist family background in County Down, but he always knew he had to carry his ardently loyalist base in his Upper Bann constituency along any new path that he advocated or that events required. He was one of those politicians who think around corners, not in straight lines, the best sort.</p> <p>Politics for Trimble was certainly about defending strong unionist interests. That thread unites the implacable role he played in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/14/johnmullin\">Drumcree confrontations</a> of 1995 with his more supple approach towards talking to republicans in the years that followed, as well as his bleak and mistaken support for Brexit. But those politics were also about adjusting to and helping to shape change in Northern Ireland. During the key decade starting in 1995, when he became UUP leader, until 2005, when his party was crushed by Ian Paisley’s DUP, he often proved pretty good at it, above all when he delivered a unionist majority for the power-sharing Good Friday agreement that he signed in 1998.</p> <p>A quarter of a century on, it is easy to take for granted what Trimble, along with many others, achieved back then. It is extremely important not to do that. The Northern Ireland in which Trimble lived the first half of his adult life was the grimmest, most unjust and violent place in western Europe. Money, hope and trust were in very short supply. The Northern Ireland that Trimble helped create after 1998 may indeed be very far from perfect, but economically, politically and culturally it is another world. In the words of his biographer Dean Godson this week, this is why Trimble mattered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/legacy-endure-tributes-paid-david-trimble-northern-ireland\">‘His legacy will endure’: tributes paid to David Trimble</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trimble was never the stereotypical parochial Ulster politician and he was always interested in the bigger picture. He once berated Steve Bell for always depicting him in a bowler hat, an item of Orange iconography he indignantly denied ever possessing. With his wide cultural hinterland, he thought of himself, and Northern Ireland unionism, as players on a British and sometimes even an international stage. Although borders loomed extremely large in his political career, he proved in the end to have surprisingly few mental barriers of his own.</p> <p>This is partly why, as a unionist in practice as well as in theory, when he lost his Westminster seat, he gravitated more towards Britain, becoming a Conservative peer and spending some of his downtime piloting his narrowboat through the canals of England. When the Tory conference was in Birmingham, the Trimbles would moor in the Gas Street basin. He sometimes moored right by the Guardian’s offices in London, and the last time we met was when I bumped into David and his wife, Daphne, drinking white wine in a canalside garden there.</p> <p>Yet if Trimble mattered – which he did – his way of doing politics was the key. And that approach should not be allowed to perish with him. This brings us to the great irony of his later career. Just when Trimble, the Ulster Unionist with the hinterland who thought around corners, decided to become a Tory to emphasise, in part, his break with the fundamentalist and zero-sum politics of Northern Ireland, so, at the same time, the Tory party made the opposite break with its own more pragmatic past and began to embrace a fundamentalism of its own, making it more than ever like a British version of the DUP.</p> <p>So, when Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss began their first debate on Monday by each praising Trimble as a political giant, do not be taken in. Neither Sunak nor Truss is a Tory in the sense that Trimble understood it. Neither of them shows any inkling of being interested in Northern Ireland, in the mishandling of the Brexit process there, or the wider dangers that threaten the UK’s union. These are not the only subjects that have been almost totally ignored in the leadership race – not least by most of the press, which was never even remotely interested in Northern Ireland anyway – but they are certainly among the most important.</p> <p>There was much to disagree with in Trimble’s politics. He got a lot of things wrong, though he got the one big thing right. But when Trimble adopted a hard political line, or behaved unreasonably, it was almost invariably as a means to an eventual compromise end, not as an end in itself. Particularly in Truss’s case, and increasingly in Sunak’s, the hardline attitude is all that there is. Truss does not want to override the Northern Ireland protocol because she cares about Northern Ireland’s future but because she does not. Whatever you may think about him, you could never say that about David Trimble.</p> <ul> <li><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian associate editor and columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/27/double-digit-price-hikes-help-heinz-and-reckitt-deliver-sales-jump","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T15:48:24Z","webTitle":"Double-digit price hikes help Heinz and Reckitt post jump in value sales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/double-digit-price-hikes-help-heinz-and-reckitt-deliver-sales-jump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/27/double-digit-price-hikes-help-heinz-and-reckitt-deliver-sales-jump","fields":{"headline":"Double-digit price hikes help Heinz and Reckitt deliver sales jump","trailText":"Dettol maker says customers willing to accept increases on branded items, and that further rises on the way","byline":"Sarah Butler","body":"<p>The ketchup and baked beans group Kraft Heinz and Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Dettol, Nurofen and Strepsils, have both revealed they hiked prices by double digits in the spring and that this helped to drive better-than-expected sales.</p> <p>Heinz said prices rose by 12.4% in the three months to 26 June, helping it deliver a 10% rise in sales despite a 2.3% drop in the number of items sold.</p> <p>The US-based food group which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/08/heinz-tesco-price-rises-ketchup-baked-beans-soup\">paused deliveries to the UK’s biggest supermarket, Tesco</a>, this spring in a battle over price rises, said the inflation was “primarily driven by price increases to mitigate rising input costs”.</p> <p>Sales are now expected to increase by more than 7% this year compared with about 5% previously anticipated.

It was the only dessert with as much real beef as Taco Bell,” Colbert quipped. “And may I point out, we learned this shocking news on a Taco Tuesday.

Because that’s proof that they knew their crime was a crime while they crimed it.”</p> <p>In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/us/politics/trump-fake-electors-emails.html\">New York Times obtained emails</a> from the plotters of the fake electors scheme, in which they repeatedly used the word “fake” to refer to the so-called electors. “That’s just straight-up saying it!” Colbert marveled. “You’re plotting the biggest crime in American history, you might want to use some code words.”</p> <p>In a follow-up email, Phoenix-based lawyer Jack Wilenchik, who worked with the Trump campaign, wrote: “‘alternative’ votes is probably a better term than ‘fake’ votes” along with a smiley face emoji. “He realized he incriminated himself in an email, then he admitted it in the next email,” Colbert noted. “Shrug emoji, poop emoji, 4, brain emoji.”</p> <p>Another of the plotters referred to the Trump lawyer Cleta Mitchell as “Clita” and “Clavita” — “that’s a surprise, most Republican men can’t find the Clavita”, Colbert joked.</p> <h2><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1552119081561575424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Russia is pulling out of the International Space Station, when all we asked them to do was pull out of Ukraine.

Is this is a Google Translate issue? What’s going on here?”</p> <p>The decision, effective after 2024, is “actually bad news”, Noah continued, “because Russia helps to operate the space station”. Noah was surprised by this fact – “am I the only who’s shocked by how many things are connected to Russia in the world?” he wondered. “Like the world’s energy supply, Africa’s food supply, space travel, minerals for our electronics. Soon we’re going to find out that Russia provides the sound for sneezes and without them, we can’t complete the action.</p> <p>“Although they think this is pretty cool,” he concluded, “good luck to them making a dramatic exit when there’s zero gravity.”</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqoX-9pE7M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qdqoX-9pE7M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And on Late Night, Seth Meyers started with Joe Biden’s comment that he doesn’t think the US is entering a recession, “God willing.” “All right, well, ‘God willing’ kinda undercuts the first part,” Meyers said. “That’s like saying, ‘Of course I’m good to drive!

A few Olympic opening-ceremony nods to the NHS – <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4As0e4de-rI?t=2739\">naturally, featuring more than one patient to a bed</a> – and suddenly, austerity and the hostile environment disappeared, structural racism, sexism and classism vanishing with them. In a surge of collective ecstasy, the nation came together as one, sharing a memorable fortnight of peace, love and unity. And though ticket-pricing made the actual competition inaccessible to almost everyone, happily, the post-Games era of unaffordable homes, worsening poverty and an ailing healthcare system is far more democratic.</p> \n<p>Consequently, it was no great surprise to see David Cameron emerge from post-Brexit hiding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/1552203905437777920)\">to trumpet himself on social media disgrace Twitter</a> – and Boris Johnson was there too, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1552034740013875202\">congratulating England’s women on their brilliant thrashing of Sweden</a>. These two missives, apparently unrelated, are in fact connected because both feature failed leaders seeking to harness the joy of sport while, at the same time, inadvertently misdirecting from policy disasters that are its precise antithesis: Cameron’s Brexit referendum legitimised and exacerbated racial tensions and economic inequality; Johnson has repeatedly advocated for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/women-bearing-86-of-austerity-burden-labour-research-reveals\">laws that harm women in disproportionate manner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/08/tories-urged-not-to-betray-working-women-by-ditching-employment-bill\">his government has binned promises to clamp down on sexual harassment and workplace misogyny in its flagship employment bill</a>. Consequently, the response of Liz Truss, minister for women and equalities, is far more telling, so for the benefit of the uninitiated, here it is, in full:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcab7aef5534734970810c5cf4cd19bea41e1b12\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcab7aef5534734970810c5cf4cd19bea41e1b12/0_137_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cue the Fiver’s favourite tumbleweed image.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cue the Fiver’s favourite tumbleweed image.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vstock/Getty Images/Tetra images RF</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All of which is to say that, although the point of football is simple pleasure, its lessons of teamwork, equality and love must not be ignored. Enjoying Sarina Wiegman’s brilliant team is incumbent upon us all, but if we cannot harness their inspiration to make a better world, then we probably studied PPE at Oxford.</p> \n<p>But the Lionesses are not finished yet, the hilarious yet soul-crushing manner of their final defeat still to be determined. Their opponents on Sunday will be either “the French” or “the Germans”, both of whom are well-equipped to take the title and whose semi-final this evening promises to be a jazzer. In classic, time-honoured style, France’s manager began the competition by falling out with some of her better players, and though her team started the competition in tremendous form, they’ve been less impressive since losing Marie-Antoinette Katoto to an ACL injury. Germany, meanwhile, are an extremely capable outfit: dangerous in attack, yet to concede a goal in the tournament, and champions in eight of the last 12 editions. Or, put another way, The Fiver has no idea what’s going to happen next – but is certain that at some point, a dubious politician will attempt to make capital from it.</p> \n<h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Sarah Rendell at 8pm BST for minute-by-minute coverage of Germany 3-2 France in the Euro 2022 semi-final.</a></p> \n<h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> \n<p>“This is the most proud I’ve been of any England team ever.

Why? Because the process of maintaining technical devices is made extremely difficult by the sanctions adopted by Europe,” Dmitry Peskov said.</p> <p>“Gazprom was and remains a reliable guarantor of its obligations ... but it can’t guarantee the pumping of gas if the imported devices cannot be maintained because of European sanctions.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, the operator Eugas announced a booking of extra capacity for its Transgas pipeline via Slovakia and Ukraine, raising hopes in Germany that Gazprom was looking to make up for lower deliveries by pumping gas via a different route.</p> <p>However, on Wednesday no increased deliveries via Transgas were reported.</p> <p>“Transgas has plenty of spare capacity,” said Andreas Schröder, an energy expert for the market analyst ICIS. “If Russia really wanted to deliver its gas to Europe it could easily reroute via Slovakia. However, that would also entail paying higher transit fees to Ukraine.”</p> <p>Deliveries of Russian gas through the Yamal pipeline, which passes through Belarus and Poland, ceased in May due to sanctions.</p> <p>On Tuesday, energy ministers from all of the European Union’s 27 member states except Hungary backed a voluntary 15% reduction in gas usage over the winter, a target that could become mandatory if the Kremlin ordered a complete shutdown of gas to Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ministers agreed opt-outs for island nations and possible exclusions for countries little connected to the European gas network, which will blunt the overall effect in the event of a full-blown gas crisis.

He said it was unrealistic to expect Nord Stream 1 to resume delivering at 40% of capacity.</p> <p>Müller said Germany had already started to make significant savings, in part due to warm temperatures in the spring and summer. Private households and industry consumed “five, six, seven per cent less gas” than usual.</p> <p>However, Müller warned of difficult months ahead. “In the autumn the situation will change, gas consumption will rise,” he said, noting the country’s strong reliance on gas for its heating.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/27/man-dies-after-fight-at-california-soccer-game-over-refereeing-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T15:06:51Z","webTitle":"Man dies after fight at California soccer game over refereeing decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/man-dies-after-fight-at-california-soccer-game-over-refereeing-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/27/man-dies-after-fight-at-california-soccer-game-over-refereeing-decision","fields":{"headline":"Man dies after fight at California soccer game over refereeing decision","trailText":"A 29-year-old man has died 15 days days after he was involved in a fight between two soccer teams in southern California","byline":"Guardian sport","body":"<p>A 29-year-old man has died 15 days days after he was involved in a fight between two amateur soccer teams in southern California.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.oxnardpd.org/news-release-update-hospitalized-soccer-player-dies-police-still-searching-for-witnesses-or-video-of-incident/\">Police confirmed</a> that Misael Sanchez died on Monday morning, two weeks after he became involved in the fight at a high school in Oxnard, a city in the greater Los Angeles area.

You may remember the picture: the charred remains of the joey’s arms wrapped around the fence, its head poking through a gap, clenched teeth standing out pale white against the grey body and post-apocalyptic backdrop.</p> <p>The photo went viral, spreading like wildfire through people’s devices and into their nervous systems, causing them anxiety and distress about an event a world away. In my child psychotherapy practice, I’m seeing ever more children struggling to manage their feelings in the wake of viral news events, such as the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">George Floyd</a> in the US, the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/03/sarah-everard-murder-government-ad-campaign-male-violence-abuse\">Sarah Everard</a> in the UK, school shootings, some of the shocking images around climate breakdown, and now a war.</p> <p>Horrific, violent and apocalyptic scenarios are nothing new to the human species, but they seem especially concrete and immediate to us today. We can see and feel that the Earth is heating up. The recent images of wildfires raging across southern Europe (and wildfires even in London) need little interpretation. We also have this thing called the internet, which binds our nervous system to the nervous systems of the other eight billion people on our planet. Proximity to a disaster is no longer a solid predictor of psychological impact. The authors of a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/disaster-news-on-tv-and-social-media-can-trigger-post-traumatic-stress-in-kids-thousands-of-miles-away-heres-why-some-are-more-vulnerable-173627\">neuroscience study on post-traumatic stress</a> said that they found “the flood of images on TV and social media can have a powerful psychological impact on children – whether those children are physically in the line of danger or watching from thousands of miles away”.</p> <p>How can we speak to our children about such uncomfortable truths while helping them to stay grounded? The place to start, of course, is with ourselves. Children need congruence from the grownups around them. Like the red-faced, stressed-out teacher who shouts at the children in their class to “calm down!”, it doesn’t work when we try to impose on our children a quality we haven’t accessed<strong> </strong>within ourselves.</p> <p>The first and most obvious step is to unplug. There is a part of us that compulsively consumes bad news. It helps just to acknowledge that there is a part of you that is addicted to the stress and drama of world events, which believes that if you can stay right on top of the news you can keep you and your family safe. Then you can remind yourself (with kindness) that you aren’t helping anyone, and definitely not helping your kids, by constantly consuming disaster news.</p> <p>Once we are more frequently unplugged we can make a space to process the difficult and uncomfortable feelings that come up around these issues. As the world continues to heat up, our children really need us to develop this capacity to be with uncomfortable truths. After all, as the African American writer and activist James Baldwin wrote: “One can only face in others what one can face in oneself … This energy is all that one finds in the rubble of vanished civilizations, and the only hope for ours.”</p> <p>What makes a truth “uncomfortable”? It’s not the bare facts of the story, but the feelings associated with those facts that we find uncomfortable – often the grief, the shame, the loneliness, the terror. As grownups, when we haven’t learned to bear these feelings we can project them on to our kids. We may worry that if they see us crying or looking terrified they will crumble. So we come up with comforting lies. We tell them everything is going to be OK.</p> <p>But our kids detect such incongruence. Whether they read the news or not, they are sensitive to the world around them. One of the primary ways a human being assesses whether we are safe is via other people, especially their faces and voices. I recently spoke to a<strong> </strong>woman who grew up in Baghdad during the first Gulf war. She told me that the biggest trauma for her was not related to personal safety or fear of bombs – it was seeing the fear on her parent’s faces while they tried to reassure her that everything was fine.</p> <p>A simple practice to deal with uncomfortable truths is to think about an issue in the world that feels uncomfortable for you, gently bring your attention into your body and find the place where the uncomfortable feeling beneath this truth is most alive. Put a nurturing hand on that place, let the feeling know it’s OK for it to be there. This can bring a surprising sense of peace. I have also found this mantra to be very important and effective in this mad, threat-signalling world: “In this moment, I am safe.”</p> <p>You can use the same practice with your children, but it only works if you have practised it yourself first. In my experience, children are much better at handling uncomfortable truths than we give them credit for. Trust your child’s capacity a little bit more. Normalise and validate what they are feeling. Let them ask as many questions as they need to. Don’t sugarcoat the answers. And it’s OK to say: “I don’t know.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/10/evidence-grows-lockdown-harm-to-young-but-we-act-as-if-nothing-happened\">Evidence grows of lockdown harm to the young. But we act as if nothing happened | Martha Gill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, what we tell our children should depend on their age and the situation. I wouldn’t want my four-year-old daughter to know the gruesome details of a school shooting. But I do talk to her openly in a language she can understand about death, the climate crisis and the war in Ukraine. I keep the conversations focused on the feelings: “It feels really sad to me that people die in a war.” I want to help the child to express their own feelings about the situation. It’s important they know that you have feelings about this situation too, and<em><strong> </strong></em>that these feelings are normal and bearable. They give us vital information about the world. We underestimate how much children take their cues from us on what is OK and not OK, what is safe to express and not express.</p> <p>If your child is of an age where they are more online, on social media, and more exposed to viral news events, then it becomes vital that you help them – and yourself – to unplug from the digital nervous system. We need time and space to process all the suffering going on in the world. We also need to bring balance by actively looking for the good – not dramatic, save-the-world type of actions, but small moments like someone holding the door open, or thanking the bus driver, or a smile from a passerby. We don’t want to live in denial about the tragedies of this world, but we also don’t want our kids to drown in them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Louis Weinstock is a child and family psychotherapist, the co-founder of the charity <a href=\"https://www.apartofme.app/about\">Apart of Me</a>, and the author of the book <a href=\"https://louisweinstock.com/how-the-world-is-making-our-children-mad-and-what-to-do-about-it/\">How The World Is Making Our Children Mad And What To Do About It</a></p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Several shadow ministers who joined picket lines during the last strike did not lose their jobs, despite the warning.</p> <p>Tarry, a former officer of the TSSA trade union who helped run Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaign, has not previously joined the picket lines as a shadow minister, though he tweeted a picture of himself alongside workers on an earlier strike day.</p> <p>Ruth Jones, a shadow environment minister, has also posted pictures supporting the strike. One shadow cabinet source said they believed Starmer’s position on picket lines would become unsustainable as the number of disputes intensified – with potential strikes planned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/19/royal-mail-staff-vote-strike-pay-dispute-cwu\">postal workers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/18/strike-chaoes-teachers-nhs-staff-action-pay-rail-unions\">NHS staff and teachers</a>.</p> <p>“There will be other frontbenchers who will want to support striking workers in their constituencies,” they said.</p> <p>Tarry told ITV News it was not his intention to defy Starmer and said the disputes would not be happening under a Labour government. “I’m here supporting these striking workers because it’s important we get a pay deal and get to resolve as soon as possible so the travelling public can get back to work,” he said.</p> <p>“The reality is this is about a failing government, this is about dispute happening all across the country. We’ve got potentially doctors, nurses and communication workers.”</p> <p>Tarry said: “No one said anything to me about whether or not I should be on a picket line today.”</p> <p>A Labour source said the advice from party whips not to join picket lines had not been reissued since the first strikes but was still party policy.</p> <p>Asked whether he expected to be sacked, Tarry said: “If Labour were in power and I was secretary of state for transport this dispute would not be happening.”</p> <p>Other shadow ministers have not been sacked for attending picket lines, though Tarry is the first to do multiple broadcast interviews from the strikes.</p> <p>Senior Labour sources said they were sceptical of Tarry’s motives and linked it to his reselection battle in Ilford South. Wards in Tarry’s constituency voted unanimously for a full reselection – meaning he is likely to lose the seat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>They suggested Tarry was in effect daring Starmer to sack him. One said: “He didn’t go to the first picket but has turned up now. So what has changed?”</p> <p>Tarry said after the interviews that he remained on the side of the striking rail workers, tweeting a photo that said he was “on the side of the members not the establishment”. He has previously written to Labour’s general secretary, David Evans, suggesting he had seen evidence of voting irregularity in his selection battle.</p> <p>Tarry won selection in the east London seat in 2019 after the local council leader, Jas Athwal, was suspended from the party in the run-up to the vote, over allegations of inappropriate behaviour.

It’s been a pretty compelling race so far and though we may not be that surprised to find Marianne Vos in the yellow jersey, she’s had to work hard for it, and she was thrillingly overhauled yesterday by Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig, the Danish rider recovering brilliantly from her stage two horror show.</p> <p>Ludwig should be reasonably well suited to today’s stage too, which is a demanding one, featuring gravel sectors and five categorised climbs before a fast descent into the winding streets of Bar-sur-Aube at the finish. Vos will be expected to hold on to her overall lead but Canyon-SRAM’s Kasia Niewiadoma, who’s third in the GC standings, and the Paris-Roubaix winner Elisa Longo Borghini might also be in the mix.</p> <p>The riders roll off around 12pm BST/1pm CET.

The second required engines being switched off.</p> <p>“I think as a precaution, for obvious safety reasons, we will be recommending the procedure is changed and the engines are turned off,” he added, saying the state-run organisation would be sending the results of its own investigation not only to the Greek government but also to the UK Civil Aviation Authority.</p> <p>Fenton, 22, was killed instantly when he was struck by the tail rotor of a Bell 407 helicopter that, at the end of a birthday celebration holiday, had brought him and a group of friends from Mykonos. The privately chartered aircraft, part of a fleet operated by the Megara-based company Superior Air, had only minutes earlier landed at the Lolos helipad close to Athens international airport.</p> <p>Spinning at up to 500 rotations a second, the propeller would have been virtually invisible, experts say.</p> <p>Greek police initially suggested the incident had occurred when the Oxford Brookes student, defying regulations, had attempted to take a selfie after safely disembarking. Local media reported Fenton had been running back towards the aircraft’s tail with his mobile phone in hand as horrified onlookers shouted at him to stop.</p> <p> But a schoolfriend travelling with Fenton has reportedly denied that version of events, claiming they had neither been escorted to the helipad’s terminus nor given any instructions as they exited the aircraft.</p> <p>“All they did was open the doors for us,” Jack Stanton-Gleaves was quoted as telling Mail Online. “We disembarked on our own and no one stopped Jack from going to the rear of the helicopter.”</p> <p>The aircraft’s pilot and two ground engineers were briefly arrested but were released pending the results of an emergency inquiry ordered by a Greek public prosecutor. All could face charges of involuntary manslaughter if alleged to have been negligent. </p> <p>Kondylis conceded ongoing investigations would ultimately hinge on witness testimony and any other factual information because, unlike planes, helicopters did not have flight data and cockpit voice recorders.</p> <p>“We cannot just accept what they say,” he said, referring to Superior Air. “They have to show proof. We are waiting for evidence of their written procedures and their airways’ manual. I have learned that there were five other passengers waiting in the [airstrip] terminus [to board helicopters] and they will have seen what happened. Their evidence will be very important. Perhaps one of them took a video, factual information that cannot be denied.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/jul/27/dettol-nurofen-reckitt-prices-us-formula-gas-inflation-markets-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T14:38:09Z","webTitle":"Cost of living: McDonald’s, Kraft Heinz and Reckitt raise prices, as gas soars – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jul/27/dettol-nurofen-reckitt-prices-us-formula-gas-inflation-markets-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/jul/27/dettol-nurofen-reckitt-prices-us-formula-gas-inflation-markets-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Cost of living: McDonald’s, Kraft Heinz and Reckitt raise prices, as gas soars – as it happened","trailText":"End of the 99p cheeseburger as fast food chain warns ‘we’re living through incredibly challenging times’","byline":"Graeme Wearden","body":"<div id=\"block-62e13cdd8f08127940906637\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T14:38:02.189Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time to recap....</p> <p><strong>Consumer-focused companies have been raising their prices sharply, concluding that customers will keep stumping up for their wares despite the cost of living squeeze.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jul/27/dettol-nurofen-reckitt-prices-us-formula-gas-inflation-markets-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-62e0f9468f081279409062d9#block-62e0f9468f081279409062d9\">McDonalds made the most eye-catching move</a>, lifting the price of the popular cheeseburger over the £1 mark - in a 20% hike from 99p to £1.19.</p> <p>The fast food chain pointed out that this super-size increase was the first in 14 years, as it bowed to pressures from higher input costs such as food and energy. </p> <p>But other products are going up by 10p to 20p each, which will put more strain on customers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/mcdonalds-uk-raises-price-of-cheeseburger-for-first-time-in-14-years\">McDonald’s UK raises price of cheeseburger for first time in 14 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong>, the firm behind health and hygiene brands from Durex to Dettol, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jul/27/dettol-nurofen-reckitt-prices-us-formula-gas-inflation-markets-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-62e0ce9b8f081e9f3bd21039#block-62e0ce9b8f081e9f3bd21039\">has hiked its prices by<strong> 9.7%</strong> in the last quarter</a>, and still saw sales volumes rise.</p> <p>Sales of its baby formula products surged, due to shortages in the US.</p> <p>And <strong>Kraft Heinz</strong> put up its prices by 12.4%, having been hit by rising costs for raw materials.</p> <p>Both <strong>Reckitt </strong>and <strong>Heinz </strong>have lifted their forecasts for the year, after their price rises helped them beat expectations.</p> <p>Shoppers are already suffering higher prices, with shop price inflation hitting the highest level since at least 2005 this month.

During the quarter, Reckitt increased prices by 9.7% without having a detrimental impact on sales.</p> <p>Consumer staples businesses like Reckitt and Unilever look well positioned to navigate the unfavourable macro environment and the threat of recession given their ability to pass on extra costs to consumers and given the essential rather than discretionary nature of their product offering.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matt Britzman</strong>, equity analyst at <strong><a href=\"https://www.hl.co.uk/\">Hargreaves Lansdown</a> </strong>says Reckitt’s performance is impressive (<em>although customers won’t be impressed with higher bills at the checkout...</em>)</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Price hikes were all but guaranteed given the double-digit inflation in certain costs the group’s seeing, but impressively volumes are still growing.</p> <p>That’s testament to the defensive nature of Reckitt’s portfolio, cleaning and hygiene products are hardly going to be the first things left off shopping lists when wallets are stretched.<br></p> <p>Performance from key brands Dettol and Lysol continue to support the argument that increased hygiene awareness is here to stay.

inflation soars</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets.</strong></p> <p>With shop prices rising at a fastest pace in the shops, <strong>Reckitt </strong><strong>Benckiser </strong>has become the latest consumer goods firm to hike its prices in the inflationary squeeze.</p> <p>Reckitt, the firm behind Dettol, Nurofen, Strepsils and Durex, has reported this morning that its lifted its prices by<strong> 9.7%</strong> in the last quarter, year-on-year.</p> <p>These steep price hikes helped to lift Reckitt’s sales by 11.9% in the quarter -- beating forecasts -- with the company also benefitting from the US baby formula crisis in which rival Abbott Laboratories has recalled products.</p> <p><strong>Reckitt </strong>reports it saw...</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Strong [revenue] growth across our Health (+24.2%), Nutrition (+26.8%) and Hygiene (-2.5%, +8.9% excluding Lysol) portfolios, with Lysol in line with expectations.</p> <p>Growth includes an estimated 3.3% benefit from US Nutrition temporary competitor supply issues. </p> </blockquote> <p>Like companies across the economy, Reckitt has seen its costs jump this year as commodities such as oil, paper, plastic and chemicals become much more expensive.</p> <p>It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The input environment remains unpredictable. We continue to expect inflation on our cost of goods sold to remain in the high teens for the full year, based on current commodity pricing. </p> </blockquote> <p>But despite these pressures, Reckit has now lifted its expectations for 2022, predicting revenue growth of between 5% and 8%, up from 1%-4%. It expects growth in adjusted operating margins too (as those price rises support profitability).</p> <p>These rising prices will be passed onto consumers, intensifying the squeeze on households.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KeySignals/status/1552182158885900288\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Reckitt Benckiser raises its sales forecast after weathering soaring inflation and benefiting from an infant formula shortage in the US <a href=\"https://t.co/22afBRgrzX\">https://t.co/22afBRgrzX</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@business</a></p>&mdash; KeySignals (@KeySignals) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeySignals/status/1552182158885900288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 27, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Shoppers are already under pressure, with UK shop price annual inflation accelerating to 4.4% in July, up from 3.1% in June, according to the British Retail Consortium this morning. </p> <p>That’s the highest reading since its survey began 17 years ago, with food prices rising sharply.</p> <p><strong>Helen Dickinson OBE, </strong>Chief Executive of the <strong>British Retail Consortium</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“July saw the highest rate of shop price inflation since our index began in 2005, as heightened cost pressures continued to filter through to customers.

I have been giddily sending pictures of pewter skies and cagoule sightings to my sister who, unwisely for a red-headed northerner, lives in steamy Paris. The whole business feels like a collective fever dream, but, of course, it wasn’t: as melted roads and scorched verges, drifts of autumnal leaves and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/25/uk-drought-extreme-heat-dry\">warnings of an imminent drought declaration</a> demonstrate, and as thousands of climate scientists testify hourly with weary urgency.</p> <p>So, as our brains return to room temperature, it’s time to work out how to respond next time.

This was an eccentric, but apparently successful approach: his climate-controlled office was icy. “Air conditioning is a maladaptive heat response,” I hissed at him from my own heatwave office (a wet towel on the bathroom floor), listlessness momentarily pierced by bitter envy. The ancient dog repeatedly got into his furry padded envelope bed and had to be physically restrained from coddling himself to death. My best friend posted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madevi/status/1548669789861777411\">a very funny Twitter thread</a> on her ancestral Cambodian strategies for heat survival (sample tip: “When you’re too tired to keep doing nothing, take a nap. You can try using a fan if you want, but that will only waft the mosquitoes about, up to you”) and had the Khmer Rouge explained to her by strangers. Paris sister took the 19th-century aristocrat’s approach and headed to the coast, only to be greeted by record-breaking 40C temperatures there. Checking in on my stepfather, who is also ginger, and in the age bracket where checking in is recommended, I was initially worried: “I’m calling innocent and guilty to repent, for the day is at hand,” he texted, floridly, as if the four horsemen of the Apocalypse were just parking up in the short stay around the corner. By early evening, his angrily eschatological response felt entirely appropriate.</p> <p>My coping mechanism was to become even more obsessed than usual with my local flora and fauna. It was eerie out in the hairdryer heat: lairy local sparrows cowed into silence, the vegetation crispy and shrivelled. In the garden, a vast gull wandered, open-beaked and confused, in search of shade (or, knowing gulls, possibly carrion). I topped up birdbaths, put out rehydrated mealworms, chucked washing-up water on plants and distributed <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/SaviourBees\">bee revival kits</a> to bemused family members. I fretted about the pigeon fledglings in the tree outside my window and tried to persuade everyone to shower standing in a bucket.</p> <p>I am not virtue signalling my selfless, saintly response: it is my version of climate denial, trying to create a tiny, self-contained corner where I can, as far as possible, pretend disaster is not happening. That is a failure of imagination like any other, really. Faced with the scale of human tragedy from the climate crisis now and the prospect of worse to come, I am trying to persuade two gormless pigeons to take a bath. It’s just fiddling really, while, well, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/jul/26/how-europe-has-been-hit-by-record-fire-damage-and-temperatures\">everywhere burns</a>.</p> <p>The truth, of course, is that even if we mend our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPnJM3zWfUo\">Mad Dogs and Englishmen</a> ways, learn to close the curtains, and hydrate, we cannot really cope. “I can’t go through that again,” said my stepfather the next day. “But what’s the alternative?” I asked, “Die?” He said that was, indeed, his medium-term strategy. For the rest of us, the best and sanest adaptative response is anger, and action.

That compares with the £374m it released during the same period last year.</p> <p>However, Nunn said the worst-off customers would not have borrowed money from the bank, and so would not be at risk of defaulting. He added that hundreds of staff were being trained to help struggling families manage their finances, while the bank stressed that the number of customers in arrears remained at “low levels”.</p> <p>The charge linked to potential defaults mostly offset an increase in income from loans and mortgages related to a jump in interest rates. Pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of June were in line with the same period last year at just over £2bn, exceeding analyst estimates of £1.6bn. </p> <p>UK banks have largely benefited from nine consecutive months of interest rate rises by the Bank of England, where policymakers have been trying to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-inflation-rise-petrol-diesel-prices\">soaring inflation</a> under control. Rising rates are usually good news for bank finances, since banks are able to charge borrowers more for loans and mortgages, which in turn increases their net interest margin – a key measure of profitability and growth.</p> <p>Lloyds’ net interest margin – the difference between what it earns from loans and pays for deposits – rose to 2.87% in the second quarter compared with 2.5% last year.</p> <p>However, Nunn said mortgage lending – which grew £2.2bn over the quarter – was likely to slow over the coming months. “We are predicting a slowdown in mortgage growth and also a slowdown in house prices, but … we are also thinking we can continue to grow our lending [by] single digits in the next 12-18 months,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lloyds’ second-quarter figures came amid an economic slowdown, with the bank predicting little or no growth in gross domestic product over the rest of the year, and a 0.5% increase in 2023. That forecast will partly be affected by inflation peaking at 10-11%, before declining in the latter half of next year.</p> <p>Lloyds executives said they were still encouraged by forecasts for unemployment, which were expected to stay steady at just under 4%, while interest rates were expected to peak at about 2.25%.</p> <p>“It is a very different shock that we’re experiencing, relative to the last 25 years in the UK history. But there’s a lot to learn from some of those previous shocks that the economy has been through,” Nunn said.</p> <p>He said it was worth considering how emerging economies had dealt with similar economic situations in recent years. “I take a lot of personal experience from those experiences in places like Mexico, India, parts of other parts of Asia, where we saw really significant inflation, but employment rates [are] high. There’s quite a lot to be learned from that.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2022/jul/27/crown-court-sentencing-remarks-to-be-televised-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T14:30:20Z","webTitle":"Crown court sentencing remarks to be televised for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jul/27/crown-court-sentencing-remarks-to-be-televised-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2022/jul/27/crown-court-sentencing-remarks-to-be-televised-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Crown court sentencing remarks to be televised for first time","trailText":"‘Landmark moment for open justice’ comes after long campaign by BBC, ITN and Sky","byline":"Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent","body":"<p>The Old Bailey will be opened up to cameras on Thursday as sentencing remarks from a crown court case in England and Wales are broadcast for the first time.</p> <p>The move, which comes after a change in the law, is intended to help the public get a better understanding of how sentencing decisions are taken.

The knock-on effect for Suffolk’s rivers and seawater will soon be clear, says author William Atkins","byline":"William Atkins","body":"<p>Last week, the government gave the go-ahead for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-government-gives-go-ahead-to-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plant\">new nuclear power station to be developed</a> on the Suffolk coast. Providing low-carbon electricity for about 6m homes, Sizewell C will stand alongside two existing stations, Sizewell B and the decommissioned Sizewell A. I live close enough to see the 60-metre tall, white dome of Sizewell B almost every day. When I want to torture myself, I look at developer EDF’s “<a href=\"https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/EN010012/EN010012-007760-Sizewell%20C%20Project%20-%20Other-%20SZC%20Bk9%209.99%20Comments%20on%20Earlier%20Deadlines%20and%20Subsequent%20Written%20Submissions%20Part%203%20of%203.pdf\">construction phase visualisations</a>” of the 1,380-acre building site, with its towering spoil heaps and forest of cranes, and wonder if this is what it will take to save the planet.</p> <p>What might not have been immediately obvious in the coverage of the government’s decision was that the Planning Inspectorate, tasked with assessing such projects, had recommended that permission be refused. The problem, the examiners explained, was fairly simple: EDF couldn’t say exactly where it would obtain one of the main substances needed to make a nuclear power station work, that substance being water.</p> <p>As well as uranium, a reactor of the kind EDF plans to build needs water in very great volumes. Saltwater will do for part of the process, which is one reason why nuclear power stations are usually built beside the sea. But fresh or “potable” water will also be needed – first, to cool the two reactors, and then, just as importantly, to cool the irradiated fuel once it has been removed from the reactors. For this, absolutely pure water is essential. Sizewell B uses about 800,000 litres of potable water per day; Sizewell C, with its twin reactors, will need more than 2m litres per day, and as much as 3.5m litres per day during construction.</p> <p>Last September, during the closing hearings of the six-month public planning examination, the question of just <em>where</em> the developer was going to get the water to run Sizewell C, let alone build it, was becoming urgent. Those who had raised <a href=\"https://www.becclesandbungayjournal.co.uk/news/sizewell-c-threat-to-water-supplies-1871084\">concerns</a> about precisely this issue more than 10 years earlier would have been forgiven for feeling frustrated. As one of the driest parts of the country, Suffolk is described by the Environment Agency as “seriously water stressed”. By 2043, eight years into Sizewell C’s 60-year operating life, the agency anticipates a water deficit in the county of more than 7m litres a day. Northumbrian Water, which operates locally as Essex and Suffolk Water, had made it clear to EDF that there was not enough local groundwater for either construction or operation. EDF’s plan, therefore, was to build a pipeline to bring water from the River Waveney, 18 miles away on the Norfolk border. During at least the first two years of construction, while the pipeline was being built, EDF planned to install a temporary desalination plant on the site to turn saltwater from the sea into fresh.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/09/britain-was-promised-bold-visionary-energy-policy-sold-a-dud\">Britain was promised a bold and visionary energy plan. But we’ve been sold a dud | Jim Watson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, in August<strong>,</strong> the water company broke the news that its abstraction licenses dictating how much water it could extract from the Waveney, granted by the Environment Agency, were likely to be reduced by up to 60% to safeguard downstream levels. It subsequently confirmed that the Waveney did not, after all, have the capacity to supply water for for any of the 10-year construction phase. </p> <p>Desalination, opponents of the project noted, was a solution EDF itself had <a href=\"https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/EN010012/EN010012-003013-SZC_Bk6_6.14_ESAdd_V3_Ch2_Appx2.2.A_D_DoD.pdf\">discounted</a> in January 2021 “due to concerns with power consumption, sustainability, cost and wastewater discharge”. And yet, desalination, with all the problems it had set out (including discharging millions of litres a day of saline concentrate and phosphorus into the North Sea), remains EDF’s “fallback” solution for running the station, as well as building it, if another source can’t be found. Northumbrian Water has since confirmed that: “Existing water resources (including the River Waveney) will not be sufficient to meet forecast mains water demand, including the operational demand of Sizewell C.”</p> <p>For his part, the secretary of state, Kwasi Kwarteng, has a “reasonable level of certainty” that 2m litres of water a day will be found from elsewhere by the time the reactors are ready to be switched on. Perhaps, as Northumbrian Water has suggested, by piping it in from Essex (though Essex isn’t overburdened with water); or by reducing household wastage; or by reusing effluent. It will be for the Environment Agency, the Water Services Regulation Authority, Natural England and the Office for Nuclear Regulation to ensure that everything is done properly at such time as a water source – some kind of source – is settled upon.</p> <p>The more I look at those mock-ups of the building site, the more they seem like a metaphor for another kind of despoilment. Given the government’s stated <strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-energy-security-strategy/british-energy-security-strategy\">intention</a></strong> to build a fleet of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/johnson-to-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy-despite-sunaks-reservations\">new nuclear power stations</a> across the country, it’s not just people who live in Suffolk who have reason to wonder what the secretary of state’s decision to wash his hands of Sizewell C’s water problem says about the resilience of the systems we entrust with safeguarding our environment. Still, the foundations will be laid, I suppose, and the cranes will rise, and after 10 years and £20bn (by EDF’s reckoning), Sizewell C will be built. And when the time comes for its reactors to go critical, there <em>will</em> be water, because if there isn’t, Suffolk will have a new tourist attraction to rival Framlingham Castle: the most expensive white elephant in human history.</p> <p>What this fait accompli means for Suffolk’s rivers and seawater, let alone for the county’s householders and farmers, are not questions that will be answered before building begins.

I am not used to this at video games events – back in the 00s, it was mostly men in black T-shirts with logos on them, and I was one of about three women in the room. But this is the first in-person <a href=\"https://gaymingmag.com/awards/\">Gayming awards</a>, an event that celebrates queer representation in video games, and the huge and ever-growing queer community that plays them.</p> <p>This might not be what some people would think of as the gaming audience, but the fact is that just about everybody plays games now – two-thirds of all Americans, to pluck just one stat – and of course, queer people have always been part of that community. If anything, queer people are overrepresented in the gaming population. Fully 21% of all the people working in the games industry identify as LGBTQ+, <a href=\"https://ukie.org.uk/UK-games-industry-census-2020\">according to a recent survey</a> by sector champion Ukie. Until quite recently, though, this was not reflected in games themselves, whose makers and marketers seemed resolutely committed to making games starring either white heterosexual males shooting at things, or anthropomorphic animals. When I was growing up in the 90s, even female representation in games was dismal, let alone queer representation.</p> <p>But things are changing, and gaming is mirroring increased LGBTQ+ visibility in TV and film. A series like Mae Martin’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/18/feel-good-review-mae-martin-canadian-standup-charlotte-ritchie-series\">Feel Good</a>, about a formerly straight-presenting bi woman in her first relationship with a non-binary queer person, did not exist in 1999; neither did a game like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/sep/08/life-is-strange-true-colours-review-an-earnest-drama-about-a-psychic-empath\">Life is Strange: True Colors</a>, a small-town mystery about a bisexual psychic, which picked up <a href=\"https://gaymingmag.com/2022/04/gayming-awards-2022-winners-revealed/\">three accolades</a> at the Gayming awards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6fc79742e6ab4a055ed522f0ba9cc07e214629e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6fc79742e6ab4a055ed522f0ba9cc07e214629e/0_0_1300_731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Life is Strange: True Colors screenshot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bisexual psychic … Life is Strange: True Colors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Square Enix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We’re seeing games feature LGBTQIA+ characters, queer coming out stories, and queer relationships,” says Stephanie DeBiase, gaming and future tech coordinator at the youth-focused <a href=\"https://itgetsbetter.org/about/\">It Gets Better Project</a>. “More and more, games are giving players more options to create characters that reflect them, removing binary gender selection, building character customisation that allows for subversive and nuanced gender expression, including non-binary pronoun options, and more. Games that offer the opportunity for romance are starting to allow players LGBTQIA+ romance options. This representation is not only making games more enjoyable for LGBTQIA+ players, but also helping gamers explore their queerness in safe, virtual spaces.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is an art form that speaks to a lot of different people and backgrounds, and the more we include all those people, the better it is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Life-simulation game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jun/09/the-sims-gets-a-climate-friendly-makeover-in-eco-lifestyle\">The Sims</a>, first released in 2000 and now on its fourth iteration, has been a standard-bearer of queer representation in video games – though as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-kiss-that-changed-video-games\">reported by the New Yorker</a> in 2014, at first this wasn’t fully intentional. The decision was made during the original Sims’ development in the late 90s to remove same-sex romantic interactions between characters, but they were reinstated by a programmer named Patrick J Barrett III – himself a gay man – who was working from an old design document that made no mention of that decision. After two female Sims went off-script at a wedding during a live demo of the game in 1999 and started passionately making out in front of a roomful of journalists, developers at Maxis were waiting for the suits at publisher EA to demand a change – but it never happened, and so The Sims became one of the first games to portray homosexuality and bisexuality.</p> <p>These days, the developers working on The Sims 4 at Maxis are much more deliberately queer- and trans-inclusive, catering to one of the most diverse player communities in video games. Since May, Sims players have been able to choose their characters’ pronouns (though the gender binary is baked into the game’s eight-year-old code, so there are some limitations to this feature). An update this week also lets you intentionally define a Sim’s sexual orientation – although until now, all Sims were cheerful bisexuals who have been up for relationships with other Sims no matter what their gender, so as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kyssimmee/status/1548016829271945216?\">one player pointed out on Twitter</a>, what’s actually happening is that the game is finally introducing straight people.</p> <p>“I’m an openly gay man working in the games industry, so for me I have a vested interest in greater inclusion not just in the games we play, but in those who make games,” says John Faciane, associate producer at Maxis, the Sims’ developer. “It is an art form that speaks to a lot of different people and backgrounds, and the more we include all those people, the better it is … A big reason that I felt comfortable to come out when I did, even though I have a wonderful, supportive, loving family, was seeing representation of gay men within games – knowing that there were other people out there like me. Seeing people in the media and in games living their truths helped inspire me to be more comfortable with who I am.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14976dae706450f2f739ac96b7bc27b6f065f19f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14976dae706450f2f739ac96b7bc27b6f065f19f/0_0_1455_818/1000.png\" alt=\"The Sims 4 screenshot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inclusive … The Sims 4.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Games PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>John came out relatively late – in his late 20s – as did Phill Ring, executive producer at Maxis, who feels that games now play a part in today’s teenagers’ journeys with their sexuality and gender expression. “The next generation can see this representation, they don’t have to have the same experiences that others may have had growing up. [Decades ago] there wasn’t a lot that you could see in the gaming space or even media in general that felt like that was your identity. Now you can see more of it, and it is really important. I’m hopeful that the industry can start to take on this challenge.”</p> <p>Aside from representation within games themselves, the way that communities gather around games has also been a driving factor in changing the state of play: queer gamers – or gaymers, as many playfully identify – are more visible too. Discord chat servers, Twitch streaming and of course social media have brought people together and created sub-communities where queer players find each other. This year’s <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/why-twitchcons-drag-showcase-was-so-important\">TwitchCon featured a drag showcase</a>, alongside the usual competitive gaming tournaments.</p> <p>“Every year it gets bigger and better,” says 34-year-old Ben Austwick, <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/biggusbennus\">who streams on Twitch</a> under the name BiggusBennus. “Weirdly, when I started streaming, I never advertised that I was gay, nor mentioned it on stream … I quickly realised this was foolish. I’m aware that by streaming you have a lot of influence over those who watch you. By being someone who is an out and proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community, you’re providing a place for other LGBTQIA+ members to be themselves, whether they can at home or not. I wish I’d had something like this growing up.”</p> <p>As Ben points out, though, gaming’s general reputation for toxicity is not entirely unjustified, and outside explicitly LGBTQ+-friendly spaces there is still a lot of homophobia around. “I don’t believe it’s an overstatement to say that the gaming sector has a huge problem with homophobia, transphobia and other forms of bigotry, but it is being tackled at all stages by publishers and developers who don’t want their games tainted by it, which is heartening to see. It’s sad that we have to make our own groups, clans or forums to make sure that we play while feeling safe and comfortable to be who we are, but it’s becoming increasingly common to allow us to do this and some publishers actually promote it with special LGBTQIA+ events.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"714c69d34cca741e5858b66a77d5df23b5ca43bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/714c69d34cca741e5858b66a77d5df23b5ca43bb/0_0_4032_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benjamin Austwick aka Biggus Bennus, Twitch streamer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m aware you have a lot of influence’ … Twitch streamer BiggusBennus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Benjamin Austwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>DeBiase reckons that such publisher-led celebrations of queer players through, for instance, in-game pride events sends a powerful message of support and welcome. “LGBTQIA+ gamers want to see themselves in the games that they play … I’ve played games from a young age, and I often found myself in a heteronormative world, controlling a character that did not reflect me,” she says. “Gaming for me has always been about endless possibilities, about exploring worlds different from my own, so to see the same social constructs play out in the gaming space disallowed that desire for escape.</p> <p>“I found myself turning to games like The Sims because you had control over the majority of the world. I could create a character I identified with, explore new possibilities through self expression, choose which characters I wanted to develop relationships with, and of course, express myself in ways that might not have been possible or safe for me to do so in the real world. Now, I find myself only drawn to games that give you those options to explore freely.”</p> <p>When I was going through adolescence, my queerness felt like something best kept to myself. Opportunities to explore who I was came later on, as a student, when I started spending time in real-life queer spaces (I would still highly recommend a summer in Berlin to any confused teenager). Today’s queer teens and tweens get to see people like them in places I never did – on TV, online, and in video games, a medium I’ve loved since I was a child, but whose fan community never felt very welcoming to queer women like me. Looking around the room at the Gayming awards, I’m surrounded by people whose queerness and love for video games are both important parts of who they are – and nowadays, they are no longer at odds.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/jul/27/a-niqab-and-balloon-shoes-for-a-moroccan-basketball-fan-mous-lamrabats-best-photograph","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T14:07:30Z","webTitle":"A niqab and balloon shoes for a Moroccan basketball fan: Mous Lamrabat’s best photograph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jul/27/a-niqab-and-balloon-shoes-for-a-moroccan-basketball-fan-mous-lamrabats-best-photograph","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/jul/27/a-niqab-and-balloon-shoes-for-a-moroccan-basketball-fan-mous-lamrabats-best-photograph","fields":{"headline":"A niqab and balloon shoes for a Moroccan basketball fan: Mous Lamrabat’s best photograph","trailText":"‘We recreated a pair of Nike trainers and I used Michael Jordan’s number on the niqab.

We moved to Belgium when I was two but went back to visit family every year. They were the best times, when memories were made and inspiration was created. Nostalgia is one of my favourite feelings. It takes you back to when you were more free, and I’ve tried to put the things that I grew up with in my work.</p> <p>There have always been two parts to my work. Fashion, because there you can be creative; there are no borders – everything can be fashion as long as there are clothes involved. And then there are the things that I just loved doing. As a kid, I remember embroidering Nike logos on to the hat my dad used to wear to the mosque, because I thought it was cool. My work is a photographic continuation of that kind of thing.</p> <p>In 2020, I collaborated with a talented balloon artist for a magazine shoot. I’ve always been a big sneaker fan and asked him to create a shoe for me and he just did it. I took it home and, because balloons don’t last that long, shot this image straight away. It was around the time that the LA Lakers player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-death-nba-los-angeles-lakers\">Kobe Bryant</a> died, and I was creating niqabs with Kobe’s number and Michael Jordan’s number printed on them. I thought: maybe I can shoot a photo with the Jordan niqab and the Nike shoe, as though, what if, in a parallel universe, this would be the uniform for basketball?</p> <p>I try to create a parallel world where my own aesthetics are there, but with traditional garments. This is how I fantasise about things, and it feels like time travel, in a similar way to how in futuristic movies you see a lot of traditional clothing coming back but with very hi-tech things added. People often say I try to bridge two different worlds, but it’s more that I try to put together different times.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I often choose traditional clothes that remind me of where I’m from, the kind of place that I’m connected with, the things that I saw my grandmother wearing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Just as we easily recognise uniforms for nurses, so traditional clothing tells a story. I often choose traditional clothes that remind me of where I’m from, the kind of place that I’m connected with, the things that I saw my grandmother wearing.</p> <p>In creating these images for myself, I never would have dreamed that so many people would relate to them. There’s something recognisable for a lot of groups, I guess. I’m into sneakers, I grew up with basketball and hip-hop culture, and if you look at what’s cool right now it’s exactly that kind of streetwear. </p> <p>Race is something that preoccupies me. But in my work I focus on how much we all have in common. Visually, I try to show how the aesthetics of where I’m from work well with the aesthetics of another part of the world. I love that you can see all kinds of people, all colours and ages, staring at the same photo of mine at a gallery. This is how my whole imaginary universe works – showing that these things look good together; they work together. How come we’re not able to do that in real life?</p> <p>My recent cover image for <a href=\"https://www.gqmiddleeast.com/culture/mous-lamrabat-new-generation\">GQ Middle East</a> is a continuation of these things working well together – djellabas with basketball jerseys worn over them. We still go to the mosque every Friday with my dad, and when we were playing basketball afterwards we used to wear our jerseys underneath. Now I just put it on top.</p> <p>Occasionally I see negative responses to my work. Usually it’s about covering women, like: “Why do you romanticise the cover?” from a group that is against hijabs and scarves. Or people who wear the veil say: “Why are you romanticising and disrespecting veiled women?” It’s tough, but when I hear these things it’s usually after people have shared my work on platforms where there’s no context, and those people don’t know me or what I stand for.</p> <p>• Mous Lamrabat: Blessings from Mousganistan is at <a href=\"https://www.foam.org/events/mous-lamrabat\">Foam, Amsterdam</a>, until 16 October.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ebbda6ead256fc0c13ec9f2c8ecb0aca7c286ccb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebbda6ead256fc0c13ec9f2c8ecb0aca7c286ccb/0_1618_6700_8367/801.jpg\" alt=\"Mous Lamrabat.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mous Lamrabat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mous Lamrabat/ Loft Art Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mous Lamrabat’s CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Temsaman, Morocco, 1983.<br><strong>Trained:</strong> Self-taught.<br><strong>Influences:</strong> “Whatever brings up a feeling or emotion in me.”<br><strong>High point:</strong> “My first solo show with all my family and friends.”<br><strong>Low point:</strong> “People misinterpreting my work and breaking my heart with their ignorance.”<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> “Find your own ‘normal’.

To the world he was best known as a scientific pioneer, climate prophet and conceiver of the Gaia theory. To us he was a loving husband and wonderful father with a boundless sense of curiosity, a mischievous sense of humour and a passion for nature.</p> \n<p>“Up until six months ago he was still able to walk along the coast near his home in Dorset and take part in interviews, but his health deteriorated after a bad fall earlier this year. He passed away at 9.55pm of complications related to the fall. The funeral will be private. There will be a public memorial service later. The family requests privacy at this time.”</p> \n<p>Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, who knew Lovelock and has been working on a biography about him, said: “The news is extremely sad, but what a life and what a legacy. Until very recently he was in good health and had a remarkable memory for events that happened almost a century ago. He was smart, funny and happy to share intimate details from his extraordinary life.</p> \n<p>“It was thrilling to talk to one of the greatest minds Britain has ever produced. Here was a man who helped to shape many of the most important scientific events of the 20th century – Nasa’s search for life on Mars, growing awareness of the climate risks posed by fossil fuels, the debate over ozone-depleting chemicals in the stratosphere and the dangers of industrial pollution – as well as his work for the British secret services.”</p> \n<p>Lovelock spent his life advocating for climate measures, starting decades before many others started to take notice of the crisis. By the time he died he did not believe there was hope of avoiding some of the worst impacts of the climate crisis.</p> \n<p>Watts said: “Without Lovelock, environmental movements across the globe would have started later and taken a very different path. In the 1960s his ultrasensitive electron capture detector revealed for the first time how toxic chemicals were creeping into the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil where we grow our food. He was the first to confirm the presence of fluorocarbons in the stratosphere and issued one of the earliest warnings that petroleum products were destabilising the climate and damaging the brains of children.</p> \n<p>“His Gaia theory, conceived with the Pentagon consultant Dian Hitchcock and honed in collaboration with the US biologist Lynn Margulis, laid the foundations for Earth system science and a new understanding of the interplay between life, clouds, rocks and the atmosphere. He also warned, in clearer terms than any of his peers, of the dangers humanity posed to the extraordinary web of relations that make Earth uniquely alive in our universe.” </p> \n<p>Lovelock was passionate about, and committed to, his work as he felt it imperative to warn humanity of the incoming climate catastrophe. He said in a lecture in 2011 that he had no plans for a comfortable retirement because of this.</p> \n<p>“My main reason for not relaxing into contented retirement is that like most of you I am deeply concerned about the probability of massively harmful climate change and the need to do something about it now,” Lovelock said.</p> \n<p>His Gaia theory was ridiculed when he first proposed it, by many who believed it was “new age nonsense”. It now makes up the basis of much of climate science. He was also controversial among his fellow environmental scientists and campaigners because he advocated for nuclear energy. Now, many agree with his view.</p> \n<p>Another notable invention by Lovelock was a device that detected CFCs, which are damaging to the ozone layer.</p> \n<p>He is survived by his wife, Sandra, his daughters Christine and Jane and his sons Andrew and John.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/jul/27/heathrow-workers-share-your-experiences-of-work-this-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T13:28:58Z","webTitle":"Heathrow workers: share your experiences of work this summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/27/heathrow-workers-share-your-experiences-of-work-this-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/jul/27/heathrow-workers-share-your-experiences-of-work-this-summer","fields":{"headline":"Heathrow workers: share your experiences of work this summer","trailText":"We would like to find out more about what it’s like working at Heathrow airport this summer","byline":"Guardian community team","body":"<p>We’d like to find out more about what it’s like working at Heathrow airport this summer.</p> <p>Following flight cancellations, long queues, lost baggage, threats of staff strikes and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/23/queues-cancellations-chaos-what-has-gone-wrong-at-heathrow\">announcement of a 100,000 daily cap on passengers until 11 September</a>, Heathrow Airport has reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/26/heathrow-loss-queues-flight-cancellations-passenger-covid\">a £321m adjusted pretax loss for the first half of the year.</a></p> <p>We would like to hear from people working at Heathrow airport.

But it has not always been a smooth ride.</p> \n<p>This week’s announcement by Yury Borisov, the new head of Roscosmos, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/26/russia-opt-out-international-space-station-2024-build-own-outpost\">Russia will quit the International Space Station after 2024</a>, is only the latest expression of the country’s discontent.

The threat was dropped, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year sparked further upheaval for space cooperation that looks far harder to repair.</p> \n<p>The US and Russia entered talks in January to operate the ISS until 2030, but Russia’s war in Ukraine triggered a fresh round of sanctions, with some having a direct impact on the country’s space programme. Responding to the sanctions, Rogozin, who was dismissed as the head of Roscosmos this month, claimed the station could crash on an unsuspecting nation without the Russians to keep it aloft. (Rogozin has a reputation for wayward remarks, once suggesting Nasa transport its astronauts to the ISS via a trampoline.)</p> \n<p>Nasa’s current plan is to ditch the ISS in 2031, de-orbiting the ageing structure on a trajectory that would send any remnants of re-entry into a remote region of the south Pacific Ocean. In the years beforehand, the station may further open its airlocks to commercial enterprises, for activities as broad as tourism, sports and moviemaking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a2b6d781-2d09-4f8d-821a-7a5a0118c484\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w72OEfK5fB4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But the extreme uncertainty over Russia’s commitment means that space agencies working on the ISS must plan for the country’s departure while hoping it stays on. As Dr Pavel Luzin, a Russian military and space analyst, points out, Borisov said “after 2024”, not “at the end of 2024”, leaving the door open for longer involvement.</p> \n<p>Dr John Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said that with Russia’s stance on the ISS, space agencies would be in dereliction of their duty if they had not made contingency plans. “It’s been a hope that Russia could be persuaded to continue, but that hope was pre-Ukraine,” he said. “With all the ramifications of the Ukraine situation, resuscitating west-Russia cooperation is going to be very challenging. The US and its partners have to take this seriously.”</p> \n<p>If Russia quits, the immediate task would be keeping the station in orbit. That role is now fulfilled by the Russian Progress spacecraft, which gives the ISS periodic boosts to maintain its altitude. Northrop Grumman and SpaceX are contenders for taking over if Russia drops out, but it is not a trivial job.</p> \n<p>“It is not easy, but technically it is possible,” said Luzin. “The US and other partners do have all necessary capabilities and technologies for this.” Another option is to pay Russia to carry on with its station-keeping service.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to&nbsp;First&nbsp;Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Jan Wörner, the former director general of the European Space Agency, said his “personal belief and hope” was that Russia would continue beyond 2024. “The station without the Russians makes no sense … If Borisov’s announcement becomes reality, it is the end of the ISS,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Maybe with some extraordinary effort it is possible to keep the ISS without Russia, but I doubt that this will be done,” Wörner added. “I always said: space is a bridge over troubled water … and the Russian regime broke the bridge.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/27/buzz-aldrin-apollo-11-jacket-sold-at-auction-for-record-2-point-7-million-dollars\">Buzz Aldrin Apollo 11 jacket sold at auction for record $2.7m</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Whatever the fate of the International Space Station, the next step in human space exploration will see alliances shift. While the US, Europe, Canada and Japan have plans for the moon, including a lunar space station, Russia will partner with China for a separate lunar station and moon base.</p> \n<p>For Russia, the prospect of future space collaborations with the west looks dim, and that could affect its aspirations. “Russia destroyed the basis for these relations,” said Luzin. “The problem is that the Russian space programme is impossible without space cooperation with the west. Russia will lose its manned space programme, its space exploration programme, the Glonass [satellite navigation] system and even the military part of its space activity because all these fields depend on the American, European and Japan components, industrial equipment and technologies.”</p> \n<p>According to Logsdon, Russia’s discontent with the ISS is an opportunity to think seriously about whether the station has had its time. “The US could, with agreement of its partners, say enough is enough and change its plans and de-orbit early,” he said. “It’s been a symbolic success, but you can’t say every year it’s newly a symbolic success. There’s a fair question as to why spend multiple billions of dollars to keep it in operation.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2022/jul/27/senior-tory-urges-liz-truss-to-explain-deletion-of-abortion-rights-from-statement-caroline-nokes","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T12:40:34Z","webTitle":"Senior Tory urges Liz Truss to explain deletion of abortion rights from statement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/27/senior-tory-urges-liz-truss-to-explain-deletion-of-abortion-rights-from-statement-caroline-nokes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/jul/27/senior-tory-urges-liz-truss-to-explain-deletion-of-abortion-rights-from-statement-caroline-nokes","fields":{"headline":"Senior Tory urges Liz Truss to explain deletion of abortion rights from statement","trailText":"<strong>Exclusive:</strong> Equalities committee chair Caroline Nokes joins international outcry after UK dilutes commitment to women’s rights without consultation","byline":"Lizzy Davies","body":"<p>A senior Conservative MP has asked the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to explain why the UK government appeared to perform a “sudden backtracking on women’s rights” after commitments to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/22/european-countries-pressurise-uk-over-removal-of-abortion-commitments-liz-truss\">abortion and sexual health rights were removed</a> from an official multi-nation statement on gender equality.</p> <p>Caroline Nokes, who chairs the women and equalities select committee, has written to Truss, who is also the minister for women and equalities and a Tory leadership contender, asking why the key phrases relating to reproductive rights were deleted.</p> <p>More than 20 countries had signed <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220710135950/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/freedom-of-religion-or-belief-and-gender-equality-statement-at-the-international-ministerial-conference-2022/statement-on-freedom-of-religion-or-belief-and-gender-equality\">the original</a> statement that resulted from a UK-hosted conference on freedom of religion and belief earlier this month.

Here’s what our study found","trailText":"The results are reassuring: the changes are small and short-lived, and other studies show the jab does not affect fertility, says Viki Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology","byline":"Viki Male","body":"<p>In January 2021, my colleagues at the hospital were among the first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Comparing the side-effects afterwards, most of us had a sore arm, some of us felt feverish and generally under the weather, but one comment stood out. “My period was heavier than usual,” said one of the midwives. “But that happens to me every year after we get our flu vaccines, too. It’s just another of those vaccine side-effects, isn’t it?”</p> <p>Was it? I’m an immunologist working in female reproduction and this was the first time I had heard of such an effect, but it didn’t strike me as implausible. We know that various stressors, physical and psychological, can influence the menstrual cycle and vaccination is certainly a physical stressor; those of us who were complaining of feeling under the weather could attest to that. And yet I wondered why, if this effect was as run of the mill as my colleague seemed to think, it wasn’t something I had heard before.</p> <p>I found pieces of evidence here and there. Writing in 1549, the Chinese doctor Wan Chhüan casually mentions that inoculation against smallpox (an early procedure similar to vaccination) was liable to bring on menstruation unexpectedly. A report from 1913 noted that when a New York hospital started vaccinating its nurses against typhoid, a number of them noticed post-vaccination differences in their menstrual cycles. More recently, seven out of 16 women in a phase I trial of a Hepatitis B vaccine reported menstrual changes, while a survey of almost 30,000 Japanese teenagers found HPV vaccination weakly associated with an increase in heavy or irregular periods.</p> <p>Perhaps my colleague was right and menstrual changes are just another vaccine side-effect. But clearly this wasn’t something that was widely researched or discussed. It was more of a curiosity than anything else.</p> <p>But it didn’t stay a curiosity for long. At first, older and vulnerable people were prioritised for Covid-19 vaccination, but as the programme was rolled out to younger people, social media was suddenly alight with people saying they had noticed a change to their menstrual cycle after the vaccine. In the UK, Google searches containing the terms “period” and “vaccine” leapt in the first week of May 2021, and on TikTok peaks in the hashtag #periodproblems seemed to coincide with the timing of initiation of vaccination programmes around the world. Coming at a time when vaccine hesitancy among young women was being driven by false claims that Covid-19 vaccination could harm their fertility, the possibility that vaccination might cause changes to the menstrual cycle was, understandably, worrying for many people. Research was needed, not least because failing to properly investigate the potential link would fuel these fears.</p> <p>Menstrual cycles vary naturally, so without formal studies it was impossible to know whether Covid-19 vaccination really did cause changes, or if people were simply becoming more aware of changes that would have occurred whether or not they had been vaccinated. With this in mind, the US National Institutes of Health allocated $1.67m to investigate the potential link in US residents. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health repurposed a cohort of young adults it had recruited to look into other Covid-19 vaccine effects to see if there was an impact on the menstrual cycle. In the UK, no specific funding was available, so my team started two small studies on a shoestring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/22/covid-wave-prepare-new-variants-nhs-hospital-admissions-england\">This Covid wave may be cresting – now let’s prepare for the next one | Kit Yates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The results from those studies have been <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frph.2022.952976/full\">published this week</a>. We found that getting a Covid-19 vaccine could delay your next period by a day or so, but the timing of periods returned to normal in the following cycle. A <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2022/04000/Association_Between_Menstrual_Cycle_Length_and.2.aspx\">much larger study</a> from the US found the same thing. Interestingly, we found some evidence that this delay was less likely to occur in people taking combined (but not progesterone-only) contraception, suggesting that the effect may be mediated by temporary changes to sex hormones. <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3998180\">The Norwegian study</a> found that about 8% of people reported a heavier than usual period the cycle before their vaccine, but this increased to 14% in the period after they were vaccinated.</p> <p>The results of these studies are reassuring: the changes are small and short-lived, and we know from <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8807200/\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o142\">studies</a> that Covid-19 vaccination does not affect female fertility. They are also validating: the people who noticed a change in their periods were right to tell doctors and scientists about their experiences, and we were right to listen. Scientists are increasingly asking patients and the public to guide us in framing research questions that are relevant to them, and this story illustrates the benefits of doing this.</p> <p>But there is more to be learned. The clinical trials would have provided the ideal setting to differentiate between menstrual changes associated with Covid-19 vaccination and those that occur in the placebo group, as part of normal variation. Participants were not asked about their menstrual cycles, so this opportunity was missed. This happened, at least in part, because menstrual and reproductive health has traditionally been an afterthought in medical research. We should do better in the future.</p> <ul> <li><p>Viki Male is a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London<br></p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And you might just get caught up with a live job, which really is going to keep you in place for an awful long time. That happens quite a lot.

It was almost impossible to believe my luck, an England Euros semi-final just a short walk down the road from my house. This just doesn’t happen in Sheffield.</p> <p>The city has hosted tournaments before. Denmark and Portugal came for the Euros in 1996 and reportedly drank the city dry, forcing the local breweries to put on extra shifts to satisfy their thirst. It was a magical time and is still fondly remembered by those old enough to have been around.</p> <p>Even before Tuesday, the tournament had been a success for the city. The centre was taken over by Dutch and Swedish fans for the best attended group stage match that didn’t include England.

Many of my friends used the group stages as an opportunity to take their daughters and sons to their first match. It briefly united both sides of the city, Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United fans sitting side by side enjoying football without the local tribalism. It felt like there was a space for a different kind of fan in Sheffield for the first time, and I liked that.</p> <p>Tuesday felt different still. It was England, in a semi-final of a major tournament, in Sheffield. The 28,000+ crowd was full of local families, children on their first week of school holidays, being allowed to stay up late on a Tuesday. Groups of women, drinking but not drunk, wearing retro 90s England shirts and bucket hats. Men were outnumbered. We were optimistic and infectiously excited. We sang the national anthem, out of time and out of tune.</p> <p>The first 30 minutes were terrifying, England looked nervous and Sweden had the majority of the chances. I looked around at the families next to me and feared the worst, bracing myself for crying children and another hard life lesson in being an England fan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b7a4ce4a3a45011031d822a1b955949f0eb95cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b7a4ce4a3a45011031d822a1b955949f0eb95cb/0_68_4513_2708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England supporters make their way to Bramall Lane for the semi-final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England supporters make their way to Bramall Lane for the semi-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Simpson/Uefa/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lionesses/status/1552226084581740551?s=21&amp;t=gtoG746xO4eQq5sTIcbs0Q\">Alessia Russo scored the third</a> with a potential goal of the tournament I finally relaxed.

Walt and his French wife Anne (Aurore Clément) take Travis into their home, if not yet their hearts; and he lives with them in suburban LA, hardly more than a kid himself. Travis opens up about his dreamy long-forgotten plan to live in the little town of Paris, Texas where he was conceived, and he gets it together sufficiently to take Hunter on a road trip with him to Houston where he has discovered Jane is living. It is there he finds her working in a sleazy and somewhat bizarre peep show, a Lynchian touch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/01/wim-wenders-when-paris-texas-won-cannes-it-was-terrible\">Wim Wenders: ‘When Paris, Texas won Cannes it was terrible’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lonely geographies of Texas and the unglamorous Los Angeles suburbs are superbly caught, and Wenders and Shepard indulge a love of motels with their heartbreaking neon signs about TV and air-con; this movie did much to make motels the signifier of roadside reality and the American heartland, and rescue them from the taint of Psycho and the Bates motel. Walt, incidentally, has a job creating billboards, the occasion for some witty scene-setting: he shows us a poster of Barbra Streisand’s face, distorted and foreshortened like the skull in Holbein’s The Ambassadors. There’s a great extended scene as Travis walks across a highway bridge to the accompaniment of a male voice ranting hysterically. Is it the radio? No: it’s a disturbed guy screaming into the traffic whom Travis has been calmly approaching this whole time, and passes with a casual pat on the shoulder.</p> <p>Finally, there are those amazing, climactic scenes in the peep show, a metaphor for Travis and Jane’s alienation from each other. Kinski has the supremely difficult job of showing us Jane’s backstory in just two scenes. As Travis starts telling her their story (without revealing who he is), Kinski shows how Jane is at first bemused, then startled, then moved by what she still thinks is this story’s fortuitous resemblance to her own, and then her devastation at the truth.</p> <p>The sordid loneliness and weird alienation of these sequences, coming after the more reassuring story of domestic comfort and father-son bonding, delivers the film’s enduring impact. It is an eerie, sad story whose meaning disappears over the vast horizon as if on a highway heading away through the desert.</p> <p>• Paris, Texas is released on 29 July in cinemas and on 5 August on Curzon Home Cinema.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/jul/27/alessia-russo-banished-all-fear-with-the-cheeky-backheel-that-foxed-sweden","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T11:48:49Z","webTitle":"Alessia Russo banished all fear with the cheeky backheel that foxed Sweden | Jonathan Liew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/27/alessia-russo-banished-all-fear-with-the-cheeky-backheel-that-foxed-sweden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/jul/27/alessia-russo-banished-all-fear-with-the-cheeky-backheel-that-foxed-sweden","fields":{"headline":"Alessia Russo banished all fear with the cheeky backheel that foxed Sweden ","trailText":"Moments of inspiration are so rare at this level that the England striker’s semi-final goal was the last thing anyone expected","byline":"Jonathan Liew","body":"<p>Look, we’ve all tried it.

It is why wingers try to squeeze in a cross instead of taking on a defender. It is why defenders hoof the ball clear rather than picking a pass through the lines. It is why moments of genuine inspiration are so rare at the top level. The bigger the stakes, the bigger the quantum of failure. Aversion to risk is what makes us human. And so as Russo gathers the ball in the Sweden penalty area with 22 minutes to play in the European Championship semi-final, pretty much the last thing anyone expects her to do is the thing she actually does.</p> \n<p>By way of a thought experiment, let’s imagine Russo tries the backheel and it doesn’t come off. It skews off her foot or hits one of the two defenders tailing her, and bounces harmlessly clear. Worse, let’s imagine that Sweden win the ball back, work it up the field, create a chance, score to reduce the deficit to 2-1. Maybe they even go on to win and break England’s hearts. Perhaps Russo, who a few seconds earlier had just missed a golden chance to put England 3-0 up, now becomes the lightning rod for the angst and anger of a grieving nation.</p> \n<p>The phonelines of two-bob radio talkshows light up with fury. Russo’s backheel becomes an emblem of the complacency and decadence of this England team, perhaps even of English entitlement and arrogance. This, whether she is conscious of it or not (and of course she is not), is the risk/reward scenario Russo is shouldering when she takes on the shot. If all this seems a little far-fetched in the morning-after glow of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/26/england-sweden-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">a resounding 4-0 triumph</a>, then is it any more far-fetched than what really happened?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec5228474f79131cd52161d43608691161fb38c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec5228474f79131cd52161d43608691161fb38c/0_0_3007_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alessia Russo celebrates after scoring her outrageous backheel goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alessia Russo celebrates after scoring her outrageous backheel goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Let’s now take a moment to consider Russo. She is 23 years old and has already played for five clubs. She started in the Charlton academy before being taken on by Chelsea, where she played under Mark Parsons, now the coach of the Netherlands. She captained the development side. Aged 17, she made her debut for the first team. With the Emma Hayes era quickly gathering pace, Russo was clearly being groomed for a starring role in one of English football’s great dynasties.</p> \n<p>Instead, she left. She dropped down a division to Brighton: a smaller club with a sparser setup but one that could offer her immediate first-team minutes. In the summer of 2017, she moved on again to the Tar Heels of the University of North Carolina. Her highlights reel from her time there is a catalogue of pure filth. There are wicked stepovers and audacious shots from distance; feints and sole rolls; clutch match-winning goals.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/27/england-women-sheffield-relationship-with-football-euro-2022-bramall-lane\">England’s women write a new chapter in Sheffield’s relationship with football</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Against Wake Forest she closes in on a cross, sells an outrageous dummy to the keeper and finishes into an empty net. Against North Carolina State she gets the ball 40 yards out with her back to goal, sends one defender for a snack and a soft drink, turns away from two more and lashes home from distance. </p> \n<p>In her sophomore year, again against Wake Forest, she finds herself one-on-one with the goalkeeper and decides to try a naughty little dink. She plants her standing foot and the goalkeeper cleans it out, a hard knee smashing into a hard shin and breaking it at the base. She doesn’t play again for six months.</p> \n<p>The portrait that emerges from these early years is of an exuberant and yet ruthlessly impatient talent: a young woman who knows exactly how good she is, transfixed only by the goal and the quickest way of reaching it. If you’re in her way then she’s going to get rid of you. Nothing personal. If she doesn’t like the new contract Manchester United are offering her, she rejects it, as she did last month. </p> \n<p>For all her sublime technique and vision, there is little that is showy or ostentatious about any of this. The skills and tricks, the unsentimental arrivals and departures, the contract stand-offs, are simply the quickest solution to the problem in front of her.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"22781844-d23b-43e4-83b3-941bd2e0ed96\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/47vwKhafr8o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So as she assesses her options on Tuesday, she isn’t thinking about the shot she just missed. She isn’t thinking about what Colin on Twitter is going to say the next morning. She isn’t thinking about the time she tried an impudent little flick and got a broken leg for her trouble. She isn’t thinking this is a European Championship semi-final. There’s a ball, there’s a goal and all she cares about is the shortest route between the two.</p> \n<p>It takes a confluence of factors to produce a goal like that. A culture of empowerment and expression, where forces such as external judgment and fear of failure simply do not impinge. A coach who encourages players to live rather than simply exist. And being 2-0 up helps. Most of all, though, it takes a woman of Russo’s uninhibited skill and unshakeable will: a woman on the biggest stage of her life and scared of absolutely nothing.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2022/jul/27/englands-euro-2022-win-over-sweden-drew-peak-tv-audience-of-93-million","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T11:37:15Z","webTitle":"England’s Euro 2022 win over Sweden draws peak TV audience of 9.3 million ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/27/englands-euro-2022-win-over-sweden-drew-peak-tv-audience-of-93-million","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/jul/27/englands-euro-2022-win-over-sweden-drew-peak-tv-audience-of-93-million","fields":{"headline":"England’s Euro 2022 win over Sweden draws peak TV audience of 9.3 million ","trailText":"Women’s 4-0 triumph one of the most-watched broadcasts of the year, BBC One figures show","byline":"Jim Waterson Media editor","body":"<p>England’s Euro 2022 semi-final triumph over Sweden attracted a peak audience of 9.3 million viewers on BBC One, making it among the most-watched television broadcasts of the year.</p> <p>The figures do not include the many viewers who will have watched using the BBC’s online streams, or in public spaces such as pubs or fanzones.

A few weeks later, during an economic update in the House of Commons, the then chancellor of the exchequer set out his reasoning.</p> \n<p>Such a policy would “disproportionately benefit wealthier households”, he explained. Not only that but it would end up becoming a permanent £2.5bn subsidy at a time when he was painstakingly striving to rebuild the public finances.</p> \n<p>As the year went on, Labour floated the VAT cut time and again, proposing to fund it via a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. The government, with Sunak at its heart, repeatedly dismissed the idea.</p> \n<p>The wind changes direction fast in politics.

According to some predictions, a cap of £3,850 in January is a very real possibility, meaning bills would have gone up more than £2,500 in the space of a year.</p> \n<p>Of that punishing increase, 90% is down to soaring gas wholesale costs, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit points out.</p> \n<p>In the context of such numbers, the £160 that households would save by not paying 5% VAT on their bills is a pat on the head to soothe a kick in the teeth.</p> \n<p>There is also merit to Sunak’s earlier claim that binning VAT achieves more savings for high energy users, likely to be wealthier people living in bigger houses.</p> \n<p>“He called it right then,” said Sue Rathmell, a partner and indirect tax specialist at MHA. “His U-turn now is more about getting headlines in his efforts to win over the Conservative party than it is to help poorer members of our society.”</p> \n<p>She advocated something simpler: more generous energy rebates for those least able to cope with higher bills.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian&nbsp;business&nbsp;email sign-up\"> \n <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On Tuesday, a report by MPs on the business and energy select committee suggested one way to achieve this.

In Under the Banner of Heaven (Disney+), witnesses report that four suspicious men leaving the scene of a double murder are all bearded. If this were Portland or Shoreditch, where beards are not just lavish but artisanal, that would make all men suspects, but this is Mormon-heavy Utah, where searching for bearded men is less like looking for needles in haystacks and more like trying to find ZZ Top at an Osmonds gig.</p> <p>Andrew Garfield as Detective Jeb Pyre is an ideal Mormon. He is clean-shaven, soberly suited, eschews coffee and when his partner, newly arrived from the Sodom and Gomorrah that is Las Vegas, offers him some curly fries, he snaffles them furtively under the desk. When the latter cusses, Pyre gently reproves him. He’s soft-spoken and soft-skinned, most likely moisturising more rigorously than Mormon orthodoxy recommends.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDRqWtwbiSM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IDRqWtwbiSM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The pair form a double act as improbable as Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in 48 Hours. Pyre is unworldly, yet knows just what makes a Mormon tick, while Detective Bill Taba (Gil Birmingham, Jacqueline Vorhees’ Native American dad in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt) is a Paiute, so a non-white non-Mormon, doubly sceptical about the saintliness of the suspects’ innocence.</p> <p>We first see Pyre playing with his daughter, lassoing her with the lawnmower cable – good to see that Garfield’s spidey skills are still intact. But this sunny idyll is broken with a phone call: a woman, Brenda Lafferty (Daisy Edgar-Jones), and her 15-month-old baby have been found with their throats cut. We’re suddenly plunged into the darkling world of the crime procedural, where on no account must a detective turn on the lights at a crime scene for fear of killing the mood (which makes it all the more surprising the murder clear-up rate on TV is higher than in real life). Like the first episode of Twin Peaks, this murder will devastate a small town where murders hardly ever happen, especially when it becomes clear that it is not corrupt outsiders but Latter Day Saints (LDS) who are responsible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/26/im-drawn-to-darker-things-how-billy-howle-became-tvs-hottest-property\">‘I’m drawn to darker things’: how Billy Howle became crime TV’s hottest property</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What about the beards, though? Are the killers wearing false ones to confound the hated cops, or are they a splinter group of fundamentalist Mormons who want to revert to ye olden bearded days of yore? I’m looking forward to finding out at the end of this six-part series.</p> <p>When Jon Krakauer’s Under the Banner of Heaven was published in 2003, it juxtaposed this true crime with the early history of the Mormon church in the US, from the moment in 1823 when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Moroni\">an angel</a> directed Joseph Smith to a buried set of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates\">golden plates</a>, which he translated into English – a text he never dreamed would be adapted as a hit musical, namely the Book of Mormon.</p> <p>This dramatisation punches up the Mormons’ historic sense of persecution, from the days when they were a religious minority driven out of Ohio and Missouri until 1984, when the Lafferty family, businesses failing and tax bills mounting, take succour in century-old Mormon teachings about rejecting a purportedly overweening state’s taxation policies and polygamy.</p> <p>The book is adapted by means of flashbacks, both to the early Mormons’ travails as they strike out to set up Zion, as well as the events that led to the murders. We see Brenda as an interloper in the Lafferty family, a Mormon from out of state who yearns not to supply endless babies to her new husband, but to become a TV newsreader – an ambition that, to the Lafferty men, is an affront to patriarchal Mormon norms.</p> <p>The role gives Edgar-Jones the chance to be more animated than as the glumly ardent lover of Sally Rooney’s Normal People and less vexing than her turn as what Peter Bradshaw calls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/21/where-the-crawdads-sing-review-daisy-edgar-jones\">“Manic Pixie Dream Girl Murder Suspect”</a> in his review of the new adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/12/where-the-crawdads-sing-delia-owens-review\">Delia Owens’ Where the Crawdads Sing</a>. She must, and does, suggest something more nuanced – a strait-laced woman uppity enough to refuse to bend the knee to the polygamous patriarchy. That said, I could have done without the script informing us repeatedly that Brenda is pretty. Show, don’t tell, people.</p> <p>It’s an elegant and even topical adaptation that dares to ask big questions. What in this fallen world can make a believer doubt their faith? Should the godly render unto Caesar? Or should they hole up in a log cabin to do battle against his diabolical forces?</p> <p>No wonder some Mormons have been critical of this adaptation: it shows their church as including murderous rebels using a perversion of LDS theology to justify their crimes. But we need not see it that way. It is emblematic too of a certain kind of American, emboldened by Trump, who sees the state as the enemy and tooled-up resistance to it as noble.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/27/alleged-northern-irish-police-attempt-photograph-jim-lennon-family","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T11:02:59Z","webTitle":"NI police officer’s alleged attempt to share dead man’s photo ‘sick’, says family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/27/alleged-northern-irish-police-attempt-photograph-jim-lennon-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/27/alleged-northern-irish-police-attempt-photograph-jim-lennon-family","fields":{"headline":"NI police officer’s alleged attempt to share dead man’s photo ‘sick’, says family","trailText":"Deirdre Lennon says disclosure compounded her grief after her brother Jim Lennon’s suicide in 2012","byline":"Rory Carroll Ireland correspondent","body":"<p>A family in Northern Ireland has condemned as “sick” the allegation that a police officer tried to share photographs of their relative who had killed himself.</p> <p>Deirdre Lennon said she had not trusted the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) since learning about the alleged attempt to share online pictures of her brother Jim Lennon. “Not a chance would I ring the cops now.

However, he will be best known for a non-speaking role that made him recognisable around the world: as the distinctive Man from Del Monte <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F38I5rZP9Qg\">in a series of memorable television commercials</a>.</p> <p>A globetrotting fruit taster in search of only the finest examples to go into his products, the Man from Del Monte gave his affirmation – to an ecstatic reception from the nervous growers to whom he was a hallowed visitor – with a simple nod, after which joyous estate workers would proclaim “the Man from Del Monte he say yes!”. Tall, handsome and self-possessed, with a white suit, silver mane and panama hat, Jackson portrayed the businessman in 25 commercials that were shown in more than 30 countries between 1985 and 1991.</p> <p>Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Brian was the middle child of Gwladys (nee Hughes) and her husband, John, a mechanic. Educated at Thornleigh college in Bolton, he was asked to leave after his part-time job as a wedding photographer began to monopolise his interests. From 1949 he spent five years with the Fleet Air Arm’s photographic service as an aircrew photographer, before engineering a switch into the theatre.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F38I5rZP9Qg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F38I5rZP9Qg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Brian Jackson as the Man from Del Monte in an advert for peaches</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Although he had been a member of amateur theatre groups in Bolton, Jackson arrived in London with no contacts and no formal training. His determination to become a professional actor paid off, and he joined the Old Vic company for their 1958-59 season, appearing in Mary Stuart and Julius Caesar, and was then promoted to the role of Seyton to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-michael-hordern-1618094.html\">Michael Hordern</a>’s Macbeth after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/18/edward-hardwicke-obituary\">Edward Hardwicke</a> left the company for a television engagement.</p> <p>Two years in repertory theatre and a run in Johnny Speight’s The Knacker’s Yard (Arts theatre, 1962) were followed by seasons with the newly formed Royal Shakespeare Company (1962-64), playing small roles in John Barton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/12/peter-hall-obituary-british-theatre-rss-national\">Peter Hall</a>’s ambitious Wars of the Roses cycle and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/03/peter-brook-obituary\">Peter Brook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/22/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Clifford Williams</a>’s production of The Tempest.</p> <p>A later theatre highlight was starring opposite <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-ginger-rogers-1617100.html\">Ginger Rogers</a> in Mame at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (1969), and more recently he played Pte Godfrey in a 2007-08 touring production of Dad’s Army.</p> <p>His television parts got bigger after his 1958 debut in an episode of The Adventures of Ben Gunn, and he soon got the occasional lead, notably in Six Men of Dorset, a 1962 BBC Sunday Night Play about the Tolpuddle Martyrs. He was a recurring character in Smuggler’s Bay (1964, based on J Meade Faulkner’s Moonfleet), and played solid guest roles in The Avengers (1961), Z-Cars (1968), The New Avengers (1976), The Tomorrow People (1978), and most recently Doctors (2011) and Casualty (2017). He was injured after a fall while filming in Casualty, requiring medical attention, but insisted on completing his scenes before going to a real hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d26a0612e3ae7a7ef1b651de7603b480c3e85a90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26a0612e3ae7a7ef1b651de7603b480c3e85a90/1_0_3163_3955/800.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Jackson began his acting career in the late 1950s and was still appearing on television until recently\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian Jackson began his acting career in the late 1950s and was still appearing on television until recently</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After his big-screen debut as one of the recruits in 1958’s Carry On Sergeant (the first Carry On film), his movies included Gorgo (1961), Escort Girls (1974), Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978) and Shadowchaser (1992, as the US president).</p> <p>Dogged, business-savvy and entrepreneurial, he kept himself busy when not working as an actor. In the early 1960s he set up a photography studio in west London and by the end of the decade had converted a large Victorian school in Marble Arch into Hampden Gurney Studios, which offered photography services alongside recording and production facilities. He took great pride in the fact that the composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/20/vangelis-obituary\">Vangelis</a> recorded his Oscar-winning score for Chariots of Fire (1981) and his music for Blade Runner (1982) and The Bounty (1984) there.</p> <p>Jackson even tried film production, but his movie Rider (1974) remained unfinished after he found himself – and a cast and crew that included Orson Welles and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/may/03/features1\">Oliver Reed</a> – stranded cashless on location in Athens after an international stock market crash.</p> <p>His bearing, looks, and ability to convey what was required with economy meant that he remained in demand for commercials, including campaigns for Gucci, Mastercard, Mercedes, BMW, Barclays and many more. He was also an experienced presenter and voiceover artist, and an active member of the <a href=\"http://www.rnpa.org.uk/\">Royal Navy Photographers Association</a>.

Roman Abramovich is gone, as are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/22/todd-boehly-new-chelsea-chairman-marina-granovskaia-exits-shakeup-board-revealed-abramovich\">the Russian’s closest allies</a>, and Chelsea’s new owners have not had much time to get up to speed with the intricacies of English football since completing their £4.25bn takeover of the club.</p> \n<p>Yet the situation is far from disastrous. Chelsea have not gone away. The recruitment overseen by Todd Boehly, the club’s new co-owner and interim sporting director, has been encouraging and there has been no sign of Chelsea curbing their spending. Raheem Sterling, who should make Thomas Tuchel’s attack far more incisive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/09/chelsea-agree-50m-deal-to-sign-raheem-sterling-from-manchester-city\">is a solid buy</a> and Kalidou Koulibably is an important signing in defence following the departures of Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"163d2835-8eb9-4411-b1d4-fff0a5918cf6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nQI1KHnP4RU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In that context the picture does not look too bad. Tuchel still has a talented squad and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/10/ben-chilwell-eager-to-turn-adversity-to-englands-and-chelseas-advantage\">return of Ben Chilwell</a> from long-term injury is a major boost. A left side of Sterling and Chilwell? It does look pretty tasty.</p> \n<p>However it is doubtful whether the squad is strong enough to close the gap on Liverpool and City. Tuchel has issues in central midfield – N’Golo Kanté cannot stay fit and Jorginho lacks mobility – and Chelsea could be short of reliable goalscorers. Kai Havertz, expected to continue as the false nine, needs to become reliable. There cannot be too much of a goalscoring burden on Mason Mount and Sterling. If there is then Champions League qualification and runs in the cups may have to suffice.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/chelsea/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>Boehly and his fellow board members are determined to back Tuchel. They know they are unlikely to be able to find a better manager than the intelligent, charming, tactically astute German. Indeed, in a notable change from how Chelsea were run under the previous regime, the aim is to empower Tuchel and hand him the kind of influence Jürgen Klopp has at Liverpool. That was certainly evident in the way Boehly backed Tuchel when it came to sending Romelu Lukaku back to Internazionale, not to mention when the American passed up the chance to sign Cristiano Ronaldo, cementing the notion that the former Paris Saint-Germain manager is in charge. If there is a concern, though, it is in how Tuchel sets up his attack. Chelsea lacked incisiveness last season and drew too many games. They need more creativity and ruthlessness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"82b55ce57002b7d63a4cd8a5d7f2fdb6d20e0423\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82b55ce57002b7d63a4cd8a5d7f2fdb6d20e0423/0_128_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kai Havertz rues a missed chance in Chelsea’s 1-1 draw at Manchester United in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kai Havertz rues a missed chance in Chelsea’s 1-1 draw at Manchester United in April.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Raheem Sterling won four Premier League titles, five League Cups and one FA Cup during his seven years at Manchester City. He scored 131 goals for Pep Guardiola’s side, is one of England’s most important players and is approaching the prime years of his career. What’s not to like? Nothing at all as far as Tuchel is concerned. Chelsea’s head coach was determined to bring in Sterling after getting rid of Lukaku. Tuchel needed a proven goalscorer and he is convinced that the 27-year-old winger, who has joined in a deal worth up to £50m, will make his attack far more reliable.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>Mount, Sterling and Reece James are key players for England and they could come up against a few teammates at the World Cup. England’s second group game is against the USA, whose key attacker is Chelsea’s Christian Pulisic, and they could face France (N’Golo Kanté) and Senegal (Édouard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly) in the knockout stages. Elsewhere Havertz and Timo Werner will be involved for Germany – but spare a thought for Jorginho following Italy’s failure to make it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:21:46/embed.html\" data-alt=\"v\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:21:46/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>Good news for Jorginho: Handmade Chelsea, The Contemporary Craft and Design Fair, takes place on the opening weekend of Qatar 2022.

The 23-year-old midfielder came through the academy, behaves like the model professional and has been a consistent performer since breaking into the side three years ago. Ignore the nonsensical debates about Mount’s worth on social media. Some people think he’s nothing more than a teacher’s pet and say he brings little to the side, but they’re wrong. Managers love Mount, who looks every inch the future Chelsea captain, and so do the fans who follow the team up and down the country.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>The oldest player in the squad appears to have no problem reaching the youth of today. Nobody can come close to Thiago Silva’s 19.5m followers on Instagram. The 37-year-old Brazilian defender doesn’t need anyone to show him how to make an impact on social media. Check in for training snaps, post-match motivational messages written in Portuguese and English, and wholesome family content – and while you’re at it you should probably follow Silva’s wife, Belle.

Records obtained by Floodlight and the Orlando Sentinel show that Matrix consulted for FPL, as well as another Florida company, Gulf Power, and Alabama Power.<strong> </strong>Matrix affiliated groups have also worked to advance power companies’ interests in Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and in front of the Environmental Protection Agency, public records show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/co-publishing/index.html?vertical=News&amp;name-of-publication=Floodlight&amp;logo=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2021%2F02%2F26%2Ffloodlightlogo-03.png&amp;bio=Floodlight%20is%20a%20nonprofit%20news%20organization%20that%20partners%20with%20local%20outlets%20and%20the%20Guardian%20to%20investigate%20the%20corporate%20and%20ideological%20interests%20holding%20back%20climate%20action&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.floodlightnews.org%2F\" data-alt=\"floodlight logo\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/co-publishing/index.html?vertical=News&name-of-publication=Floodlight&logo=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2021%2F02%2F26%2Ffloodlightlogo-03.png&bio=Floodlight%20is%20a%20nonprofit%20news%20organization%20that%20partners%20with%20local%20outlets%20and%20the%20Guardian%20to%20investigate%20the%20corporate%20and%20ideological%20interests%20holding%20back%20climate%20action&link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.floodlightnews.org%2F\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In Florida, Matrix’s work touched almost every level of politics, from <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-ne-dark-money-ghost-candidates-tactics-20211230-7zelkoadffclde3z76ax3cgx3m-htmlstory.html\">influencing local mayoral and county commission elections</a> to combating<strong> </strong>attempts to <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-ne-senate-ghost-candidates-nonprofits-richard-alexander-20210826-ikxr7tks65go3eg6c5fubfubx4-story.html\">reshape the state constitution</a>.

FPL deployed lobbyists to the capital, while Matrix hired private investigators to dig for dirt and had operatives funnel dark money and order attack ads.</p> <p>Few examples are clearer than the case of South Miami. When the small south Florida city’s mayor helped pass an ordinance in 2017 mandating rooftop solar panels on new construction, a network of 10 FPL-aligned operatives mobilized to ensure his ouster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"061f07902747c72d24eb876f9429c02271640022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/061f07902747c72d24eb876f9429c02271640022/0_0_1440_1548/930.jpg\" alt=\"An attack ad targeting South Florida mayor Philip Stoddard\" width=\"930\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dark money group associated with Matrix LLC mailed attack ads against South Miami mayor Philip Stoddard to area residents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orlando Sentinel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team decided an effort to repeal the ordinance would probably fail. So they opted instead for “Mayor Stoddard’s electoral defeat and changing the makeup of the board”, according to a 2018 memo from Dan Newman, a Matrix contractor who was <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-ne-newman-primary-challenger-20220722-s7tdcvbknfadrnyrafuubbx7ny-story.html\">similarly involved</a> in the campaign against Rodríguez.</p> <p>Along with a private investigator, the group delved into Stoddard’s past for episodes to weaponize against him, such as a South Miami commissioner’s claim on Facebook that Stoddard had forcibly kissed her. Documents show Matrix operatives arranged for the commissioner to record a robocall in which she called Stoddard “a creep”. Pitts at the time forwarded a draft of the script to two FPL executives. Newman in his memo also took credit for <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/south-miami/article199413804.html\">a Miami Herald story about the allegation</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/26/southern-christian-ministers-climate-crisis\">‘A moral imperative’: how southern ministers are trying to change minds about the climate crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Matrix-led non-profits funded <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-ne-dark-money-ghost-candidates-tactics-20211230-7zelkoadffclde3z76ax3cgx3m-htmlstory.html\">a blizzard of ads against Stoddard</a>, accusing him of using public money for “vendettas” and placing him alongside infamous sex offenders Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein.</p> <p>The plan ultimately failed, and Stoddard was re-elected.

In 2019, when the electric utility industry was up in arms about a constitutional amendment to open up competition in Florida’s energy market, a Matrix-linked non-profit <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-ne-prem-senate-ghost-candidate-dark-money-utility-industry-20211020-sbve4xsysvazne3qxnci4epxmi-story.html\">poured more than $10m</a> into groups fighting it.</p> <p>Matrix also exerted political influence through the press, with its operatives acquiring control of a Tallahassee-based politics news site, The Capitolist. That gave Matrix consultants and FPL executives input on Capitolist stories.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/02-newspaper/giv-656273NKEXCT8iR7/\" data-alt=\"graphic showing acquisition flow of The Capitolist\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/02-newspaper/giv-656273NKEXCT8iR7/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The site’s publisher, Brian Burgess, a former top spokesperson for past Florida governor Rick Scott, also suggested in emails that Matrix should lure prominent Florida journalists to a new site or buy local papers owned by media giant Gannett Company and then lay off most of the “clown reporters” to “inject content” into publications without anyone knowing who was “pulling the strings”. That proposal was forwarded to Silagy at FPL but never came to fruition.</p> <p>Burgess said he “never pitched nor solicited feedback from FPL executives on any story or business venture”, and FPL spokesperson Chris McGrath said acquiring a news organization would not have made sense as a business deal for FPL.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Headquartered in Montgomery, Matrix has been<a href=\"https://yellowhammernews.com/15-joe-perkins/\"> described</a> there as “the closest thing Alabama politics has to a non-governmental secret agency”.</p> <p>Perkins and Pitts worked together for more than 25 years, expanding the firm into a national operation with dozens of clients in myriad industries. <br><br>But wherever the pair went, indictments often followed.</p> <p>An Alabama governor the company worked for <a href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2021/05/former-alabama-gov-don-siegelman-who-spent-6-years-in-prison-gets-law-license-back.html\">was convicted</a> of federal felony corruption charges.

In 1998, the firm <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/584297764/Jury-Gets-Election-related-Bribery-Case-Today\">distributed copies of a video</a> in which a sex worker falsely alleged she had been sexually assaulted by a candidate for lieutenant governor. The sex worker later testified the allegations were untrue, and that she had been paid by a Birmingham businessman to make them.</p> <p>In 2015, Matrix distributed fliers for a suspicious charity in a predominantly Black neighborhood in North Birmingham. The fliers warned residents not to let the Environmental Protection Agency test their soil for the presence of contaminants left by a coal plant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>They work off intimidating. You gotta bow down and kiss the ring</p> <footer> <cite>Terry Dunn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The charity was a front established by a state representative. A local law firm and the company that owned the<strong> </strong>coal plant<strong> </strong>used the charity to pay the representative. Three people were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/us/david-roberson-joel-gilbert-drummond-bribery.html\">federally convicted</a> for their role in the ploy. Matrix was never accused of wrongdoing.</p> <p>One of Matrix’s oldest clients is Alabama Power, which employed Perkins’ personal consulting firm as early as 1999. In 2018, Perkins Communications received at least $1.49m from Alabama Power, a leaked contract shows.</p> <p>Those who provoked the utility’s ire suffered a harsh response.</p> <p>In 2013, Terry Dunn, a Republican electricity regulator at Alabama’s Public Service Commission made moves to hold formal hearings on how customers’ energy bills were calculated – something that hadn’t happened in three decades. Customers at the time were paying some of the <a href=\"https://www.al.com/businessnews/2010/08/alabama_powers_residential_com.html\">highest rates</a> for electricity in the south-east.</p> <p>Soon, Dunn faced attacks <a href=\"https://yellowhammernews.com/democrats-embrace-republican-public-service-commissioner-terry-dunn/\">in the rightwing press</a> and online, while Matrix-affiliated groups – some of which received millions from a non-profit run <a href=\"https://ethics.alabama.gov/Search/SOEI_Form.aspx?ssSOEI_ID=202087\">by a contractor for Alabama Power</a> –<strong> </strong>filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings.

Dunn lost his 2014 re-election campaign by a 19-point margin to Chip Beeker, a catfish farmer who is still in office. Months after he was elected, Beeker voted in favor of an energy price hike for consumers. Alabama Power still hasn’t had a rate case.</p> <p>“Southern Company and Alabama Power run the state of Alabama,” Dunn said. “They work off intimidating. You gotta bow down and kiss the ring.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the firm’s activities. Perkins called Matrix’s work for the utility “confidential”.</p> <p>Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School said the “whole purpose” of firms like Matrix “is to conceal that it’s the utility doing this. The utility doesn’t want to be associated with this campaign.”</p> <h2>Things start going ‘sideways’</h2> <p>Matrix grew so large that by 2015 it was operating several private aircraft to whisk Pitts and Perkins to client meetings. Flight data shows Matrix’s planes made more than 130 flights to five states in 2020 alone, frequently crisscrossing the south-eastern US but also traveling as far west as New Mexico.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/archive-zip/giv-65627lJO77YQQAEN/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing number of stops taken by Matrix private planes\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/archive-zip/giv-65627lJO77YQQAEN/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In Perkins’ telling, he was getting ready to hand over leadership of Matrix in December 2020 when Pitts surprised him by leaving the firm, taking three employees – as well as most of Matrix’s Florida-based clients – with him to launch Canopy.</p> <p>At the Birmingham office where Pitts and the others had worked, Perkins said he found a backup server that “appeared to have been beaten with something”. The firm later recovered more than a million files, according to Perkins, who said they reveal years of hidden, “shadow work” in Florida. Perkins and Pitts sued each other, with Pitts claiming his former mentor had “never followed through” on handing over the company despite years of discussions. Once he left, Pitts said Perkins smeared him to clients in an attempt to extort millions.</p> <p>As their feud escalated, internal documents started to arrive in reporters’ email inboxes from unknown sources. Many of the documents have since been verified by additional reporting, public records or Perkins himself.</p> <p>Silagy, the FPL CEO, says the pair initially told him they had come to an amicable agreement about parting ways. He says he told them that he was disappointed, but there was enough work for both of them, “based on the good work they had done”.</p> <p>“And then apparently, somewhere along the way, Jeff and Joe got sideways,” Silagy said.</p> <p><em>Jeff Weiner for the Orlando Sentinel contributed reporting</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/jul/27/a-day-at-london-pride-in-pictures-we-are-happy-to-sweat-feel-our-legs-ache-bolstered-by-solidarity","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T11:00:16Z","webTitle":"A day at London Pride – in pictures: ‘We are happy to sweat, feel our legs ache, bolstered by solidarity’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/27/a-day-at-london-pride-in-pictures-we-are-happy-to-sweat-feel-our-legs-ache-bolstered-by-solidarity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/jul/27/a-day-at-london-pride-in-pictures-we-are-happy-to-sweat-feel-our-legs-ache-bolstered-by-solidarity","fields":{"headline":"A day at London Pride – in pictures: ‘We are happy to sweat, feel our legs ache, bolstered by solidarity’","trailText":"On 2 July 2022 author Irenosen Okojie and photographer Cherry Au captured the solidarity, sisterhood and snogging at Pride, London","body":"<p>I watch two Black men in love take communion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/02/pride-in-london-parade-50-years\" title=\"\">at Pride</a> from the packed edge of a street opposite the Trafalgar Square stage.

I do this more often than I would care to admit, inadvertently have my hands full with half of things when they should be free to capture moments that sear themselves into my consciousness. I calculate whether I can take my eyes off them for a few seconds. They are still wrapped up in their sweetness. I decide that I can. I stuff the danish back inside the crumpled paper bag in my handbag. I reach for my phone for an opportunity to discreetly take a shot. They are new suns with revellers oscillating around them in joyous abandonment. One slender, wiry, sporting an orange mohawk, shades perched on his head. The other is stockier, in a purple tie-dye shirt, with a softness to his face that belies an outwardly tough exterior. They walk past me, moving through openings in the crowds towards other moments of intimacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3230990056d4e5aff70e39d6da598806c10c9856\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3230990056d4e5aff70e39d6da598806c10c9856/0_1087_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pride in London, 2022 for A British Summer Day.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"b4f2c9bf070d966060fe7ad1df577e76d870b835\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4f2c9bf070d966060fe7ad1df577e76d870b835/0_1045_4295_5368/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pride in London, 2022 for A British Summer Day.

An intricate, neon-glitter face painting of flowers adorns the edges of his blue eyes. He clutches a few plump tangerines in his right hand, offering me one by way of greeting. I ask him how he is finding the celebrations. “Where I’m from, we don’t have something like this. It’s just amazing to see people being themselves, as well as the acceptance on display. It means a lot. Growing up, I couldn’t express myself in this way.” We smile as a teenage girl in a celestial white costume wielding wings and a sign saying “Angel of queerness” passes us, flanked by a friend, pausing momentarily when one wing folds in on itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are happy to sweat, feel our legs ache, bolstered by the solidarity surrounding us.

I think of a collapsed, rainbow-spattered wing ascending, of the Black men making lovers’ magic in spaces that collect their silhouettes momentarily like receipts. I think of Jordan dancing under a shower of bright matter. I think of standing not just on ledges but on the edge of a precipice, where snapshots of Pride seep into my bones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9e34d868956e1631fa6f11b99a536c3a3ec75e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e34d868956e1631fa6f11b99a536c3a3ec75e6/0_395_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A colourful scene at Piccadilly Circus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"c6a9709eb15a24bbcde3193b460f9f8434cb62e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6a9709eb15a24bbcde3193b460f9f8434cb62e1/0_782_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dykes on Bikes motorcycle club\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"679f90535e90b758909cc9017d19557892b9f1ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/679f90535e90b758909cc9017d19557892b9f1ed/0_751_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Elliott Douglas of Deaf Rainbow UK\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: a colourful scene at Piccadilly Circus.

Most of the characters are trying to figure out the boundaries in modern India – who thinks what, what’s acceptable, what’s a big deal and what’s not. </p> <p>In this list, I’ve tried to talk about other books on modern India – though there’s plenty I must have overlooked because of gaps in my reading, the size of the country and my questionable taste.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-state-of-freedom-9781784701734?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">A State of Freedom by Neel Mukherjee</a><br></strong>Neel Mukherjee’s third novel is so rare and brilliant as it paints a big picture of the country without losing any of the bristling, painful detail. Five interconnected stories talk about – among other things – class, poverty, migration and ambition, through characters facing vastly different circumstances: from an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/11/indians-abroad-return-diaspora-values-business-politics-society\">NRI</a> man and his son to a vagrant and his bear. I still remember reading this for the first time and being stunned by the breadth of empathy and beauty that Mukherjee uncovers even in the most brutal moments.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/when-i-hit-you-9781786491282?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">When I hit you</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/when-i-hit-you-9781786491282?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"> by Meena Kandasamy</a><br></strong>Our narrator is trapped in a terrifying marriage. To the outside world, her husband is a university professor and an intellectual communist. At home he’s a dictator – physically and mentally torturing his new wife in the name of re-education. But the narrator is determined not to break, even as she is battered. What we get is what the subtitle – Portrait of the Writer as a Young Wife – promises: a fiercely gripping portrait of herself, marriage, abuse and male ego told in the most clinical, acerbic and relentless voice.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/tanuj-solanki/the-machine-is-learning/9789389109474\">The Machine Is Learning by Tanuj Solanki</a><br></strong>Solanki’s second novel is narrated by a sharp upper-management insurance employee named Saransh. Saransh hails from small-town Uttar Pradesh. Having had to work hard on his way to a top job, he’s very much a company man – that is, until he’s put in charge of an AI project which will make whole departments redundant and many unemployed. He suffers a crisis of conscience, aided at least in part by his well-off liberal girlfriend. This book is less about tech, though, and more about corporate life and the essence of being a cog in the machine. Even more brilliant is its examination of courage and indifference, and the way they intersect with class.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/ghachar-ghochar-9780571336081?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Ghachar Ghochar by Vivek Shanbhag</a></strong><strong><br></strong>Originally written in Kannada and translated into English by Sreenath Perur, this novel follows the fracturing of a middle-class joint family after the business they start together becomes a quick success. In only 115 pages, Shanbhag and the book’s unnamed narrator show how family bonds can strangle you just as easily as they hold you up. The story is also an excellent demonstration of how it can sometimes be impossible to understand where self ends and family begins – a very common Indian phenomenon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b6357d91d8bab2fcde56a88bf0a1b331322319d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b6357d91d8bab2fcde56a88bf0a1b331322319d/0_8_894_536/500.jpg\" alt=\"Neelay Mehendale in the Netflix adaptation of Cobalt Blue (2022).\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neelay Mehendale in the Netflix adaptation of Cobalt Blue (2022).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://thenewpress.com/books/cobalt-blue\">Cobalt Blue by Sachin Kundalkar</a></strong> <br>A mysterious paying guest starts living with the Joshi family in their traditional Marathi household. Before long the Joshi siblings – brother and sister – fall for him. The stranger seems to have feelings for them, too. What pulls you into the book, more than the plot, is the unassuming and honest tone with which the story tackles family, sexuality, scandal and love in today’s India. Cobalt Blue (translated from Marathi by Jerry Pinto here) is now a cult classic, and understandably so.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/prelude-to-a-riot-review-for-whom-the-bomb-ticks/article29656037.ece\">Prelude to a Riot by Annie Zaidi</a><br></strong>In this short novel Zaidi goes about assembling a bomb. The setting is a small south Indian town. Religious tension, caste differences, labour exploitation and the ill-treatment of migrants all provide excellent bomb-making material. As the novel progresses, a quiet bleakness settles over much of the town and keeps growing. No one seems to have the power to stop it. The bigots, on the other hand, are industrious. They form committees, organise marches, send letters to the local newspaper editor and buy guns. While the book has humour and beauty, the urgent narrative that Zaidi creates – by very careful crafting of each character’s soliloquy – is one that will make you feel terrified and outnumbered.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adivasi_Will_Not_Dance:_Stories\">The Adivasi Will Not Dance: Stories by Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar</a><br></strong>Set mostly in Jharkhand, the stories in this intense collection feature characters rarely seen in Indian fiction: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/25/land-grab-tribal-people-india-adivasi\">Adivasis</a>. That’s not the only reason you should read this book, though. Shekhar is a doctor based in Jharkhand’s Pakur district, and a member of the Santhal Adivasi community. His writing is charged with unusual rawness, and the stories here are as captivating as they are unapologetically political. The title story is about troupe-master Mangal Murmu who protests against the state-sponsored grabbing of tribal land by refusing to perform for the Indian president. In another story called They Eat Meat! – one of my favourites – a Santhal family moves to Gujarat and has to change their food habits to suit the caste sentiments of the neighbourhood.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/one-part-woman-9781782275466?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">One Part Woman by Perumal Murugan</a></strong><br>This one, translated from Tamil by Aniruddhan Vasudevan, isn’t exactly modern – the book is in fact set during the colonial era in rural south India. The story is timeless, though, and its themes are still fresh in today’s India. The novel charts Kali and Ponna’s efforts to conceive a child, along with the stigma they face when they fail. Despite having an extremely loving relationship, they find themselves inching towards more and more precarious methods. A plan is hatched. Ponna is made to attend the last night of a chariot festival, during which the otherwise orthodox rules surrounding sex are relaxed. There, as she forces herself to meet another man for one night, you might hear your heart breaking.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-burning-9781471190292?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">A Burning by Megha Majumdar</a><br></strong>Majumdar’s first novel is not a thriller but sometimes reads like one. It follows the intersecting lives of three characters – Jivan, a Muslim woman who is accused of terrorism in wake of a Facebook comment she leaves; Lovely, a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/16/india-third-gender-claims-place-in-law\">hijra</a> who dreams of being an actor; and PT Sir, a sports teacher who wants to embed himself in a powerful political party. Lovely and PT Sir have the chance to help Jivan – though it’s not as straightforward as it seems. A Burning is short enough to read in a single sitting and yet captures so much of the current climate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/30/top-10-books-to-help-you-survive-the-digital-age\">Top 10 books to help you survive the digital age</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/a-gallery-of-bad-feminists-review-of-nisha-susans-the-women-who-forgot-to-invent-facebook-and-other-stories/article32980436.ece\">The Women Who Forgot to Invent Facebook and Other Stories by Nisha Susan</a><br></strong>Susan’s debut collection features 12 stories that are very witty and very fluent in the here-and-now. Most of them revolve around young women as they navigate love, loss, intimacy and boredom. What makes the collection really stand out is its effortless voice. The stories are also surprisingly subtle. My favourite, Trinity, features three college girls who think they are going to set the world on fire, only to graduate and realise, much to the surprise of the narrator, that they are settling down as if that was the plan all along.</p> <p>• Teen Couple Have Fun Outdoors by Aravind Jayan is published by Profile Books.

Beautiful to behold and light as a feather to eat; a jewel-like jelly is surely the perfect end to a summer celebration, especially as it demands to be prepared well in advance, leaving nothing for you to do but turn it out in triumph and soak up the applause. Yet few of us realise how easy it is to eschew the cubes. Have a go; I promise you nothing you make this year will give you more joy.</p> <h2>The fruit</h2> <p>Having tried one recipe, from<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/949b8c72-b83e-11e2-bd62-00144feabdc0\"> </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/master-it-9780007476497\">Rory O’Connell’s book Master It,</a> where the fruit is suspended in a contrasting jelly (mint flavoured in his case, though<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/29/easy-pudding-recipes-fruit-pie-jelly-nigel-slater-honey-and-co\"> Sally Clarke has a version </a>in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sally-clarke-30-ingredients-9780711237520\">30 Ingredients </a>where they’re set in a mixture of their own and apple juice), I decide that I’d prefer the jelly itself to be raspberry flavoured. But I’ll also be adding some whole fruit before it sets to provide some sexy textural contrast, and there are several different approaches to achieving this. In his book<a href=\"https://bryn-williams.co.uk\"> Bryn’s Kitchen</a>, chef Bryn Williams mixes the raspberries with sugar and water, puts them over a pan of hot water, and leaves it to sit for an hour until they have given up much of their juice, yielding a beautifully clear, emphatically flavoured result. But, eating the leftover fruit afterwards, it’s clear to me that it had more to give. Jane Grigson’s Fruit Book employs a similar, but slightly more violent tactic in that she heats the water throughout, noting that, by the end of the process, the fruit ought to be reduced to an unappetising “greyish-red debris” which sounds more satisfactory to home cooks hoping to get the most from their ingredients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b51b8f58a8ded672bf7321ba1970d47773be4c02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b51b8f58a8ded672bf7321ba1970d47773be4c02/0_662_3761_3761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bowl of raspberries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Others are even more brutal with the fruit – both<a href=\"https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/engl01572c02s001r026/raspberry-jelly\"> Elisabeth Ayrton</a>, who bases her recipe in English Provincial Cooking on a Cheshire manuscript from 1600, and<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-2797164/britain-s-poshest-grub-raspberry-rosewater-jellies-sweet-cheese.html\"> Tom Kerridge</a>, in his very own <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/tom-kerridges-best-ever-dishes-9781472909411\">Best Ever Dishes</a>, puree the fruit, seeds and all, then strain it. Ayrton then boils it up with sugar, and Kerridge sets it with gelatine.<a href=\"https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/chef-recipes/valentine-warners-fresh-raspberry-jelly/\"> Valentine Warner </a>boils the whole fruit and sugar together then strains the mixture afterwards in his book The Good Table, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rosie-birkett\">Rosie Birkett </a>crushes the fruit but doesn’t strain it before use.</p> <p>Much as I enjoy the texture of raspberry seeds (genuinely!) in the last, I’m drawn to the gorgeous clarity of Williams’ jelly – even the strained examples where the fruit has been pureed first are fairly cloudy – thanks, I think, to those seeds being crushed. The key to success, for me at least, is getting the most from the fruit while also keeping the jelly itself relatively translucent, so I decide to adopt a more interventionist take on Williams’ method, mashing some of the raspberries, and then heating them continuously, as Grigson suggests, to extract more juice from them. (If you don’t mind an opaque result, by all means squeeze as much through the muslin as you can at the end of step 4; I prefer to keep things clear, and eat the contents of the sieve afterwards instead.)</p> <h2>The extras</h2> <p>Ayrton is the only one to call for just raspberries and sugar – everyone else adds additional flavourings of some sort. Though my recipe is all about the raspberries, I’m particularly fond of Kerridge’s use of rose water (which pops up in a Tudor recipe in historian <a href=\"https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/42487\">Peter Brears</a>’ scholarly Jellies and Their Moulds) and O’Connell’s sprig of spearmint, which could be added to the bowl of raspberries in step 1.</p> <p>A jelly made from raspberry juice alone however is, as Ayrton’s recipe proves, incredibly intense – far too much in anything other than very delicate quantities, which means that the juice needs diluting with something. Birkett uses a mixture of fruity white wine and pomegranate juice, which gives her version a lovely purplish colour, and Kerridge opts for pure sparkling wine, which gives his a very adult flavour. Both are, needless to say, delicious, but for me, the other flavours take something away from the raspberries themselves. In fact, unless your fruit is very jammy and sweet, I don’t even think you need the lemon juice many recipes add – though I suspect you can’t go wrong with O’Connell’s dash of raspberry liqueur if you want your jelly to have a bit of a kick.</p> <p>For extra wow factor, or if you have a slightly larger mould than this calls for, you can set a layer of white chocolate mousse over the top of the raspberry jelly once it’s firm enough to take it, as<a href=\"https://www.cooked.com/uk/Rosie-Birkett/Hardie-Grant-Books/A-Lot-on-Her-Plate/Desserts--drinks/Raspberry--white-chocolate-jelly-recipe\"> Birkett does in her book A Lot on Her Plate</a>. It looks extremely impressive, and tastes even better. (Serve the jelly with white chocolate ice cream for a similar effect with rather less effort.)</p> <h2>The setting agent and mould</h2> <p>With one exception, I only try recipes using gelatine, mostly because I can’t find any alternatives, so I’d be interested to know from vegetarians whether agar agar, which can struggle in acidic environments, is effective with fruit jellies. (Ayrton’s relies on the fruit’s natural pectin rather than introducing a setting agent, but I think the 17th century may have had a different interpretation of the word “jelly” than we do, because the results are more like a fruit cheese. Nice with yoghurt though.)</p> <p>That said, jelly has clearly gone out of fashion in the 21st century; it’s impossible to find<a href=\"https://www.abraxascookshop.com/products/kitchen-craft-1-pint-rabbit-jelly-mould\"> a 600ml mould that isn’t shaped like an animal</a>, something that may or may not be desirable at your party. I used a rabbit – but if you don’t happen to have one of those either, you could divide this between four glasses, as Williams recommends, and serve it as individual jellies, or set it in a well-greased cake tin or glass basin. (And, if you’re in the market, I’m reliably informed that charity shops are a good source of second-hand jelly moulds – something to bear in mind once you try this and realise just how good proper jelly can be.)</p> <h2>Perfect raspberry jelly</h2> <p>Makes <strong>600ml (serves 4)<br></strong>Prep <strong>10 min</strong> plus cooling and draining<br>Cook <strong>1 h</strong><strong>r<br>Set 3 hr+</strong></p> <p><strong>100g icing sugar<br>1.1kg raspberries</strong> (1kg can be frozen but defrost before use)<br><strong>Oil</strong>, to grease the mould (optional)<br><strong>5 gelatine leaves</strong></p> <p>Mix the sugar with 300ml cold water in a large heatproof bowl, then add 1kg raspberries and stir until well mixed – don’t worry if some get crushed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1409ebadf9cf37fa9cc3a05a0451b124b719466a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1409ebadf9cf37fa9cc3a05a0451b124b719466a/388_1331_3021_3022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macerate and mix raspberries with sugar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Put the bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn’t touch the water, cover and turn down the heat as low as it will go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"568d8558268f331b1abb4ad5893c24e9905a9c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/568d8558268f331b1abb4ad5893c24e9905a9c5d/100_1662_3138_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simmer the berries in a pan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Leave for an hour, making sure it doesn’t boil dry.</p> <p>Remove the bowl from the pan and leave it to cool for at least an hour. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd41c151e74a87b09f0f7a967aaa8d8fb4abd792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd41c151e74a87b09f0f7a967aaa8d8fb4abd792/376_1913_3054_3054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Line a sieve with muslin and put over a bowl; tip in the berries and juices and leave for an hour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Line a sieve with clean muslin or some other thin material and put it over a tall bowl, then tip in the fruit and juices.

If it were up to me, it would last for ever. Throughout we have seen great energy in the stands, amazing football and the whole of England rallying behind Sarina Wiegman’s squad. The idea is to keep the momentum going next season. When the Football Association announced the fixtures for the Women’s Super League 2022-23 campaign, it <a href=\"https://womenscompetitions.thefa.com/en/article/barclays-wsl-2022-23-fixtures-announced-20221207\" title=\"\">explicitly said</a> it was “set to be the biggest ever” because of the home championships.</p> <p>Even after all the records and success, there is so much more to achieve. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/18/england-women-squad-euro-2022-whiteness-diversity\" title=\"\">Anita Asante wrote</a> last week about the England team’s lack of diversity and she raises a really important point – where are people looking for talent? Especially at a time like this, when the visibility is high and more girls and women are dreaming about playing, it is important to think about the future of women’s football in England.</p> <p>Josh Arnold, the manager at the Bloomsbury Football Academy, said that since the start of the tournament more girls and boys want to join their central London-based team. “We often say you have to see it to be it. Maybe we’re missing an opportunity. It would be fantastic to see the diversity that really represents the young people playing the game. However, I believe that the current group of players have really inspired the next generation of young footballers.”</p> <p>The founder of east London’s Victoria Park Vixens, Morgan Brennan, feels the main challenge is not to drop the ball after the Euros. For her, the legacy has to be thought of in terms of a broader impact on women’s football, beyond the professional game and big events. She said the Vixens have received lots of messages from women wanting to join and believes this will carry on until the World Cup in 2023.</p> <p>“It’s just getting bigger and bigger – record numbers of young girls playing football in the UK – so we expect that to continue.”</p> <p>At academy and amateur level, the hope is that the FA will increase investment in the women’s game; that, regardless of results, women’s football in England will become a source of joy, money and inspiration. Arnold’s and Brennan’s teams have hosted match screenings and some of their players have gone to England’s games, which helps them deepen their relationship with the game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e326f524581e7f84d96bca59fd22d3a397c9ebb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e326f524581e7f84d96bca59fd22d3a397c9ebb5/696_0_2395_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young fans in Trafalgar Square for England’s Euro 2022 semi-final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"974\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young fans in Trafalgar Square for England’s Euro 2022 semi-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisi Niesner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I believe that the interest will increase if we continue to relate to the players as we do with the men’s team,” Arnold said. “We’ve now all related to these individuals in the team and how they brought us together as a country, so we should now be counting down to the next competition, promoting tickets to their matches, ensuring that they are accessible.”</p> <p>Brennan agrees. “You’ve got young girls from all around the UK who are able to go and watch and it hasn’t been limited to London. Since it’s accessible and affordable I think that really helped with the turnout. It’s also been amazing to see it on the BBC and on billboards all around the country. It’s definitely the biggest moment for women’s football that I’ve witnessed.”</p> <h2><strong>Talking points</strong></h2> <p><strong>African accolades</strong> After the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations title went to Banyana Banyana, many of the other accolades ended up with South Africa. Andile Dlamini was the best goalkeeper in the tournament, Hildah Magaia’s two goals in the final made her woman of the match and South Africa won the Fair Play award. However, player of the tournament went to Ghizlane Chebbak, captain of the runner-ups, Morocco.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efb510ceb072745c823f670408fa77da938cbb60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efb510ceb072745c823f670408fa77da938cbb60/0_278_4176_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joy for South Africa after winning the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final against Morocco in Rabat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joy for South Africa after winning the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final against Morocco in Rabat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>South America</strong> Brazil and Colombia clinched their places at the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand after reaching the final of the Copa América Feminina.

What’s harder to reconcile is that Dyson, author of Grenade Warfare, a standard military textbook, also produced such lusciously romantic music.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.chandos.net/products/catalogue/CHAN%2010061\">Dyson’s oratorio Quo Vadis</a> was, in part, an attempt to purge the painful memories of serving in the first world war, confronting the vestiges of post-traumatic stress two decades on. Translated literally as Whither Goest Thou? the work represents a spiritual inquiry of an agnostic rather than Christian nature, questioning life, death and the great beyond. The 1939 festival for which it was intended was cancelled because of the outbreak of war; the first part of the work was performed at the Three Choirs festival in 1946, and then in full in 1949. In this fine performance some of Dyson’s soul-searching resonated still.</p> <p>Dyson’s chosen texts are a veritable roll-call of English poets from the 16th to the late 19th century, 17 all told, and also include words from ancient hymns, interwoven into nine sequences giving the cycle its nine movements. But, at an hour and three-quarters long, the dense wordiness is sometimes heavy going. The way Dyson deploys his forces – four soloists, chorus and semi-chorus and orchestra – is never quite conventional, while the outpouring of music is only original in the sense that no one but Dyson could have created a score that appears to reference so many late 19th-century composers while going its own meandering way, an ongoing lyrical flow, in lesser or fuller flood.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/\">Philharmonia</a> (in residence at the festival) under the baton of <a href=\"https://3choirs.org/about/meet-the-team/adrian-partington\">Adrian Partington</a>, Dyson’s mastery of the interplay of vocal and instrumental writing was clear. James Oxley sang expressively in the fourth movement, Night Hath No Wings, setting words by Robert Herrick for tenor soloist with eloquent viola lines, and reflecting the sweet anguish of Dyson’s meditations. Fellow soloists Rebecca Hardwick , <a href=\"https://www.alexashworth.com/\">Alex Ashworth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jessdandycontralto.com/\">Jess Dandy</a> also brought eloquence, and in They Are at Rest, their final Alleluia! seemed to epitomise all the feel and the tradition of this festival, itself three centuries old.</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://3choirs.org/\">The Three Choirs festival</a> continues until 30 July</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2022/jul/27/techscape-what-should-social-media-giants-do-to-protect-children","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T10:45:16Z","webTitle":"TechScape: What should social media giants do to protect children?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/27/techscape-what-should-social-media-giants-do-to-protect-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/jul/27/techscape-what-should-social-media-giants-do-to-protect-children","fields":{"headline":"TechScape: What should social media giants do to protect children?","trailText":"UK cybersecurity heads want companies like Apple to monitor suspicious activity on devices. It’s not the attack on privacy you might think it is","byline":"Alex Hern","body":"<p>This week, the technical leads of GCHQ and the National Cyber Security Centre made a powerful intervention into an incredibly controversial debate: what should social media companies do to protect children on their platforms?</p> <p>But that wasn’t how the intervention was taken by all parties. Others heard something rather different: tired arguments against end-to-end encryption, dressed up in new clothes but disguising the same attack on privacy rights with the same excuse that’s always wheeled out by law enforcement.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/21/uk-cybersecurity-chiefs-back-plan-to-scan-phones-for-child-abuse-images\">From our story</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Tech companies should move ahead with controversial technology that scans for child abuse imagery on users’ phones, the technical heads of GCHQ and the UK’s National Cyber</em><em> Security Centre have said.</em></p> <p><em>So-called “client-side scanning” would involve service providers such as Facebook or Apple building software that monitors communications for suspicious activity without needing to share the contents of messages with a centralised server.</em></p> <p><em>Ian Levy, the NCSC’s technical director, and Crispin Robinson, the technical director of cryptanalysis – codebreaking – at GCHQ, said the technology could protect children and privacy at the same time. “We’ve found no reason why client-side scanning techniques cannot be implemented safely in many of the situations one will encounter</em><em>” they wrote in a new discussion paper </em><em>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>You may remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/11/techscape-apple-iphone-child-abuse-images\">the debate around client-side scanning</a> from a year ago. To quote myself:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Apple is taking a major step into the unknown. That’s because its version of this approach will, for the first time from any major platform, scan photos on the users’ hardware, rather than waiting for them to be uploaded to the company’s servers.</em></p> <p><em>By normalising on-device scanning for CSAM [child sexual abuse material], critics worry, Apple has taken a dangerous step. From here, they argue, it is simply a matter of degree for our digital life to be surveilled, online and off. It is a small step in one direction to expand scanning beyond CSAM; it is a small step in another to expand it beyond simple photo libraries; it is a small step in yet another to expand beyond perfect matches of known images.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>So why is the intervention from Levy and Robinson important? To me, it’s a sincere attempt to address the concerns of these critics, to lay out the advantages of client-side scanning in tackling specific categories of threat – and to propose meaningful solutions to common fears.</p> <p><strong>The devil is in the details</strong></p> <p>To take one example from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09506\">the 70-page paper</a>: the pair try to tackle the fear that lists of photos that are scanned for CSAM could expand beyond known CSAM to include, say, images with a political character. In plainer language, what would stop China demanding that Apple include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/tank-man-photograph-tiananmen-square-30-years-jeff-widener\">the famous pictures of Tank Man</a> in its scanning apparatus, and forcing the company to flag any iPhones containing that picture as potentially criminal?</p> <p>Robinson and Levy suggest a system that would do just that. They propose that the list of images be assembled by child protection groups around the world – organisations like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the US, or Britain’s Internet Watch Foundation (IWF). Each of those groups already maintains a database of “known” CSAM, which they cooperate to keep as comprehensive as possible, and the scanning database can be made only of those images in all the groups’ lists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for our weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.\">  <iframe id=\"tech-scape\" name=\"tech-scape\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/tech-scape\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--tech-scape\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for our weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>They can then publish <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function\">a hash, a cryptographic signature</a>, of that database when they hand it over to tech companies, who can show the same hash when it is loaded on to your phone. Even if China were able to force its domestic child protection group to include Tank Man in its list, it would be unable to do the same for the IWF, so the image wouldn’t make it onto devices; and if it forced Apple to load a different database for China, then the hash would change accordingly, and users would know that the system was no longer trustworthy.</p> <p>The point is not that the proposed solution is the best possible way to solve the problem, Levy and Robinson write, but to demonstrate that “details matter”: “Discussing the subject in generalities, using ambiguous language or hyperbole will almost certainly lead to the wrong outcome.”</p> <p><strong>The fear and fury is genuine</strong></p> <p>In a way, this is a powerful rhetorical move. Insisting that the conversation focus on the details is an insistence that people who dismiss client-side scanning on principle are wrong to do so: if you believe that privacy of private communications is and should be an inviolable right, then Levy and Robinson are effectively arguing that you be cut out of the conversation in favour of more moderate people who are willing to discuss trade-offs.</p> <p>But it is frustrating that much of the response has been the same generalities that accompanied Apple’s announcement a year ago. Technology news site the Register, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/22/british_encryption_scanning/\">published a furious editorial saying</a>: “The same argument has been used many times before, usually against one of the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse: terrorists, drug dealers, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and organized crime.”</p> <p>I’ve spent enough time talking to people who work in child protection to know that the fear and fury about the harm caused by some of the world’s largest companies is genuine, regardless of whether you think it is correctly targeted. I don’t claim to know Levy and Robinson’s motivations, but this paper represents an effort to create conversation, rather than continue with a shouting match between two irreconcilable sides of an argument. It deserves to be treated as such.</p> <h2><strong>It’s not ‘yourscraft’</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58a27c18e9876fc8f8d855a19871ac6cf9ecded3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58a27c18e9876fc8f8d855a19871ac6cf9ecded3/711_913_3693_2216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What’s Minecraft is mine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What’s Minecraft is mine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Bardgett/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Minecraft is big. You might have heard of it. So when the game makes a moderation decision, it’s a bit more important than when Bungie decided to nerf scout rifles in Destiny 2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jul/21/minecraft-developers-wont-allow-nfts-on-gaming-platform\">Particularly when the moderation decision is this</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Minecraft will not allow non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be used on the popular gaming platform, with the company describing them as antithetical to Minecraft’s “values of creative inclusion and playing together”.</em></p> <p><em>Minecraft represented an attractive potential market for NFTs, with a user base – estimated at more than 141 million by August 2021 – already engaged in sharing unique digital items developed for the game.</em></p> <p><em>But the Microsoft-owned development studio behind Minecraft, Mojang, has put an end to speculation NFTs could be allowed in the game. In a blog post on Wednesday, the developers said blockchain technology was not permitted, stating it was antithetical to Minecraft’s values.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Minecraft’s incredible success is thanks to its extendability. As well as the built-in creative aspects of the game – often described as the 21st century’s answer to Lego – users can modify it in ways large and small, producing new experiences. That flexibility proved tempting for NFT creators, who settled on the idea of creating new features in Minecraft and selling them as digital assets.</p> <p>In theory, it’s the perfect NFT opportunity: a digital-native creation, with a use-case that is actually achievable, and a demonstrably viable market. Startups flocked to the field: NFT Worlds sells pre-generated Minecraft landscapes, on which people would be able to build experiences and resell them for profit; Gridcraft operates a Minecraft server with its own crypto-based economy.</p> <p>Or they did. Now, it seems, NFTs have become such a toxic phenomenon that even passive acceptance is too much for a company like Mojang.

Paul Fletcher, a Liberal moderate who survived the May election rout, is now manager of opposition business. Fletcher opened Wednesday cranky, and his mood did not improve.</p> \n<p>He collided early with the iron-clad law that politics is a numbers game. Labor had resolved to change the standing orders to give more questions to the crossbench and fewer to the opposition. That tweak reflected the brutal representational mathematics of the May election, the conscious uncoupling of the Liberal party and its progressive heartland.</p> \n<p>Augmenting Fletcher’s outrage at the shrinking number of questions was umbrage at the evils of a new government truncating debate. “Indeed, [with] this standing order, Mr Speaker, we will be right up there with the Russian Duma as a toothless legislative body,” Fletcher said. It was a rhetorical flourish which possibly sounded more plausible during rehearsal than it did on the floor of the House of Representatives. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/australia-inflation-rate-abs-june-quarter-increase-australian-bureau-statistics-reserve-bank-rba\">Australia’s inflation rate reaches 6.1% – the fastest annual increase in 21 years</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Fletcher’s performative effrontery about the standing orders was the warmup to the first question time of the 47th parliament. It was standing room only for the hour of glower in the House of Representatives at 2pm.</p> \n<p>Anthony Albanese’s partner, Jodie, and son, Nathan, sat ringside. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, hovered above the chamber in the visitors gallery like visiting minor royalty. </p> \n<p>On the day Australia recorded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/australia-inflation-rate-abs-june-quarter-increase-australian-bureau-statistics-reserve-bank-rba\">fastest annual rate of growth in consumer prices</a> for more than 20 years, one might have expected the opposition to test the prime minister’s mettle on inflation, that being the water cooler issue.</p> \n<p>But no. It was too soon. </p> \n<p>Given the Coalition was in power for the nine years leading up to 21 May, Wednesday’s inflation was, more than plausibly, the Coalition’s inflation. Peter Dutton, it seemed, did not want to chance his arm on Albanese’s responsibility for the soaring price of lettuce, given the tables would not only be turned, they’d be loaded into a slingshot and propelled across the chamber.</p> \n<p>The new shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, however, is a confident soul and he did chance his arm with energy prices. Would Albanese stand by the claims in his pre-election modelling that power prices would come down as a consequence of the government’s climate and energy policies?</p> \n<p>The prime minister felt zero pressure to answer. He vaulted cleanly over Taylor’s proposition by unfurling the Greatest Hits of Angus, including the extraordinary decision of the former energy minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/coalition-delayed-news-that-electricity-prices-are-set-to-rise-until-after-federal-election\">to delay an important electricity pricing update until after the election</a>, which left Australian voters in the dark about looming increases in their power bills. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/01/well-done-me-angus-taylor-praises-himself-as-fantastic-in-twitter-fail\">“Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus.”</a>)</p> \n<p>Safer for Dutton was some base-pleasing obscurantism. Perhaps a gentle hat tip to the remaining members of <a href=\"https://www.hrnicholls.com.au/\">the HR Nicholls Society</a>.</p> \n<p>Australia’s alternative prime minister dived under the inconvenient tsunami of the Coalition’s record by sharing dark prophesies of a construction union that would now run rampant across the land because the new Labor regime had gutted the Australian Building and Construction Commission.</p> \n<p>Solid, three-star Howard-era stuff. Albanese rewarded this predictability by smiling benignly across the dispatch box and schooling the Liberal leader about the trying vocation of opposition. “I wish him well,” the prime minister said, pausing for a beat, “and I hope he stays there for a very long time”.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As the various mini-reckonings and micro-dramas played out, the chamber was quieter than usual. Perhaps the government held its collective breath until Albanese demonstrated he’d done his homework, and therefore wasn’t going to wing it. Early forays signalled he was across the detail; even armed with pre-packaged zingers. New ministers experimented with their scripts, finding their métier. The new elevations clutched their question time brief folders like flotation devices.</p> \n<p>The new Speaker, Milton Dick, made it clear he was no Tony Smith – although perhaps even Tony Smith wasn’t Tony Smith on day one. Perhaps Smith’s audacity as an independent chamber arbiter grew in increments over time.</p> \n<p>The key moment of the first question time came when the home affairs minister, Claire O’Neil, should have been shut down by the Speaker, but wasn’t.</p> \n<p>O’Neil accused Karen Andrews of an “act of cowardice” on election day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/22/disgraceful-report-reveals-morrison-government-pressured-border-force-to-promote-election-day-boat-arrival\">when Australian Border Force was pressured</a> to draft and issue a statement about an asylum seeker boat interception before the operation had even finished.</p> \n<p><em>Cowardice</em> was a clear reflection on Andrews. The standing orders deem such reflections disorderly. Fletcher doubled down on his performative high dudgeon. Umbrage ensued. Smith would have required O’Neil to withdraw. But the new Speaker was unperturbed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>O’Neil, who lacks the chamber experience of some of her peers, could have lost concentration in the melee.

A librarian interviewed me in an elegant amphitheater in front of Kansas City residents. We spoke about immigration, politics and the climate crisis and managed to laugh a lot too. Some audience members challenged my views, and we talked it out right there. We had a frank and fun conversation in a public space, free to all, and streamed live for people who couldn’t make it to the library that day. I only later thought about how rare that is – and how profound.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/15/a-chicago-story-with-lessons-for-libraries-everywhere\">A Chicago story with lessons for libraries everywhere |  Kenan Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Libraries are this quiet, powerful space that are just always there, right?” Lessa Kanani’opua Pelayo-Lozada told me. She is a librarian and was elected president of the American Library Association (ALA) earlier this year. “We are that constant, for everyone. We’re here, and we’re not going anywhere.”</p> <p>Pelayo-Lozada is taking on the role at a time when the right has intensified an orchestrated assault on books, intellectual freedom and, of course, libraries. In her words, it’s “a political, concerted, organized attack that makes it hard for us to do our jobs”.</p> <p>The ALA has been tracking bans for two decades and reported that 2021 was the worst year for attempted censorship yet, with 1,597 books challenged. As long as there have been books, there has been censorship. Often censorship is demanded under cover of vague “public decency” concerns, but the truth is these are simply a veil over a darker motive – silencing unwanted perspectives and protecting the status quo.</p> <p>We see this play out in today’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/books/book-ban-us-schools.html\">move to ban books</a>, with many of them about LGBTQ+ rights or racism, often written by people of color. I asked Pelayo-Lozado why she thinks this is happening. “Our goal as libraries is to empower our users; to empower them for critical thinking, to empower them to make their dreams come true. And that can be scary to folks who maybe don’t want everyone to be in power, who want to have power over others.”</p> <p>As the Guardian has reported, the censorship frequently pushed by conservative groups is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/us-conservatives-campaign-books-ban-schools\">linked to wealthy rightwing donors</a> even as they masquerade as grassroots efforts, with names like “Moms for Liberty” and “Parents Defending Education”. EveryLibrary, a political action committee for libraries, reports that many states have passed laws to change how libraries handle complaints about books, making it easier to remove them. Republican legislators, who loudly claim they are all for freedom of speech, are working to change how library board members are appointed and challenging laws that protect librarians and teachers from prosecution should they be accused of sharing something someone could find offensive.</p> <p>The battle against intellectual freedom has escalated from the legal into the physical world. Twenty masked neo-Nazis recently protested outside a library in Boston hosting a Drag Queen Story Hour event. Last November, members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group, showed up at a school board meeting in Downers Grove in Illinois. There, they jeered at students arguing for their right to read Gender Queer, an autobiography about the nonbinary author Maia Kobabe’s journey of gender identity as a teenager and one of the books targeted by conservatives nationwide.</p> <p>Are they so frightened of young people reading about someone else’s life experience? I think the right wing is really afraid of libraries not because libraries promote any one type of information but because libraries promote information itself.</p> <p>“Our core is figuring out how to provide information and providing access to information, in whatever form that looks like – whether it’s paper, whether it’s audiobooks, whether it’s digital literacy, we are here for that,” Pelayo-Lozado said. She believes this mission and libraries’ stated core values of democracy and diversity are what is so challenging to some. “We are trained to make knowledge and ideas available so that everybody has the freedom to choose what to read.”</p> <p>Hannah Arendt deeply understood fascists and their fear of a well-informed and independent-minded population. As she put it: “There are no dangerous thoughts for the simple reason that thinking itself is such a dangerous enterprise.”</p> <p>Libraries help us to think. That is why they are powerful, and that is why they are under attack. That is also why we must protect them.</p> <ul> <li><p>Maeve Higgins is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/27/equality-is-personal-for-me-stonewall-chair-facing-whispering-campaign","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T10:15:59Z","webTitle":"‘Equality is personal for me’: UK watchdog frontrunner faces whispering campaign","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/equality-is-personal-for-me-stonewall-chair-facing-whispering-campaign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/27/equality-is-personal-for-me-stonewall-chair-facing-whispering-campaign","fields":{"headline":"‘Equality is personal for me’: UK watchdog frontrunner faces whispering campaign","trailText":"Sheldon Mills, the crusading lawyer and chair of Stonewall, is being targeted over trans issues as he runs to lead the Competition and Markets Authority","byline":"Rupert Neate and Kalyeena Makortoff","body":"<p>At secondary school in the Cardiff suburb of Ely, Sheldon Mills told his history teacher that he wanted to study law at King’s College London and become a lawyer in the capital.</p> <p>The teacher, whom Mills has declined to identify, replied: “You will never go to King’s College, Sheldon.”</p> <p>Mills went to King’s College, where he obtained both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, becoming only the second person from his school to go to university. He then went on to become a solicitor working in competition law for big City law firms, before taking top jobs at regulators the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p> <p>Now Mills is understood to be a frontrunner to become chief executive of the CMA. But some ministers are said to be reluctant to sign off on his appointment to the £195,000-a-year job because of his support for transgender and queer people through his role as chair of trustees of Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ charity.</p> <p>According to the Telegraph, a government source said: “We want to avoid a politically controversial candidate such as Sheldon. We’ve just persuaded them [the CMA] to stop paying money to Stonewall. The last thing we need is a chief executive who is a paid-up supporter. We won’t have him.”</p> <p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which is overseeing the appointment, declined to comment. A spokesperson declined to distance the department from the comments provided to the Telegraph.</p> <p>Mills is competing for the job against the CMA’s current interim chief executive, Sarah Cardell. But Cardell, who previously served as one of the CMA’s top lawyers, is also reportedly facing opposition from Tories who worry she would be too interventionist.</p> <p>The concern, apparently, is that she would continue the trend set under the outgoing boss, Andrea Coscelli, who has taken aim at a range of firms across industries including immigration to tech and fashion.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the watchdog raided the offices of outsourcer Mitie over a contract linked to immigration removal centres, and a month earlier fined JD Sports and Footasylum £5m for anti-competitive behaviour that included clandestine meetings between their chairmen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/jd-sports-and-footasylum-fined-almost-5m-for-breaching-cma-order\">in a Manchester car park. </a>It followed an order that forced Facebook’s parent company to sell their gif creation website, and fines against pharmaceutical companies for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/15/uk-drug-companies-fined-260m-overcharging-nhs\">overcharging the NHS for tablets.</a></p> <p>Mills has already shown he is ready to take a tough stance against wayward firms, and on Tuesday morning was fielding questions from reporters about the launch of the FCA’s new so-called consumer duty, which makes senior bosses accountable for protecting everyday retail investors. It is one of the biggest projects he has led since his appointment to the regulator in late 2020.</p> <p>He made his mark last spring, pushing through a ban on so-called loyalty penalties across the insurance sector, meaning existing customers would no longer be charged more than new policyholders. The ban, understood to be Mills’s proudest achievement at the FCA to date, is expected to save consumers about £4.2bn over the next 10 years.</p> <p>Mills, who is gay and black, is the longest serving trustee at Stonewall having joined in 2013 after attending its leadership programme course while working at the OFT.</p> <p>“LGBT equality is really personal for me,” <a href=\"https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/meet-sheldon-mills-stonewalls-new-chair-trustees\">he said in an interview for Stonewall when he was appointed chair of trustees in 2020</a>. “For most of my life, I’ve dealt with feeling that I’m different from the rest of society.</p> <p>“Being LGBT is part of this, but it’s also because I come from a mixed heritage background and was one of the first in my family to go to university. Trying to find my place in the world as an outsider taught me a lot, but also took an incredible amount of energy.</p> <p>“I want to do all that I can to make sure LGBT people feel free to be themselves in all areas of their life, all the time.”</p> <p>Mills said his proudest moment at Stonewall was when the charity moved to fully support trans people. “When Stonewall moved to become trans-inclusive it was a huge moment and I’m so grateful I was a part of making this happen.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mills has said that growing up he didn’t worry about identifying as gay. “I was so out it was ridiculous,” <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08vspdh\">he said in BBC Wales documentary Black and Welsh</a> in 2020. He said the black community supported him as a gay man and he experienced no homophobia at all from them. However, he suffered abuse from others, and said that spurred him on in his career.</p> <p>He said being underestimated by his teacher, and others since then, had spurred him on. “That’s what saddens me,” he said. “Not just for me, for all black boys really, and it’s why I do the work at Stonewall, it’s why I’m a visible black role model in the professional work I do.</p> <p>“Role models shouldn’t just be movie stars or singers or athletes.

They lost three of their final 22 games and if they continue where they left off they will give a few rivals a bloody nose. Liam Rosenior, for now interim manager, has spoken about <strong>Derby</strong>, back at this level for the first time since 1986, needing to “microwave the process” such has been the speed of the turnaround, from bedevilled to blessed in the space of a few summer days. Led by their 37-year-old captain, Curtis Davies, who played every minute last season, Derby have the hallmarks of a team that could be a class apart – a promising blend of youth and experience – but some are light on match fitness. If Michael Duff can breathe life back into <strong>Barnsley</strong> then they will threaten, though a fast start is a big ask given more regulars may head for the exit door. Last season was disastrous but Duff looks a savvy appointment and if James Norwood can deliver up front, they could mean business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74de71f6d1781cf0ae534f578dfc7d8a739dbd91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74de71f6d1781cf0ae534f578dfc7d8a739dbd91/0_151_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Ainsworth sings the national anthem with his Wycombe players before the League One playoff final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Ainsworth, who took Wycombe to the League One playoff final last season, has extended his contract.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Wycombe </strong>made it to Wembley last season and will again prove tough to beat. Gareth Ainsworth, who will celebrate a decade in charge in September, would not have extended his contract if he did not think he could seal a Championship return. <strong>Portsmouth </strong>have flattered to deceive but the arrival of Joe Pigott and Colby Bishop from division rivals, plus Michael Morrison on a free, should help them push on. <strong>Plymouth</strong> and <strong>Oxford</strong> will do well to match their finishes of seventh and eighth respectively but the former will be enhanced by a trio of exciting loans and the latter by the former Cardiff winger Josh Murphy. Bishop joined Pompey from <strong>Accrington</strong>, who are part of the furniture these days. This is their fifth straight season at this level and despite losing important players a third consecutive top-half finish is doable, though anything more will be a stretch. And for <strong>Charlton </strong>it was a trip to Wernham Hogg this summer, with no fewer than four arrivals from Swindon, including the head coach, Ben Garner, and Ghana’s No 1, Jojo Wollacott, but improvements are required if they are to break into the top 10.</p> <h2>Relegation candidates</h2> <p>The landscape of fallen giants is not the nicest for Wade Elliott as he takes his first steps as a manager at <strong>Cheltenham</strong>, who finished 15th last season, their highest position. Gloucestershire neighbours <strong>Forest Green</strong> are also victims of their own success, having lost the head coach, Rob Edwards, and cogs Kane Wilson, Ebou Adams and Nicky Cadden since promotion from League Two, and top scorer Matty Stevens is sidelined after knee surgery. <strong>Exeter </strong>have long been comfortable promoting from within but a new goalkeeper in Jamal Blackman represents the only addition to their squad and staying up looks a daunting prospect. <strong>Port</strong> <strong>Vale</strong> and <strong>Bristol Rovers </strong>may be the best equipped to cope with the step up, though neither have wowed with their summer business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c66bf40dba6bcd3fb06ff6f9a50062a7a4d39acf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c66bf40dba6bcd3fb06ff6f9a50062a7a4d39acf/0_46_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morecambe’s Cole Stockton shoots in their FA Cup tie against Spurs last season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Morecambe be able to keep striker Cole Stockton?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Optimism abounds at <strong>Fleetwood, </strong>who have given another Marmite midfielder his first managerial job, with the former Celtic captain Scott Brown taking the reins and the 30-year-old former Shrewsbury defender Joe Riley appointed head of recruitment.

For <strong>Morecambe</strong>, it will be a case of how they cope with the inevitable, with Cole Stockton keen to depart after a prolific campaign, but Derek Adams may find a recipe to keep them up. <strong>Shrewsbury </strong>tailed off but Steve Cotterill has strengthened, creating cause for optimism, and <strong>Cambridge’s </strong>battle to avoid second-season syndrome is largely contingent on the arrival of hungry youngsters. <strong>Burton </strong>bombed towards the end of last season and must hope Victor Adeboyejo solves their goalscoring troubles.</p> <h2>Three youngsters to watch</h2> <p><strong>Luca Connell, 21, Barnsley </strong>After leaving Celtic without a first-team appearance, Connell returns to England hoping to kickstart his career.

And sure enough, the collection includes an unpublished gem: My Autobiography, a 150-page memoir composed in the years before he began work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/13/bishop-lowell-poetry-review\" title=\"\">Life Studies</a>, his landmark volume of poems from 1959. Those familiar with the poetry will recognise the common characters: Lowell’s maternal grandfather, a retired mining engineer, who sits “like Lear at the head of the table”; Lowell’s mother, who’d been happiest when she was engaged but not yet married, when she was still her father’s favourite daughter; Lowell senior, an unassuming naval officer, always relegated to the corner of family portraits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/mar/01/robert-lowell-at-100-poetry-centenary\">Robert Lowell at 100: why his poetry has never been more relevant</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The young poet, Bobby to his parents, is besieged from his earliest waking moments by the sense of having been born late in an aristocratic New England household: “Nothing from now on was to go quite as expected …” Once, his mother chided him when he was sick for being “a design for mourning”. Decades later, he would end up as the family’s designated mourner.Bobby escaped the monotony of his parents’ ill-suited marriage by pretending to like everything his mother didn’t, and by running away on weekends and holidays to his grandfather’s sprawling farm south of Boston. Impressions come thick and fast in this account of a fairly unmomentous childhood. Commander Billy Harkness is a frequent guest, who likes nothing more than to sprawl back on an armchair with a drink and recount his seafaring exploits. The unmarried Old Aunt Sarah is the “loveliest person in the world”, but sometimes locks herself in her bedroom to memorise a chapter from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/04/book-beach-the-count-of-monte-cristo-alexandre-dumas\" title=\"\">The Count of Monte Cristo</a>. Above all, there is asthmatic little Bobby, who half-listens to his father fret about stepping down from his naval role, or stares up at his Mayflower ancestors’ portraits above the dining table, and wants excitedly “to make life stop”.</p> <p>Lowell’s memories are at once vivid and listless. Sentences are tinged with the desperation of a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown, holding on to flashbacks of more placid days. All through his life he experienced spells of mania and depression and was hospitalised multiple times. Another portion of memoir, The Balanced Aquarium, describes his stay in a psychiatric facility in New York weeks after his mother’s death. The tribulations of his fellow patients are interspersed with painful images from his parents’ final moments, and older snapshots from his idyllic boyhood, now cast in a tragic light. In his poem Sailing Home from Rapallo, Lowell describes his mother’s last name being misspelled on her coffin. He recounts the same episode here, but the moment feels just as shattering without line breaks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He didn’t see the antisemitic Ezra Pound ‘as a bad man, except in the ways we all are’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book is rounded out by a dozen or so vignettes of fellow poets and friends. Lowell seems buoyant and chattier in these pieces, unburdened by the weight of being custodian of his family’s secrets. At the same time, each essay becomes an occasion for a new self-portrait. We encounter Lowell as the apprentice writer who once pitched a tent on a lawn outside the poet Allen Tate’s house in rural Tennessee and stayed for three months; then as the professor who counted among his students a twentysomething <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/23/arielsylvia-plath-100-best-nonfiction-books-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">Sylvia Plath</a>, and later observed in her posthumous Ariel poems a precision so overwhelming it made him want to give up writing at once.</p> <p>In Lowell’s obituary of Arendt, which he had agonised over in the letter to Bishop, he regretted not speaking up while her book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/hannah-arendt-adolf-eichmann-banality-of-evil\" title=\"\">Eichmann in Jerusalem</a> was accused of “victim-blaming” in New York literary circles. Arendt’s exhortations were, in the end, “too heroic to live with, for nearly all of us are cowards if sufficiently squeezed by the hand of the powerful”. Lowell wasn’t much of a stickler for political clarity – in himself, or in his acquaintances. On his first visit to Tate’s house, he noticed a Confederate flag hanging over the fireplace, but that didn’t stop him from returningto camp on his lawn a second time. He didn’t see the antisemitic Ezra Pound “as a bad man, except in the ways we all are”. He recognised the polemical underpinnings of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/27/posthumous-cantos-ezra-pound-massimo-bacigalupo-review\" title=\"\">Cantos</a>, but still felt it was Pound’s best work.

I first heard of them from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/into-the-inferno-review-werner-herzog-peers-into-the-depths-of-the-volcano\">Werner Herzog’s film Into the Inferno</a>.</p> <p>But where Herzog’s film has something dispassionate, almost fatalistic in its awe in the face of the volcano’s terrifying power, this film looks for something romantic, celebrating or consecrating the myth of the Kraffts: they loved each other, they loved volcanoes and it all came together on that terrible day. Maurice in fact often casually talked about the probability of dying in a volcano eruption – although the film shows him talking about it happening to him, not to both of them together. Did they really, in their hearts, think that it could happen? Or did their lifelong acclimatisation to danger inoculate them against that thought?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_7XADmKVL0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-_7XADmKVL0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Either way, this film shows how their buccaneering volcanology was born decades before in the countercultural spirit of the late 60s – they were the new generation challenging the placid dullness of scientific work. They soon learned to distinguish between two different sorts of volcano. The “red” type, with its mighty red rivers of lava was paradoxically less dangerous than the “grey” type with its explosive detonation of dull ash, rocks and dust, which could swallow you up in a moment – which is what happened to the Kraffts in Unzen.</p> <p>They really were amazing personalities: almost like children, although they came to be depressed that their work was not inspiring governments to work on evacuation protocols. Perhaps Herzog understood something about the Kraffts that this film doesn’t quite, for all its fascination: the element of the danger cult, or death cult, in their work.

My favourite storyline was Sonia’s death. Even typing this now brings a lump to my throat. The acting by Eve Morey (Sonia) and Ryan Moloney (Toadie) was outstanding; the way they exuded every emotion of those who go through a terminal illness was gut-wrenchingly beautiful.

I’ve watched it for as long as I can remember; it has been with me through school and university to now being a “proper” grownup. There is a real community online around the show, which has only grown in the past few years. Neighbours can handle serious and silly storylines in equal measure and will leave a void when it has gone. As a standout moment from the show, the two-hander between Jackie Woodburne (Susan Kennedy) and Finn Kelly (Rob Mills) was a masterstroke: claustrophobic, tense and so well acted, straight off the back of a week of special episodes to celebrate the show’s 35th year. <strong>Guy, 42, charity worker, Peterborough</strong></p> <h2>‘It has been a constant and a comfort’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3dbb9546790d8fafb8b68427aa1c51c881a7290\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3dbb9546790d8fafb8b68427aa1c51c881a7290/0_0_720_431/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tim’s picture of Ramsay Street, where Neighbours is set\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim’s picture of Ramsay Street, where Neighbours is set.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neighbours has been a constant and a comfort throughout my life. No matter how dark real life became, there was always a safe space to escape to; a reminder of the good in people, of the values of friendship, hope, possibility and positivity.

When we went to Australia in 2002, we took a big detour to Melbourne to visit Ramsay Street and go to the Neighbours Night – where we met Karl, Steph and Darcy. The moment that most sticks in my head from the show is when Drew died – it was devastating. It has always been there. It has always made me happy.

My earliest memory of Neighbours is the coffee shop being blown up and Harold helping to save Des Clarke. I also really enjoyed the Susan/Karl/Izzy storyline, as well as when Susan found out she had multiple sclerosis. There are so many noteworthy storylines. The show will be really missed. <strong>Calvin, 39, Nottinghamshire</strong></p> <h2>‘I enjoy escaping to sunshine and attractive people’</h2> <p>I watched Neighbours in the beginning and over the years I’ve dipped in and out, but have been consistently watching for the past five or six years.

Yes, storylines can be predictable and ridiculous, but there’s humour as well – and things are resolved fairly quickly. I will really miss Neighbours.

But you need to bear in mind that the special measure was left in place for about 14 years.

Tink presents herself “not as a politician per se but as a proud parliamentarian, elected by the people of North Sydney to ensure our community’s voice is heard loud and clear”.<br><br>She says it was “notable” that “nowhere in [the constitution] was there any use of the word ‘party’”.<br> <br>Tink said that for too long the North Sydney community’s desire for policies including greater green space have been written off as those of “pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies” or “inner-city raving lunatics”. She said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Criticisms that we initially found curious but which we ultimately realised were indicative of a far greater level of disconnect and basic disdain for our community. Hear me when I say: the people of North Sydney want politics done differently. I stand before you today as the elected representative of a vibrant and diverse community that draws in people from all backgrounds and ages ... We recognise we are at a tipping point – on climate, integrity, equality and fundamentally in politics and we can see the potential to do better.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In particular, Tink cited treatment of refugees as an area we can do better:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is not enough for us to continue to spruik the idea of Australia as the lucky country: not when 30,000 people continue to reside here as part of an appalling “illegal immigration legacy caseload”. Our current laws are preventing these people from planning beyond five- or three-year intervals. They cannot be reunited with the family they may have left behind, and yet the children that came with them know nothing of life in any other country. Indeed, they are Australian in every way, yet because of the decisions of past governments they are currently told they will never qualify for Australian citizenship. We have already heard much talk about the extraordinary gift that is Australia’s multicultural reality and of the courage it takes to run with your family from imminent threat. <strong>I would challenge us as a parliament to strive to truly do better in the area of human rights. True refugees deserve our compassion, not our disdain.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Tink spoke about the need to do more for young people and mental health:<em><br></em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We must also look beyond what has been done to date to identify underlying systemic issues driving phenomena like the unprecedented levels of mental distress across our country. Recent studies indicate that approximately one in five teens suffer from at least one diagnosable mental health disorder, and that the teen mental health crisis continues to grow ... We must do everything we can to build resilience in our children from their earliest ages and teach them how to ask for help. At the same time, we must build up support for those that are currently seen as the missing middle: perhaps struggling but not acute.

Water is the lifeblood of rural and regional Australia and water management in a region where rainfall is inconsistent is even more important. When you add water, everything grows – populations, economies and opportunities. To borrow a quote from my parliamentary colleague, Barnaby Joyce, “water is the currency, and a dam is the bank”.

Hecs is largely responsible for that. Amongst younger Australians, the percentage is even higher, more than 43% of younger Australians have a university degree. But that figure hides another fact – that is the fact that kids from poorer families are less likely to go to preschool, less likely to finish high school and are less likely to get a university degree. </p> \n   <p>Where you live also matters. My friends on both sides of the House of Representatives in regional areas will know this. About 48% of young people in our major cities have university degrees but the percentage in regional Australia is about 20%, and for our Indigenous brothers and sisters that percentage is even lower, something like less than 10% of Indigenous Australians have a university degree. </p> \n   <p>We have got to do something about that.

Marshall doesn’t answer that directly but instead discusses industry and innovation:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Wherever we can, we step in to help industry be more environmentally sustainable than they have been in the past … I grew up in an era where industry and environment were competitors. A lot of the science that CSIRO has been focused on in the last seven years has been around breaking that paradigm. We found industry is willing to change their practices if we can show them another way. Australian science, through things like FutureFeed, completely broke that nexus in. Getting rid of emissions from cattle seemed impossible until science could solve it and make it possible – it is not economically better but industry is doing it because it is the right thing to do … </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e891c96ab7c08a001240de0fe3f155131a09216\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e891c96ab7c08a001240de0fe3f155131a09216/0_0_6931_4621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry Marshall at the National Press Club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry Marshall speaks at the National Press Club.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Marshall is asked whether the CSIRO supports the idea of Australia having its own Silicon Valley. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We shouldn’t copy Silicon Valley. Place-based innovation has its place. What is remarkable about Australia: FutureFeed was invented in Townsville, not in a big city, in Townsville. It was tested in another part of northern Queensland and eastern Victoria. I think the wave of the future is in a network. It is getting the brightest minds in the country together and technology enables us to do that in a way that Silicon Valley couldn’t have done back then. We are different … Silicon Valley did amazing things but they missed agriculture and food as an investment area. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There are multiple questions about China and geopolitics. Marshall is asked about Chinese collaboration and suggestions that CSIRO scientists have accepted Chinese Thousand Talents Plan scholarships. He says he is not aware of any instances of foreign interference or theft:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In terms of the Thousand Talents program, I don’t believe that any CSIRO person has been part of that program.

As a nation, we haven’t always done this well. We spent 50 years understanding climate change. But we haven’t invested in the large-scale transformative change that we now so desperately need to limit its impact. </p> \n   <p>This failure to act is an uncomfortable and costly truth.

In Australia, heat-related deaths are expected to grow by 60% by 2050, with Perth forecast to be the worst hit. In 2020, there were 673 heat-related deaths in Perth. That is forecast to be 1,400 lives lost every year by 2050 in one Australian city …</p> \n   <p><strong>The uncomfortable truth is the world has missed its opportunity to limit dangerous climate change within this century </strong>... we must adapt to a changing climate while we wait for the world to reduce its emissions. We need to adapt our healthcare system, our critical infrastructure, our settlement patterns and our disaster preparedness.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Megatrend #2: “leaner, cleaner and greener”</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Australia has ridden the wave of fossil fuels for 30 years but it is time to catch a new wave: renewables. They will account for 80% of the growth in global electricity demand by 2030.

Growing resistance to antibiotics is another significant threat to human health, already responsible for 1.27 million deaths per year worldwide. More than 11 million Australians suffer from chronic disease.

Human rights groups and lawyers said they had been pressuring countries behind the scenes not to accept him and, according to reports, the US embassy declined to give him a visa. The US was seen to be Rajapaksa’s favoured final destination as his son and grandchild live there and he is a former citizen.</p> \n<p>It had also been reported that he intended to travel to the United Arab Emirates, long seen as a favoured destination for disgraced and exiled leaders and where the Rajapaksa family reportedly have assets.</p> \n<p>But speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the cabinet spokesperson Bandula Gunawardana gave the strongest indication yet that Rajapaksa intended to return to Sri Lanka.

He gave no timeline for Rajapaksa’s expected return.</p> \n<p>Rajapaksa’s decision to come back could also be linked to the new government in charge.

He has the backing of the Rajapaksas’ political party and has a cabinet filled with figures who served under the former president. Many are unconvinced that, even though Rajapaksa no longer has immunity from protection, the Wickremesinghe government will investigate and hold the former president accountable, as protesters on the streets have been calling for.</p> \n<p>On his return to the country Rajapaksa is also likely to face considerable anger from the public who ousted him. He stands accused of economic mismanagement and divisive politics that led to Sri Lanka’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/sri-lanka-unrest-new-president-crackdown-protests\">worst economic crisis since independence</a>, with food and fuel shortages crippling the island, and a key demand of the protest movement is that he and his family are investigated for corruption.</p> \n<p>In a sign of what could await him if he returns, on Wednesday Sri Lanka’s supreme court issued a notice for Rajapaksa to make submissions by 1 August on various petitions calling for accountability for those responsible for the country’s economic crash.</p> \n<p>Rajapaksa has made no public statement or address since he left the country. His older brother Mahinda, the former president and prime minister, remains in the country, as do his younger brother Basil, the former finance minister; other members of the Rajapaksa family who served in government, and his nephew Namal Rajapaksa, who is considered the political heir apparent of the family.

A few months ago, he said that VAT on energy bills would disproportionately help richer people; it wasn’t targeted enough at people who are vulnerable and that’s why he decided not to go with it.

The interview got off to a bad start when I asked her the seemingly innocuous question: “Can women ever achieve equality with men?” The women’s game was some way off achieving parity with the men’s, she told me.</p> <p>Seven years later, this is still the case (but they did also have a 50-year head start – more on that later). But what she really seemed frustrated by, I sensed, were the constant comparisons with the men’s game. Could we not “appreciate [women’s football] in its own right”, she asked, and recognise it as “a great product” regardless?</p> <p>As a young and idealistic reporter, I struggled to understand Hayes’ point. Surely this was internalised misogyny speaking? Women’s football was gaining in popularity, so why should its players be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/26/football-gender-pay-gap-worse-than-in-politics-medicine-and-space\">grateful for being paid</a> the London living wage, when male footballers were taking home as much as £200,000 a week?</p> <p>But as time has gone on, I’ve started to understand what she meant. There is value in recognising the women’s game as a separate product, because it <em>is </em>a different product, and in that respect it presents different opportunities. For a start, the women’s game hasn’t been corrupted by money, or mired in accusations of misconduct or toxic fan culture, and we can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/01/crowds-womens-football\">prevent it heading</a> in the same direction as the men’s game.</p> <p>It is also undeniably a more family-friendly environment, and it is a delight to see so many young women and girls in the crowds flocking to the Women’s Euro. I would be surprised, for example, to find any fans so<em> </em>drunk at a women’s football match that they wound up falling on top of the people in the row in front of them, as I experienced at the League One play-off final in 2019.</p> <p>This year’s Women’s Euro has seen record upon record broken in terms of attendance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/26/such-a-joy-viewing-parties-for-womens-euros-score-with-football-fans\">and viewers</a>, and right now women’s football at international level is an unstoppable force. The quality and talent displayed during the tournament has been immense, not least that of the Lionesses in their 4-0 semi-final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/jul/26/england-v-sweden-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-live\">win against Sweden</a>. Sure, there have been some less exciting games, but let’s not pretend the same can’t be said of men’s football. </p> <p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/19/womens-super-league-kick-off-winter-new-season\">2017 relaunch</a> of the professionalised Women’s Super League – a move, some argue, designed to embarrass some of England’s top clubs into making a public commitment to the women’s game – some have moved towards the “#oneclub” approach: if you value your club, you value all the teams within it equally.</p> <p>It’s a lovely idea in theory, if fans actually sign up to it, but let’s not pretend football is an equal opportunities sport between men and women – we need to hold the games up against each other in order to acknowledge these disparities.</p> <p>It also means that the difference between men’s and women’s football is valued less – “#NotWomensFootball” the Volkswagen adverts at this summer’s tournament state, but why isn’t it? By positioning women’s teams as some sort of spin-off of big Premier League clubs we’re not really encouraging people to appreciate it as a “great product” in its own right, and there are a fair few aspects of the men’s game we wouldn’t actually want to emulate.</p> <p>That said, there’s no perfect solution. Treating the women’s game as a separate product also opens it up to the heavy weight of expectations heaped upon women across society. Why is the women’s game seen as more “family friendly”? Because women are softer? Less prone to diving, swearing and backchatting the ref? (Just ask Spain’s <a href=\"https://www.givemesport.com/88036929-euro-2022-spanish-sub-misa-rodriguez-booked-after-embarrassing-touchline-outburst\">Misa Rodriguez</a> about that.) Even in this year’s Women’s Euro, commentators have asserted that it is unusual for female players to conduct themselves in this manner.</p> <p>You only need to look at the criticism the Arsenal Women’s players received when they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/06/fa-will-not-discipline-arsenal-women-trio-for-dubai-trip-in-tier-4\">travelled to Dubai</a> in January 2021 at the height of the tier 4 Covid restrictions to see how we view female players. We simply expect better from them than their male counterparts. They are expected to act as ambassadors for the game rather than just rock up with a Gucci washbag and some AirPods, play football and trot off again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/26/england-sweden-womens-euro-2022-semi-final\">No angst, no heartache but full of risk: this is an England team like no other  | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the undeniable elephant in the room when it comes to women’s football, and one of the main issues with the “one club” approach, is that women still take home a tiny fraction of what male players earn at comparable levels, and investment in the women’s game is vastly inferior. Paradoxically, this seems to be the root cause of why the women’s game is favoured by some, and also why women’s and men’s football will never be equally revered. Men rage on social media that “WOMEN CAN’T FILL STADIUMS”, which might be true, but little is done to address why.</p> <p>In 1921, the FA voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/13/how-the-fa-banned-womens-football-in-1921-and-tried-to-justify-it\">ban women’s football</a>, deeming the game to be “quite unsuitable for females”. Just a year before, the women’s game was enjoying record success, with 53,000 supporters turning up to a Boxing Day match at Goodison Park. It took 92 years to see that attendance record broken. The legacy of that ban, along with today’s male-centric set-up, means the top women’s teams are beholden to the goodwill of their male overlords.

They scurry down the street, then double back and settle upon an Audi.</p> <p>One of the group kneels down, unscrews the tire valve cap, stuffs a lentil inside and puts the cap back on.

It’s not you, it’s your car.”</p> <p>America has embraced large SUVs like no other country, even in liberal, walkable areas like the Upper East Side, so the activists face a steep task in attaching stigma to the supersized cars that now dominate US streets. But Tyre Extinguishers’ nascent US operation has been flooded with insults and even death threats. One message vowed to “deflate your lungs” while another critic, in a nod to the British roots of the campaign, wrote: “Damn you, Redcoats!”</p> <p>The death threats aren’t a big concern, an activist named Alex insisted. “People have emailed ‘if you fuck up my SUV I will kill you’, which I get a kick out of, to be honest,” she said. “You’re not going to find me.

It’s a vanity thing. You have freedom of choice, sure, but you don’t have freedom from consequences.”</p> <p>An army of SUV owners across the US would probably disagree. Sedan cars long reigned as the best-selling category across America but SUVs <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/suv-sales-best-sellers.html\">overtook them in 2015</a> and haven’t looked back. When you include pickup trucks (such as the chunky Ford F-150, which has been America’s best-selling vehicle since Ronald Reagan was president), large, truck-like vehicles now make up <a href=\"https://www.motor1.com/news/587230/suvs-still-rule-us-market/\">nearly three-quarters of all car sales in the US</a>.</p> <p>Modern SUVs offer comfort with a veneer of adventure and ruggedness, even for urban dwellers – a few Toyota Sequoias, named after the towering trees found in a mountain range 3,000 miles from New York that are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/23/1113158387/us-forest-service-emergency-action-sequoias-wildfire\">on fire</a> because of the climate emergency, dotted the Upper East Side streets. Americans have simply found the need or desire to drive huge cars. “We need a larger vehicle because I have two sons that are special needs,” <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/vacaville-womans-tires-slashed-in-apparent-movement-against-suvs/ar-AAZl7U9\">explained</a> Quanda Ellis-Walker, who had her tire deflated in California. “It was terrifying to know that someone would come and do this to you.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24495947e520b7a1b78d11ec5254a8963791f5bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24495947e520b7a1b78d11ec5254a8963791f5bd/0_0_5772_3848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hands holding lentils\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the Tyre Extinguishers holds a handful of lentils.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, because SUVs combine the weight of an adult rhinoceros and the aerodynamics of a refrigerator, they require more energy to move around than smaller cars and therefore emit more pollution. As their popularity has soared, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/01/suv-conquered-america-climate-change-emissions\">so has their impact upon the climate crisis</a>.</p> <p>Over the past decade, the emissions from SUVs eclipsed all shipping, aviation, heavy industry and even trucks, usually the only vehicles to outsize them on the road.<strong> </strong>The world’s SUVs belch out 700 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> a year, about the entire output of the UK and Netherlands combined.</p> <p>While many US cities lack decent public transport options, “it does not follow logically that we should flood our streets with dangerous, oversized, glacier-melting SUVs when smaller and more efficient vehicles that could easily satisfy most motorists’ needs exist,” according to Doug Gordon, co-host of the popular The War on Cars podcast and an avid New York cyclist. “If the Tyre Extinguishers spark a conversation about the absurdity of driving a 6,000lb Cadillac Escalade to pick up a 60lb kid from soccer practice, then good for them.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"afe86472f1a53d4171ce87514d8265caa621a479\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afe86472f1a53d4171ce87514d8265caa621a479/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of legs walking on crosswalk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Tyre Extinguishers on a mission on the Upper East Side.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the acts of minor sabotage mounted last Wednesday, the activists had to invoke some self-imposed rules. No SUVs with disabled stickers were targeted, nor anything that appeared to be used for certain work. A vehicle was chosen for a deflation only for the group to notice it had a “surgeon” sign in the window – the lentil was swiftly removed before the tire fully deflated.<strong> </strong>Conversely, an SUV that was deemed “so huge, so gross” had two of its tires collapsed.</p> <p>By the early hours of the morning, 55 SUVs had been “disarmed”, as the group calls it. No one intervened, not even a group of boisterous drunk young people who staggered past a deflation in progress. The group was wary, however, of security cameras, as the NYPD has circulated grainy footage of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/t_extinguishers/status/1541809104351821824?s=11&amp;t=78Un2TrafxaehySUpuVhLw\">previous deflation </a>operation in an attempt to identify the culprits.</p> <p>Tampering with random people’s property for being harmful to the environment is a departure from standard climate protests, which usually involve mass marches with signs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/25/fridays-for-future-school-climate-strikes-resume\">school “strikes”</a> or direct action taken against large entities, such as Exxon or a bank.

It’s an innovative, simple tactic to take the air out of someone’s tires, it’s not harmful, it’s just annoying. It’s like the training wheels to something confrontational.”</p> <p>Fisher said she had noticed climate campaigners were becoming more confrontational, as frustration mounts over the dawdling pace of action to tackle the climate crisis. In the US, a summer that has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/12/us-temperatures-hit-record-levels-south-west-heatwave\">record heatwaves</a>, the supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/30/us-supreme-court-ruling-restricts-federal-power-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">boxing in the federal government’s response to the crisis</a> and Congress yet again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/15/joe-manchin-condemned-us-climate-action\">failing to deliver</a> climate legislation will probably only fuel the impotent rage.</p> <p>“There are a lot of people who care about the environment who are very disappointed and are looking for a protest tactic,” said Fisher. “You have people flying in private jets and driving SUVs, so there are lots of opportunities for bad feelings between people with different views on that. It wouldn’t surprise me if these actions are the start of something more confrontational and more destructive. I can see it exploding at some point.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"24419a10f4e4ca4140bdf869c503ce8e6d22e4a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24419a10f4e4ca4140bdf869c503ce8e6d22e4a5/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A person, covered by a tree bark, rests a flyer on an SUV windshield\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tyre Extinguisher puts a document on a car.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jutharat Pinyodoonyachet/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a sweltering night, part of New York’s <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/heat-wave-to-set-records-from-dc-to-philadelphia-nyc-on-east-coast/1219738\">longest heatwave in a decade</a>.
