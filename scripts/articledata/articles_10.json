Now he revisits the Welsh island in a Brexit Britain where belonging has become a vexed issue","byline":"Catherine Love","body":"<p>In many ways, 2006 feels like a long time ago. Pre-credit crash, pre-Brexit, pre-pandemic – a different world. It’s understandable, then, that Shôn Dale-Jones was initially reluctant when he was invited to remount his 2006 show Floating. What can a piece of theatre from that past world say to the tumultuous present day?</p> <p>Still Floating grapples with that question. One strand of the show revisits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/aug/23/edinburghfestival2007.edinburghfestival2\">Floating</a>, in which Dale-Jones’s theatrical alter-ego Hugh Hughes tells a surreal narrative about the Isle of Anglesey drifting away from – and eventually back to – mainland Britain. This is spliced together with the present, in which Dale-Jones makes a visit to Anglesey – Ynys Môn – the birthplace that he left behind, and questions what it really means to make a home.</p> <p>In the wake of Brexit, there’s an obvious parallel between Anglesey’s fictional breakaway and the UK’s messy separation from the EU. This is reinforced by the present-day sections of the show, in which the German wife of Dale-Jones’s childhood friend has recently returned to her native Berlin. After the last few years, she no longer feels at home in Britain. Meanwhile, the holiday property boom in Anglesey is leaving locals homeless while half the houses sit empty. For different reasons, those born and bred on the island are also struggling to retain their sense of home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/yippee-ki-yay-review-die-hard-richard-marsh-gilded-balloon-edinburgh\">Yippee Ki Yay review – Die Hard, starring a knackered dad in a vest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There’s a lot going on here. Especially in the 2022 narrative, it can be a struggle to keep track of all the different elements and map out their connections. Pertinent issues – like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/12/abersoch-second-homes-holiday-wales\">impact of holiday home ownership on communities</a> – are introduced without ever being fully explored. And because so many ideas are packed in, there’s not room to properly reflect on the relationship between then and now in the revisiting of Dale-Jones’s earlier show. Towards the end, especially, it all feels a little rushed.</p> <p>Luckily, Dale-Jones is a winning performer who just about manages to hold on to the various strands, even if he can’t quite tie them together. Maybe the lesson of the show, like the lesson Dale-Jones learns when he returns to the island, is that it’s never straightforward to go back.</p> <p>• At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/still-floating\">Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 28 August</a>.<br>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2022+tone/reviews\">All our Edinburgh reviews</a></p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/14/without-warning-and-only-sometimes-scenes-from-an-unpredictable-childhood-by-kit-de-waal-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T18:00:15Z","webTitle":"Without Warning and Only Sometimes: Scenes from an Unpredictable Childhood by Kit de Waal – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/without-warning-and-only-sometimes-scenes-from-an-unpredictable-childhood-by-kit-de-waal-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/14/without-warning-and-only-sometimes-scenes-from-an-unpredictable-childhood-by-kit-de-waal-review","fields":{"headline":"Without Warning and Only Sometimes: Scenes from an Unpredictable Childhood by Kit de Waal – review","trailText":"The My Name Is Leon author’s evocative memoir of growing up in 1960s Moseley perfectly captures the dreams and reality of migration to postwar Birmingham","byline":"Lynsey Hanley","body":"<p>When Mandy O’Loughlin was little, she fell hard off a table at her home at 70 Springfield Road, Birmingham while singing along to (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction on the radio. After nearly biting her tongue in half, she lived off ice-cream and had a lisp for weeks. When she asked her baby sister to give her “a kith”, her siblings gave her a nickname that stuck: Kit.</p> <p>If you want to find out how and why the sweet, clever, permanently uncertain Mandy grew up to be Kit de Waal – the bestselling author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/22/i-wanted-to-write-about-a-care-system-that-didnt-care-very-much-kit-de-waal-on-my-name-is-leon\">My Name Is Leon</a></em>, among others, and tireless amplifier of working-class voices in literature – then you must read this book. She grew up in 1960s Moseley, that unusual bohemian enclave of Brum where poor kids and posh kids played together and De Waal’s parents, “a little woman from Wexford” and a bus driver from St Kitts, raised five children without ever really growing up themselves.</p> <p>Mom and Dad, Sheila and Arthur, aren’t so much bemused as utterly thrown by life as it is presented to them. Sheila had once frequented jazz clubs and lived a sort of working-class version of the high life in London, and here she is in Birmingham, condemned to buying meagre groceries on tick and beating rats out of the shed. Arthur, for his part, obsessed with old romantic movies on the telly, comes home from the bus depot laden with “beautiful, beautiful” new shoes and lengths of mohair for bespoke suits, all for himself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Becoming a Jehovah’s Witness family involves meetings inconveniently timed to clash with Top of the Pops</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the children are hungry, always. At her friend’s house, Mandy’s posh playmate Cressida turns down trays of food and pop brought by her mother as they’re “not hungry”. Shamed into voicelessness, Mandy has to pretend that her “Barbie is hungry” in order to get food that she can’t get at home. Cressida has never been forced to “roam the house in search of old bread and economy margarine”, as her parents can afford both food and clothes – which, curiously, makes them happier and less stressed than Mandy’s.</p> <p>One day, a knock at the door comes and it’s a woman bearing magazines full of pictures of happy people. Her mother lights up at the promise of paradise, where “no one looks at [her] like she’s no good for having black children”, and where “black people with enough to eat are living next door to white people with enough to eat”. There’s a small problem, though: for Jehovah’s Witnesses, paradise will come, but only after Armageddon, which will happen in 1975. “Or thereabouts.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c9bddc6d973594533dbe7dbb5f46f2ca65eab0d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9bddc6d973594533dbe7dbb5f46f2ca65eab0d5/0_580_3849_4808/801.jpg\" alt=\"Kit de Waal, 2022.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kit de Waal, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the O’Loughlin children, becoming a Jehovah’s Witness family involves interminable hours spent at weekly meetings, inconveniently timed to clash with <em>Top of the Pops</em>, at which Mandy and her siblings nearly die with boredom and fail to have their various forms of hunger sated. Like their parents, they long for escape, but unlike them seek flight to better places that actually exist, through music and books and the teeming life of Moseley outside their unhappy, falling-down home.</p> <p>When Arthur goes back to St Kitts for the first time in 20 years, alone, he orders a giant barrel that he fills with goodies for distant relatives, the likes of which his children have never seen: chocolates, nice soaps, toffees, toys, bedclothes. He returns four months early, even sadder than before. Sheila then flies to Florida to visit Auntie Mary, armed with a case of “Irish food, Ovaltine and Polo mints”.</p> <p>How could they do this? How could they semi-starve their children while hoarding treats and possessions for their own use? But it rings all too true. This memoir is an astonishingly good evocation of the dream and reality of migration to postwar Birmingham, a city that must have seemed flush with cash to anyone moving from elsewhere. It gave its migrant working class a promise of riches while delivering a life of hard work and exhaustion.</p> <p>They just wanted to get out, and who can blame them? De Waal got out, and doesn’t judge: she understands because she watched and listened so closely. “When the other one is out,” she writes of her parents, “they tell us stories about their life before us. They both want us as their audience, for the depository of their dreams, for their excuses, justifications, explanations.”</p> <p>To be used as a sounding board rather than a person does things to you. In De Waal’s case, it made her an outstanding observer of relationships and the way no two individuals’ experiences can ever map neatly on to each other’s. In other words, a true writer. The cliche that unhappy families are all unhappy in their own way was never truer in her case. The world didn’t end in 1975, after all, but by then Mandy O’Loughlin had found a way to survive.</p> <p><em>Lynsey Hanley is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/estates-9781783783823\">Estates: An Intimate History</a> (Granta) among other books</em></p> <p>• <em>Without Warning and Only Sometimes: Scenes from an Unpredictable Childhood</em> by Kit de Waal is published by Tinder Press (£16.99).

This uncanny coincidence ceased after a bit and so much the better – but in a way, it seems relevant this afternoon.</p> <p>Chelsea v Spurs is one of the great fixtures of English football, oozing animus and history. And because both sides are now pretty good, it comes freighted with greater tension, making a steaming Saturday afternoon in August entirely the wrong place for it. It needs howling wind, driving rain and soul-curdling cold, breath visible in the night air and grown adults performing the sort of ludicrous antics to which sun and summer are unconducive. </p> <p>But because we’re back to playing matches at random, where it belongs is where it is, and this should be an absolute belter. Just a few months ago, things looked sketchy for Chelsea, the provenance of Roman Abramovich’s money – and the glory it bought – finally catching up with them, their future as a force apparently imperilled. Except Todd Boehly and mates have, so far, made good on their promises, tossing cash about like confetti and strengthening a squad that was already pretty handy. Whether it’s good enough to contest the league title remains to be seen – this afternoon will tell us a bit about that – but it’s good enough to beat any team on any day, a decent spot in which to be. </p> <p>Spurs, meanwhile, have also been taken over - but by a manager, not a consortium. Antonio Conte read his situation and played his hand perfectly: a manager of his pedigree, having done the work he’d done, decides to leave because the board won’t back him? The job becomes toxic, players ask to leave and the club is worth less – not what Daniel Levy wants, and definitely not what Joe Lewis wants. So they were forced to invest and – almost against their better judgment – now have a team that looks ready to do something. It’s an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs, but here we are.</p> <p>Though both sides are settling and have managers disinclined to take risks, the chances of an expansive encounter are slim. But the intensity of both, coupled with the mutual antipathy in the stands, means that they should treat us to a compelling afternoon nevertheless - however wrong it feels. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 4.30pm BST</strong></p> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/14/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:49:53Z","webTitle":"Kane snatches draw for Spurs at Chelsea as clashing Conte and Tuchel see red","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/14/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Kane snatches draw for Spurs at Chelsea as clashing Conte and Tuchel see red","trailText":"Harry Kane’s injury-time goal snatched a 2-2 draw for Tottenham at Chelsea with Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte shown red cards after furious clashes","byline":"Nick Ames at Stamford Bridge","body":"<p>For connoisseurs of football managers’ handshakes, this was the reward for those hours of dedication. For everyone else it was the inevitable conclusion to an afternoon that had hit boiling point during a second half of twists, turns and raw vitriol.</p> \n<p>Spurs had just rescued an undeserved draw through Harry Kane’s deflected header and there was scant chance, given what had passed, that Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte would part ways with smiles and invitations for a post-match beer. But the sight of the pair clashing for a second time after the final whistle, eyes bulging and throats bawling, was astonishing by any measure and will keep the FA’s disciplinarians fully occupied in the early part of this week.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/14/engrossing-spectacle-ends-with-tuchels-and-contes-handshake-war\">Engrossing spectacle ends with Tuchel’s and Conte’s handshake war</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Both were shown the red card; both will point fingers and there was plenty of that after Tuchel kept hold of Conte’s hand and sparked a furious response from his counterpart. Tuchel felt Conte had shown disrespect by not looking him in the eye as they shook: in reality it seemed both parties were spoiling for a renewal of hostilities after tempers had initially flared up on a controversial first equaliser by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg.</p> \n<p>It made for a follow-up, six years on, to the infamous Battle of the Bridge and there was more to digest during the final half-hour than most matches produce in their entirety. Chelsea had merited their lead, given by Kalidou Koulibaly’s wonderfully executed volley in the 19th minute; they had been faster, stronger, cleverer and more creative than Spurs, while this was one of those days when several clones of N’Golo Kanté seem to have invaded the pitch. But there was a snowball’s chance in hell of Conte, on his old turf, taking that lying down, and his team finally awoke with ferocious consequences.</p> \n<p>Tuchel was less happy to credit Tottenham with that level of agency and he had a point. He felt neither of their goals should have stood and there was certainly widespread bemusement when, half a minute before Højbjerg scored, Anthony Taylor elected not to penalise Rodrigo Bentancur’s challenge on a marauding Kai Havertz.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e2dd453d4a34f520799c3ae28b6ee1e0a23239a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2dd453d4a34f520799c3ae28b6ee1e0a23239a/0_24_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Kane heads in Tottenham’s last-gasp equaliser\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Kane heads in Tottenham’s last-gasp equaliser.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It looked a clear foul; Chelsea still had ample opportunity to clear the resulting attack, which was finished by a low 20-yard shot that snicked off Koulibaly, but their manager was in little mood to see things that way given there was also cause to complain that an offside Richarlison had obscured Édouard Mendy’s line of sight.</p> \n<p>Instead he took exception to Conte’s characteristically vein-throbbing celebration, which appeared to have been aimed in his direction, barging into the Italian and setting in train a short-lived screaming match. Backroom staff and substitutes piled in, some keener to keep the peace than others, and both men had to be led away before a drinks break temporarily cooled things.</p> \n<p>Proceedings on the pitch crackled thrillingly from there. Havertz somehow failed to convert a Reece James cross but that did not appear to matter, from a Chelsea perspective, when they regained the lead with a goal that epitomised their showing. Dejan Kulusevski was pressed into conceding possession and, via Kanté and the impressive Raheem Sterling, the ball was spirited to an open James. A confident finish raised the roof and, again, the temperature: Tuchel set off on a sprint that ended near the corner flag, this time passing Conte without a glance. Had Chelsea held on, it may have been the image that marked the beginning of Todd Boehly’s new era.</p> \n<p>Boehly had been greeted before the game, more than a little cloyingly, by a giant banner bearing his likeness that was passed along the Matthew Harding stand. Opposite, the Shed End displayed a tapestry reading “Welcome to the house of fun, Todd and Co”. By the end that descriptor undersold what this venue had staged. Chelsea looked certain to celebrate the win when Mendy tipped Ben Davies’s header over from a corner in the fourth minute of added time and thought they might even finish a player to the good when VAR pored over the set piece, showing clearly enough that Cristian Romero had hauled Marc Cucurella down by the hair as it was sent in.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/aug/14/chelsea-v-tottenham-premier-league-live\">Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham: Premier League - as it happened!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>No punishment was forthcoming and, when Ivan Perisic delivered from the right, Kane flicked in a header with slight assistance from a combination of James and Koulibaly. He had missed a one-on-one at 1-0 and otherwise been smothered but it is always dangerous to presume an off day on his part. Tuchel’s argument was that Perisic’s corner should never have been taken; it was difficult not to sympathise.</p> \n<p>It was less easy to feel generous towards either manager by the time they had finished, but perhaps anyone expecting this occasion to pass quietly was simply naive. Neither man had let the weather conditions bother him, roaming the technical areas indefatigably from the start, with one Tuchel rant at Havertz confirming that he was suitably keyed up.</p> \n<p>When he reviews the football itself, Tuchel will feel his side did little to get angry about: the unattended Koulibaly’s cracking finish from a deep Cucurella corner came straight after a near miss from Havertz and Chelsea retained their grip for most of the game. On another day, although probably one overseen by different coaches, it would even have been worth poring over a highly effective outing at right wing-back from Ruben Loftus-Cheek. But this league increasingly demands box-office fare from its managers and here, tastefully or not, they obliged. Even if the handshake made heads shake, this was as compelling as it gets.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/14/fbi-trump-search-gop-outrageous-rhetoric","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:42:38Z","webTitle":"GOP governors rebuke party members’ ‘outrageous rhetoric’ over Trump search ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/fbi-trump-search-gop-outrageous-rhetoric","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/fbi-trump-search-gop-outrageous-rhetoric","fields":{"headline":"GOP governors rebuke party members’ ‘outrageous rhetoric’ over Trump search ","trailText":"Larry Hogan describes comparisons of the FBI to Nazi Germany’s secret police, made by Florida senator Rick Scott, as dangerous","byline":"Oliver Laughland","body":"<p>A handful of Republican governors have criticized the “outrageous rhetoric” of their party colleagues in the US Congress, who have accused federal law enforcement officers of a politicized attack on former president Donald Trump after executing a court-approved search warrant on his Florida home this week.</p> <p>The Maryland governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican moderate, described attacks by party members as both “absurd” and “dangerous”, after a week in which certain Republicans have <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-republicans-trump-estate-raid-gestapo-20220809-7mzwynlhv5cnxn2twpnesja4dm-story.html\">compared the FBI to the Gestapo</a> and fundraised off the slogan: “<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-mocks-ex-fbi-agent-after-selling-defund-fbi-t-shirts-1733439\">Defund the FBI</a>”.</p> <p>Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Hogan described the comparisons of the FBI to Nazi Germany’s secret police, made by the Florida senator Rick Scott, as “very concerning to me, it’s outrageous rhetoric”.</p> <p>He added: “It’s absurd and, you know, it’s dangerous,” especially after an armed man enraged by the raid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/fbi-attacker-trump-capitol-riot-truth-social\">was killed in Ohio</a> when he tried to invade an FBI office. “There are threats all over the place and losing faith in our federal law enforcement officers and our justice system is a really serious problem for the country.”</p> <p>On Monday, FBI agents executed a search warrant at the former president’s private members club and residence in south Florida with an unsealed warrant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/fbi-agents-trump-search-mar-a-lago-documents\">later revealing</a> Trump is under investigation for potential violation of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice over his alleged mishandling of classified documents.</p> <p>The episode inflamed conservative commentators and politicians still deeply loyal to the former president, and was followed by the attack on the FBI field office in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Thursday, which led to a six-hour armed standoff that left the lone gunman shot dead.</p> <p>Hogan, who is <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marylands-hogan-first-potential-gop-2024-presidential-hopefuls-visit-iowa-state-fair\">rumored to be considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024</a>, argued that many of his colleagues in Washington had been “jumping to conclusions without any information, which I think was wrong”.</p> <p>He added that revelations in the unsealed warrant were a “serious concern” but argued investigators should provide further details on the contents of the seized documents.</p> <p>Hogan’s comments were followed by remarks from Arkansas’s Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, who appeared on CNN on Sunday and partially mirrored his Maryland counterpart.</p> <p>“If the GOP is going to be the party of supporting law enforcement, law enforcement includes the FBI,” Hutchinson, a former US prosecutor and private practice attorney, said.</p> <p>He added: “We need to pull back on casting judgment on them … No doubt that higher ups in the FBI have made mistakes, they do it, I’ve defended cases as well, and I’ve seen wrong actions. But we cannot say that whenever they [FBI officers] went in and did that search that they were not doing their job as law enforcement officers.”</p> <p>The comments marked a growing split on the extremist rhetoric from certain Republican party members following the execution of the search warrant. Many senior Senate Republicans have remained largely quiet in the wake of the unprecedented law enforcement action, while <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/president-donald-trump-fbi-plant-evidence-florida-home-mag-lago-1732923\">others</a> have appeared on conservative news channels supporting baseless accusations that the FBI planted evidence during the search.</p> <p>The Republican congresswoman from Wyoming Liz Cheney, a ranking member on the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, has condemned her colleagues’ rhetoric as “sickening”.</p> <p>“I have been ashamed to hear members of my party attacking the integrity of the FBI agents involved with the recent Mar-a-Lago search,” Cheney <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepLizCheney/status/1557809792822824960?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">wrote on Thursday</a>. “These are sickening comments that put the lives of patriotic public servants at risk.”</p> <p>Her stance is slowly being mirrored by other House Republicans after the warrant was made public on Friday.</p> <p>Dan Crenshaw, a Republican congressman from Texas, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/08/13/cracks-emerge-in-gops-mar-a-lago-response\">told Axios</a> on Saturday that sloganeering against the FBI “makes you look unserious”. And the ranking homeland security committee member, John Katko, told the website: “This is not something you rush to judgment on ... It’s incumbent upon everybody to take a deep breath.”</p> <p>Meanwhile on Sunday, the White House continued to refrain from commenting on the search warrant. The press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, repeatedly declined to answer questions on the matter during an interview with ABC News, citing the US justice department’s independence on law enforcement matters.</p> <p>When shown video of comments made by the House Republican Elise Stefanik, a staunch Trump loyalist, who described the search as “complete abuse and overreach” by the FBI, Jean-Pierre broadly fired back.</p> <p>She said: “The Department of Justice, when it comes to law enforcement, is independent. This is what we believe, and this is what the president has said. This is not about politicizing anything. That is not true at all.”</p> <p>Jean-Pierre added a reminder that the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the US Senate in bipartisan vote, and that Trump nominated FBI director Christopher Wray to his position in 2017.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/14/man-drives-car-into-barricade-capitol-fatally-shoots-himself","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:42:22Z","webTitle":"Man fatally shoots himself after driving car into barricade near US Capitol","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/man-drives-car-into-barricade-capitol-fatally-shoots-himself","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/man-drives-car-into-barricade-capitol-fatally-shoots-himself","fields":{"headline":"Man fatally shoots himself after driving car into barricade near US Capitol","trailText":"Police did not determine motive for the man’s actions, but no indication he was targeting Congress members, who are in recess","byline":"Maya Yang","body":"<p>A man drove into a barricade near the US Capitol in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc\">Washington DC</a> on early Sunday morning, fired several shots into the air after his vehicle ignited, and then shot himself to death, according to police.</p> <p>Officials were quick to note they had not determined a motive for the man’s actions, though they did say there was no indication he was targeting any Congress members, who were in recess at the time.</p> <p>The man – identified as Richard Aaron York III, 29, of Dagsboro, Delaware – crashed his car into the barricades at East Capitol and Second streets, a <a href=\"https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/law-enforcement-investigating-car-crash-gunshots-and-suicide-east\">press statement</a> from the Capitol police announced.</p> <p>As he exited his car, the vehicle became engulfed in flames.

They were, Sayed says, a risk worth taking.</p> \n<p>Sayed had spent three years – between 2010 and 2013 – working alongside Australian troops, an interpreter on their frontlines, serving on combat missions in the dust of Uruzgan, before a decade serving the broader coalition mission, working at Kandahar’s sprawling military airfield.</p> \n<p>He carries the certificates of appreciation, signed by his commanders, lauding his “first-rate skills”, and describing him as “an example for your fellow countrymen”.</p> \n<p>A letter of recommendation, signed by Sayed’s Australian warrant officer, reads: “Should Sayed ever have reason to seek assistance from an Australian Embassy or Consulate I would ask that every kindness and courtesy be extended to him and ask that Embassy and consulate staff remain mindful of the dangers, hardships and sacrifices that Sayed has endured due to the nature of his relationship with Australian service personnel.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baaf0639e8923a546062c8912633032fedca71fe\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baaf0639e8923a546062c8912633032fedca71fe/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A military transport plane departs overhead as Afghans hoping to leave the country wait outside the Kabul airport in August 2021\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A military transport plane departs overhead as Afghans hoping to leave the country wait outside Kabul airport in August 2021.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcus Yam/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sayed remembers his time alongside Australians fondly. “It was good work, but it was very risky.

I spent a lot of time with the Australians, and we had good times together.”</p> \n<p>In 2013, Sayed was rejected for Australia’s locally engaged employee (LEE) visa – created specifically for Afghan nationals whose service on Australia’s behalf had exposed them to danger.

He was remembered, and a flurry of urgent phone calls, emails and letters flew between defence, home affairs and ministers’ offices. In rapid time, Sayed had secured himself a 449 visa to Australia.</p> \n<p>He ran the gauntlet of Airport Road in Kabul, again narrowly escaping the Taliban guards, and found the Australian military contingent marshalling evacuation flights.</p> \n<p>Australian officials were running two lists at Kabul airport – one compiled by home affairs, one by defence.

Belonging, for the moment, nowhere.</p> \n<h2>‘You just survive’</h2> \n<p>Sayed tells the Guardian he remains in contact with his former interpreting colleagues still trapped inside Afghanistan. For many, the Taliban-controlled border crossings into Pakistan and Iran are too great a risk.</p> \n<p>“My colleagues say ‘life is very hard, you just survive’.</p> \n<p>“‘You cannot go outside, you cannot visit friends, you cannot trust anyone any more, you just sit in [your] home and wait and hope they will not come for you’.”</p> \n<p>Videos of Taliban brutalities, of people being whipped, beaten, shot dead in the street, make clandestine rounds of phones in Afghanistans, hastily passed on before being deleted: anything could be compromising.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f27999120a600bdbe26fc940068670fd42d4358\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f27999120a600bdbe26fc940068670fd42d4358/0_0_5325_3550/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taliban security search the belongings of a pedestrian along a blocked street in June 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taliban security search the belongings of a pedestrian in June 2022.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wakil Kohsar/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hunger is everywhere across Afghanistan, Sayed says, and those who had least before suffer most now.</p> \n<p>Since the fall of Kabul – <em>suqut</em> in the Dari dialect of the capital – Taliban rule has grown steadily more oppressive.</p> \n<p>Schools for girls are shuttered, women have been beaten in public for failing to dress to the Taliban’s austere standards, officials of the former democratically elected government have been assassinated.

They cannot speak to any friends or relatives because they cannot trust anyone. They are in a far away place.”</p> \n<p>The number of Afghans trying to reach Australia overwhelms the number of places available. To the start of August, more than 47,900 applications for humanitarian visas have been lodged in Australia by or on behalf of Afghan nationals – representing more than 211,100 applicants.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A total of 31,500 places are available to Afghan nationals over the next four financial years, across Australia’s humanitarian program and family stream.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs told the Guardian: “The Australian government remains committed to supporting the Afghan community at this distressing time and asks for patience with visa application processes given the number of applications far exceeds the number of places available under the program.”</p> \n<p>The spokesperson said more than 5,500 Afghan nationals had arrived in Australia on temporary humanitarian visas since the fall of Kabul.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fa18c737332261894904550976211148473d6d6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fa18c737332261894904550976211148473d6d6/0_0_4947_2968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taliban stand guard along a road in Kabul in June 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taliban rule has grown steadily more oppressive over the past year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahmad Sahel Arman/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The government has extended the validity of 449 visas, and will continue to assist Afghan nationals holding those visas to travel to Australia “where they are in a location where we can assist”.</p> \n<p>“The Australian government aspires to progressively increase Australia’s humanitarian intake and will review and consult with the community on future humanitarian program numbers and settings.”</p> \n<p>Sayed says his temporary life in the Netherlands is comfortable, but mired in uncertainty.</p> \n<p>He is seeking, still, a way to Australia, and ultimately to reunite with his family in safety.</p> \n<p>“Every day I worry.

They have no talent for drawing, they say. But neither do I. And I’m really enjoying learning how to do it.</p> <p>When I was a kid, my grandma took me to visit Senaka Senanayake, a famous Sri Lankan artist. I gazed up at the walls of his house in central Colombo, plastered with his colourful drawings and paintings. Many of them were decades old, from when Senaka was a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFxye7Yand0\">child prodigy</a>.</p> <p>For years I thought all artists were like that – imbued with some gift the rest of us were denied. But I’ve come to realise that while I may never become Senaka, I can always get closer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1396af5d07ef10361f31d10ab16e7996c285820b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1396af5d07ef10361f31d10ab16e7996c285820b/0_42_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An early sketch of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An early sketch of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Nicholas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My early drawings were flat objects plonked on the page, with little internal relation or coherence.

It’s as much about process and approach. This means you can learn – you can teach yourself – to get better. My terrible drawings were, and are, plagued by a lack of understanding of the subject and a tendency to rush. There’s probably also a bunch of other issues that I don’t yet know to look for.</p> <p>Through practice, I’ve gotten better at forcing myself slow down (though still much less than I should), to closely observe and measure. To “construct” the drawing rather than just letting fly.</p> <p>When I took my sketchpad on holiday two years later, I had learned more about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)\">perspective</a>.

On the strength of their courageous comeback win in the opening round, Australian rugby fans had dared dream the men in gold might repeat the dose in San Juan before marching over South Africa (as they did in 2021), then vanquishing a sickly All Blacks.</p> <p>But the fumbling nature of their game in San Juan and the brutality of the scoreline has snuffed that hope and now, yet again, there is only tunnel at the end of that light. Defenders of the faith will find excuses in the departure of captain Michael Hooper before the first Test and the glut of injuries that has beset the side these past months, but the bare bones of this heavy defeat are the Wallabies were outplayed, out-enthused – and perhaps most worryingly of all – out-coached.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/14/wallabies-thrashed-by-argentina-in-record-rugby-championship-defeat\">Rugby Championship: Argentina score seven tries in record win over Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Dave Rennie continues to enjoy the strong support of Rugby Australia, the pressure on the coach is growing. With just two wins from his last eight Tests and an overall win-rate stubbornly sub-40% – the worst Australian record since the game turned professional in 1995 – the tremors of concern are now panicked shudders as the Wallabies wobble on their path to glory at the Rugby World Cup next September.</p> <p>Since the seemingly indestructible Hooper succumbed to his “mindset” struggles, speculation has bubbled up in the media that Rennie is training his players too hard and that the punishing regime is impacting the minds and bodies on match day. Whether the scattered thinking of young men subjected to excess mental and physical fatigue is why Australia consistently start Tests so sluggishly remains up for debate.</p> <p>Certainly, they stumbled out of the blocks worse than ever on Sunday, conceding a try in the first minute and finding themselves 14-0 down after six minutes of game time. The lapses were all-too familiar. After Australia spurned ball-in-hand mauling to kick the ball away, the Pumas countered, spinning it wide and left at pace to Juan Imhoff, who stabbed a grubber into a corridor of uncertainty between Australia’s back three.</p> <p>Winger Jordan Petaia cleaned up but then spat it to unsuspecting No 15 Tom Wright. Imhoff simply picked up the gift-wrapped fumble and scooted 22 metres to score. It was a rookie’s error but not one you’d expect from professional rugby players, and a queasy flashback to last month when Marcus Smith scooped up a similar Wallabies loose ball in the third Test in Sydney to seal the Ella-Mobbs Trophy for England.</p> <p>Argentina’s second try was even simpler, and as such, infuriating with Thomas Gallo picking and driving under the posts through a Wallabies defensive line soft as butter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f64d13a9906118fb3297fa81e484bf0d4fa65727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f64d13a9906118fb3297fa81e484bf0d4fa65727/0_0_2349_1566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wallabies flanker Fraser McReight is tackled by Argentina's Marcos Kremer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wallabies flanker Fraser McReight is tackled by Argentina's Marcos Kremer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Mabromata/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as they had in Mendoza, Australia found their new dawn at their darkest hour. Second Test tyro Fraser McReight, playing in Hooper’s No 7 jersey and channelling his absent leader’s tenacity, burrowed brilliantly at the breakdown to win a Puma ball. From the ensuing lineout, Rob Valetini charged over the gain line. It gave stand-in skipper James Slipper the momentum to slither over the stripe.</p> <p>Another Wallabies comeback victory looked likely in the 24th minute when Petaia took the ball at speed and flipped it over his shoulder for James O’Connor to score. But when that five-pointer was overturned after Slipper was pinged for a tip tackle and illegal cleanout, Australia’s resolve crumbled when it should have hardened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/14/wallabies-thrashed-by-argentina-in-record-rugby-championship-defeat\">Rugby Championship: Argentina score seven tries in record win over Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Argentina caught the mental drift and struck a decisive blow, with a wonderful solo try from inside centre Jeronimo De La Fuente who split the Australian defence wide open and turned a callow Wallabies error into a calamitous 14-point swing.</p> <p>When another Valetini break after half-time saw Petaia crash over only to be stripped of the ball by Gonzalo Bertranou, Australian heads dropped. Cheika’s men, ascendent in the critical moments and smarter by half, then brought down the sword over and over, with a seven-tries-to-two demolition – their biggest ever win over Australia.</p> <p>Although each team in this year’s Rugby Championship now sits level, with one win and one defeat apiece, Australia trail the field they headed this time last week. They now face a two-Test series against a Springboks side chastened by the resurgent All Blacks and eager to avenge their upset defeats by the Wallabies last season.</p> <p>While Slipper admitted he was happy to slink out of Argentina after a “really tough tour”, Rennie was ropable, describing the demolition as a “massive disappointment” and drawing a line in the sand. “We certainly want to earn the respect of the country,” he thundered post-game, “and you don’t do it with performances like that.”</p> <p>He’s right. But it’s an all-too familiar refrain from a coach and team with bigger issues. Their fullback, line-out jumpers, decision-making and discipline were again exposed, and tactically they were out-foxed by their old friend-turned foe Cheika, whose men kicked, rucked and gelled better, with greater discipline and superior resilience.</p> <p>Australia had their moments – they seized a few but, as usual, blew too many.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/15/laurinda-review-a-disappointingly-uneven-adaptation-of-a-beloved-book","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:30:17Z","webTitle":"Laurinda review – a disappointingly uneven adaptation of a beloved book","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/15/laurinda-review-a-disappointingly-uneven-adaptation-of-a-beloved-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/15/laurinda-review-a-disappointingly-uneven-adaptation-of-a-beloved-book","fields":{"headline":"Laurinda review – a disappointingly uneven adaptation of a beloved book","trailText":"Based on Alice Pung’s novel about an Asian student in an elite Australian school in the 1990s, this timely production feels scattershot and unconvincing","byline":"Cher Tan","body":"<p>School. For some it’s easy – a romp, a popularity contest to be won, a time of growth; for others, it is a minefield, impossible to know where and how to tread. The latter experience forms the basis of Laurinda, a new play co-written by comedian Diana Nguyen and Petra Kalive (who also directed), adapted from the award-winning 2014 young adult novel of the same name by acclaimed author Alice Pung.</p> <p>Lucy Lam (Ngoc Phan) is a bright young lady from the fictional suburb of Stanley, where her father works at a carpet factory and her mother does so-called “home duties” as an outworker while caring for her baby brother. When Lucy receives a scholarship to attend the prestigious Laurinda Ladies College, her world changes. She leaves her public school friends behind and attempts to start on a new path in life among girls of a different upbringing. As she finds herself having to navigate the unspoken social rules that permeate the lives of the upper class, Lucy finds a friend in Katie (Fiona Choi), who is looked down upon by “The Cabinet” – a trio of girls (played by Gemma Chua-Tran, Chi Nguyen and Jenny Zhou) who hold social power purely due to their family connections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/02/laurinda-takes-the-stage-private-school-culture-needs-to-change-the-insularity-the-entitlement\">Laurinda takes the stage: ‘Private school culture needs to change – the insularity, the entitlement’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The play isn’t a faithful retelling of Pung’s novel, but that’s not a problem. Here, Lucy is first introduced to us as a 38-year-old woman in the present, having realised her childhood ambition to become a schoolteacher. Through a bit of time travel trickery orchestrated by her friend Linh (Chua-Tran), who is introduced to the audience as a banana (both figuratively and literally), Lucy finds herself back at Laurinda. Memories are relived: she endures bullying from The Cabinet and subtle racism from steely headmistress Mrs Gray (Georgina Naidu) and her remedial English teacher Mrs Leslie (Choi, who pulls off multiple roles with flair). The chasm widens between Lucy’s life at school and home, as she navigates the expectations of her parents (Roy Phung and Chi Nguyen in notable performances as Ba and Má) alongside the cloistered world of Laurinda.<br><br>It’s clear we’re back in the 90s: less than a third into the play, we hear snippets of a Backstreet Boys song and Pauline Hanson’s infamous “we are swamped by Asians” speech. There are references to John Marsden and Daniel Johns. But there’s little in the way of set design: minor props (an ornate desk, a grand piano, a hospital bed, a toilet) are pushed in and out, but otherwise the set is remarkably sparse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"853a83aea41859e63929c2da99737f99c62a2137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/853a83aea41859e63929c2da99737f99c62a2137/0_236_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Phung, Ngoc Phan, Georgina Naidu, Fiona Choi, Jenny Zhou, Chi Nguyen, Gemma Chua-Tran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Roy Phung, Ngoc Phan, Georgina Naidu, Fiona Choi, Jenny Zhou, Chi Nguyen and Gemma Chua-Tran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Busby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A better-directed play might have been able to propel the show through imagination alone; in this uneven production, such sparseness only detracts from the experience. A large projected background fills in the gaps as we see Lucy at the school library, or when she reflects on her internal turmoil during an unconvincing soliloquy.</p> <p>As culture diversifies in the western world, creating opportunities for those long minoritised in the arts to tell their stories, Laurinda is remarkably timely. It arrives amid a surge in anti-Asian racism during the pandemic and renewed discussions about the place of private schools in Australia – hotbeds of nepotism and corruption among the elite. All of this makes Laurinda ripe for adaptation. And, hearing untranslated Vietnamese (which recalls the untranslated Cantonese in Benjamin Law’s Torch the Place) on a main stage is exciting.<br><br>And yet by deliberately casting Asian actors in originally Anglo roles, a certain flattening occurs. While this can be interpreted as a well-intentioned nod towards representation, it comes across as naff, especially in a heated scene in which slurs are hurled between The Cabinet and Lucy. In the novel, Lucy’s sense of being ostracised by her white peers is visceral; here, having Asian actors taunt each other almost feels like it is being played for comedy, even shying away from showing the realities of racism. What’s wrong with showing oppression for what it is? Racism hasn’t gone away. White audience members cackle. Lucy’s anger, as she retaliates, feels like something more suited for the screen.<br><br>The treatment is uneven. It’s unclear what the play wants to be, as musical, dramatic and comedic elements pivot in a scattershot manner, never lingering on one for too long. The book is well-paced and written with nuance: readers are left to figure out the gaps, making the story that much more enriching for those who recognise Lucy’s experience and illuminating for those who don’t. Halfway into the play, when Mrs Leslie chides Lucy for misunderstanding what is required of her, she is told that “you see the things you are and you see them wrong”. Unfortunately, this turns out to apply to Laurinda as well.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Melbourne Theatre Company’s production of <a href=\"https://www.mtc.com.au/plays-and-tickets/whats-on/season-2022/laurinda/\">Laurinda is on at Southbank theatre The Sumner until 10 September</a></em><br></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/14/the-guardian-view-on-bidens-green-deal-leadership-after-trumps-denialism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:30:16Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Biden’s green deal: leadership after Trump’s denialism | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/the-guardian-view-on-bidens-green-deal-leadership-after-trumps-denialism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/the-guardian-view-on-bidens-green-deal-leadership-after-trumps-denialism","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Biden’s green deal: leadership after Trump’s denialism","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> The first major climate law passed in the US comes not a moment too soon for a burning planet","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>When the House of Representatives passed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/us-house-passes-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act\" title=\"\">landmark climate legislation</a> on Friday, Joe Biden chalked up one of the surprise successes of his presidency.

Written by Newton-John after her initial breast cancer diagnosis in 1992, this song was released on her deeply personal album Gaia<em>. </em>Its uptempo mantra became a mainstay of her concert set lists and an anthem for other cancer survivors.</p> <h2>9. Physical</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWz9VN40nCA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vWz9VN40nCA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A song so sexy Tina Turner declined to record it, Physical blasted off any last vestiges of Newton-John’s wholesome image that remained from her bouncy 1974 Eurovision entry <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eOMLWh0YIE\">Long Live Love</a> and heralded a new era of reinvention. There’s little left to interpretation as she pouts, “There’s nothing left to talk about unless it’s horizontally”. The song’s famous music video was in fact a panicked last-minute suggestion by Newton-John to her manager, Roger Davies, as an antidote to soften the suggestive subtext. Newton-John later remarked in her 2018 autobiography Don’t Stop Believin’ that, “compared to what’s on the radio today, it sounds like a lullaby”.</p> <h2>8. I Need Love</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTS4fPq6sk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_GTS4fPq6sk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Listen, this is a bit of a deep cut for casual fans of Newton-John and I doubt this will make it on to any other top 10 lists circulating, but it’s such an underrated single and rightly deserves a revival or at least another listen. Released as one of four new songs on 1992 compilation album Back to Basics: The Essential Collection 1971–1992, it draws strong parallels to Madonna’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyhdvRWEWRw\">Erotica</a> period: sultry, come-hither vocals, pared-back instrumentation and sleek production from the “godfather of electronic music”, Giorgio Moroder. A comeback tour was planned; however, shortly after the release, Newton-John was diagnosed with cancer and all publicity was cancelled. I can’t help but wonder what could have been.</p> <h2>7. Making a Good Thing Better</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GYElqhjni4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2GYElqhjni4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A relic of the 1970s from the album of the same name, this ballad with its Moog-y intro and lush orchestral arrangements is a guilty pleasure of mine. It’s peak wholesome, a jolt of sunshine.</p> <h2>6. I Honestly Love You</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pFw6rprqH8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6pFw6rprqH8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The true genius of this song, written by Peter Allen and Jeff Barry, is that it feels so intimate, as though Newton-John is singing it just to you. It’s raw, it’s tender, it’s vulnerable and is delivered with a plaintive caress. An enduring classic by which she will be remembered.</p> <h2>5. Don’t Stop Believin’</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA52Hp6hKSI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sA52Hp6hKSI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Another chart topper from 1976 that went on to characterise Newton-John’s optimism and approach to life. Don’t Stop Believin’ has the same ethereal quality as I Honestly Love You, but there’s also a melancholy, reminiscent of Karen Carpenter, which makes this song even more enchanting.</p> <h2>4. Soul Kiss</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yydxdWaoOJg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yydxdWaoOJg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A unique delicacy in Newton-John’s back catalogue, Soul Kiss was the titular single from her 1985 album. What Physical conveyed with a wink and a nod, Soul Kiss took to the extreme with an almost carnal passion: “Soul kiss / Some nights you get me wondering / Is this the way / This is a hunger / Well, I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)”.</p> <p>The cold, industrial synths are a sublime contrast to her silky, warm vocals. The album art featured a famously provocative photoshoot by Helmut Newton, in yet another reinvention of Newton-John’s image. However, it was a tough sell commercially and, with Newton-John pregnant at the time, it ultimately fell victim to a lack of publicity. The whole album is still a firm favourite of mine.</p> <h2>3. A Little More Love</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzPru7yrEUQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZzPru7yrEUQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Pure pop perfection. It was always a delight to hear Newton-John perform this one live and still hit all those high, high notes. I’m thrilled this one is <a href=\"https://kworb.net/ww/\">topping the charts</a> again.</p> <h2>2. Have You Never Been Mellow</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2S1nmxYmUg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t2S1nmxYmUg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A No 1 hit in the US, Have You Never Been Mellow exquisitely showcases the clarity of Newton-John’s voice. John Farrar, who worked with the singer extensively throughout her career, puts his signature touch on the production with layered harmonies that reverberate through every fibre in your body. When this came on the radio in the supermarket the other day, I immediately dissolved into a puddle of tears.</p> <h2>1. Xanadu</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D0sCKYABUk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6D0sCKYABUk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably impatiently jumped to the end of the list to gauge what I believe defines Newton-John’s greatest song and are now scoffing at my critical judgment. However, pleasure comes in all flavours and mine is the neon confection that is Xanadu. I find this song is best consumed directly from the film, so you can also enjoy the frenzied rhythm of roller skate clacking, and Gene Kelly clapping and chanting, before Newton-John’s vocals descend like the heavenly muse she portrays in the film.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/aug/15/carlton-set-for-agonising-afl-season-denouement-after-latest-heartbreak","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:30:16Z","webTitle":"Carlton set for agonising AFL season denouement after latest heartbreak | Jonathan Horn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/15/carlton-set-for-agonising-afl-season-denouement-after-latest-heartbreak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/15/carlton-set-for-agonising-afl-season-denouement-after-latest-heartbreak","fields":{"headline":"Carlton set for agonising AFL season denouement after latest heartbreak","trailText":"The Blues were seconds away from securing a finals berth but there is little time to dwell on the club’s latest episode of anguish","byline":"Jonathan Horn","body":"<p>Football, the historian Manning Clark once said, is “an emotional bath of agony and ecstasy”. For Carlton, this week’s bath was run on Thursday night, with a two-hour soliloquy from a crack QC. It bubbled over 48 hours later, at the city end of the MCG, with the son of a stand-up comedian sinking them at the death.</p> <p>The Blues had it in the bag. They were a dozen seconds away from finals. “Did you see that?!” Luke Darcy kept squawking in the commentary box. We’ve been seeing it for a quarter of a century, the chalk white Carlton fans would have told him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/12/missing-the-mark-could-afls-new-deal-leave-fewer-games-on-free-to-air-tv\">Missing the mark: could AFL’s new deal leave fewer games on free-to-air TV?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With this game, as with so many classic matches played this year, it’s hard to know where to begin. But Thursday night’s tribunal appeal is as good a place as any to start. No-one on the Carlton payroll, with the possible exception of Patrick Cripps, has worked harder and hit more targets than Christopher Townshend QC. He claimed the initial tribunal decision was “infected with error.” He didn’t draw breath for nearly two hours. If only some of Cripps’s teammates had his chops.</p> <p>But it was bewildering for the rest of us. It’s bewildering to love a sport, and to really have no idea what its rules are. It’s bewildering to listen to three hours of miked up umpires bellowing like trumped up corporals, and barely hear a word from their bosses all year. It’s bewildering that the fortunes of a season, and the significant emotional investment of far too many of us, can rest on the skills of a Queen’s Counsel.</p> <p>Heading into Saturday night’s game, Carlton seemed to be spluttering to the line. They seemed to be out of petrol, out of luck and out of midfielders. George Hewett, Matt Kennedy and Adam Cerra were all unavailable. Jack Silvagni – exquisitely bred, one-paced and much maligned – was charged with second ruck responsibilities.</p> <p>But with Cripps, there was hope. Few individual players mean more to their team than the Carlton skipper. He has been carrying them for years. He carried them to the point where he broke his back. At times, he has looked like a footballer who’s been asked to do too much. On Saturday night, he licked his palms, rubbed them together and went to work. For much of the first half, his stats outnumbered the collective IQ of those booing him. He’s a heavy haulage player, the way Chris Judd was in his Carlton years. But his field kicking was sublime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2738133e0487e76a9537e87ae4491000861bf9ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2738133e0487e76a9537e87ae4491000861bf9ce/0_0_3953_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kysaiah Pickett of the Demons kicks a goal to win the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kysaiah Pickett of the Demons kicks a goal to win the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a while, Melbourne’s plan, like the QC on Thursday night, seemed to consist of boring the opposition into defeat. But the game caught fire in the second half. It seems unfair to regulate Melbourne in this analysis, and to make it all about Carlton. Jake Melksham, whose football career could have been scripted by Clark, played the game of his life. Angus Brayshaw had nearly 40 touches, and there were few cheap ones among them. “We shat the bed last week,” Christian Petracca said afterwards. This week, they controlled their bowels, kept their heads and secured the double chance.</p> <p>But the story of the night was Carlton, and what could and should have been. “Nothing helps,” Clark said, “except the siren.” On Saturday, that siren seemed an eternity away. When Curnow finally kicked straight and put them eight points up, that should have been it – that should have been finals. When they were chipping around on the members wing, that should have been it – that should have been finals. But in the final excruciating minutes, there was a sense of impending doom.</p> <p>Michael Voss said it was a matter of “detail”. It was detail that Matthew Owies’ kick got to Adam Saad on the first bounce. It was detail that they kicked down the line to a team that gobbles those sort of kicks better than any other. It was detail that Jesse Motlop, in his 11th game and weighing all of 11 stone, was caught one-on-one with May in the final 30 seconds. As Melksham shovelled the ball to Kysaiah Pickett, there was an inevitability to the whole thing.</p> <p>“One of the many virtues of the Carlton players over the years,” Clark said in 1981, “is that they give their supporters years in which they can convalesce and strengthen themselves for another bout of the strange malady.” But modern-day Carlton players and fans don’t have that luxury. They have to dust themselves off, ignore the free kick differential, and look ahead to one of the most highly anticipated home-and-away matches in years against Collingwood.</p> <p>They also have to turn their eyes to Tasmania, and to the early game next Sunday. No-one knows what’s going on with the Western Bulldogs this year. Their game on Saturday was a ghastly affair. If they lose to the Hawks, Carlton are in. But we won’t know for sure until about 4pm. In the meantime, 90,000 people are expected to trek to the MCG. It’s a date with a bitter rival whose bubble finally burst yesterday. As season denouements go, it doesn’t get much more appetising, or more agonising.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/15/recovery-will-be-different-for-every-patient-fighting-addiction-but-it-is-always-worth-pursuing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:30:16Z","webTitle":"‘Recovery’ will be different for every patient fighting addiction, but it is always worth pursuing | Xavier Mulenga","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/recovery-will-be-different-for-every-patient-fighting-addiction-but-it-is-always-worth-pursuing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/recovery-will-be-different-for-every-patient-fighting-addiction-but-it-is-always-worth-pursuing","fields":{"headline":"‘Recovery’ will be different for every patient fighting addiction, but it is always worth pursuing","trailText":"The idealised result for people with mental illnesses is to rapidly return to their ‘normal’ level of functioning.

The idealised version for people with mental illness is to rapidly return to their “normal” level of functioning shortly after entering treatment with their general practitioner, psychologist or psychiatrist. Unfortunately, recovery is not always clear-cut and people often aren’t sure what they will lose along the way.</p> <p>Peter is a client that often comes to mind.</p> <p>He is a 39-year-old man who works as an accountant in a small business. He has been married to Amara for 10 years and they have two children, nine-year-old Maya and seven-year-old James. Peter had been referred to my clinic by his GP for assistance with his alcohol and cocaine use, and low mood. This had caused significant marital problems and a recent police charge of driving under the influence and the loss of his licence for three months.</p> <p>Despite heavy drinking for the past seven years, Peter presented for treatment because he was told by his employer to get on top of his alcohol problem or he would lose his job. Like many men I see in the clinic, Peter had been referred several times before, but only with the risk of losing his employment did he keep his appointment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/11/when-doctors-reconsider-their-life-calling-the-pressure-is-telling-them-to-leave-to-survive\">When doctors reconsider their life calling, the pressure is telling them to leave to survive | Saretta Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Peter starts by saying, “I don’t think I’m that bad. It’s just work and the wife that seem concerned by my drinking.” I assume that Peter is minimising his problems to appear better than he really is. I don’t challenge him directly, but opt to continue the session. I’ve been taught that rapport building is one of the more important parts of the first session. You can’t treat people if they don’t return.</p> <p>During the assessment, Peter tells me that he is drinking two bottles of wine a night and blames this on financial stressors, arguments with his wife and difficulty connecting with his children. His alcohol intake only became a problem after the birth of his son. At the time, Amara was a stay-at-home mother and he was working overtime to make ends meet. The drinking was the starting point of several arguments with his wife, leading Peter to go out more with his friends, which escalated into weekly cocaine binges.</p> <p>Peter is now sleeping in the living room and is vague on the reasons for this. I ask him if Amara is considering a separation and he denies this, saying: “I don’t think so. We’ve been married too long.” I make a mental note to consider a family meeting at a later stage of treatment. He concedes that the distance between his children and himself does make him sad and he is constantly apologising for being hungover or forgetting sporting activities.</p> <p>At the end of the assessment, I recommend a hospital detox as a circuit breaker and a chance to initiate anti-craving treatment for his alcohol dependence. Peter is initially hesitant, but later agrees when I advise him that his employer would look favourably on this course of action, and it allows his wife and children to get to know him sober. He is admitted the next week and his withdrawals are managed with some diazepam and thiamine. Peter agrees to take naltrexone (anti-craving medication) to assist with remaining sober. To my relief, Peter is aiming to be completely abstinent from alcohol in the coming months as he sees controlled drinking as too risky for him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/healing-can-begin-with-a-handshake-inside-sydneys-only-aboriginal-run-drug-and-alcohol-counselling-centre\">‘Healing can begin with a handshake’: inside Sydney’s only Aboriginal-run drug and alcohol counselling centre</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This detox raises some concern when neither his wife, children or friends visit him during the hospital admission. This is sadly not uncommon, but for a man who is undergoing his first detox there tends to be more fanfare. Peter makes excuses for them which are later put into question when his wife sends me an email stating she has a restraining order against him. She also alludes to domestic violence. Ultimately, Amara says that Peter cannot return to the family home and will instead live with his parents. When this information is presented to Peter, he tells me he was already aware but was hoping this detox would get him back into Amara’s good graces.</p> <p>In the last week of his detox, I observe that Peter has some signs of depression and I recommend antidepressants which he refuses, saying: “I think that’s too many pills.” We discuss therapy to assist with staying sober and interpersonal issues involving his wife and children. Peter worries that therapy will make his symptoms worse as it involves rehashing old wounds. He agrees to weekly group therapy as the compromise and further outpatient appointments when he is discharged into the care of his parents.</p> <p>Detox is the first step in a difficult journey towards recovery. The next months are difficult for Peter. While engaged in weekly group therapy, he relapses during the court process of both the restraining order and the divorce. On his third detox admission, Peter decides to trial mirtazapine to assist with his poor sleep, fleeting suicidal thoughts and low mood. Fortunately, he has been able to improve the relationship with his children and they visit him in hospital, chaperoned by his parents. He agrees to begin individual therapy on discharge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/26/a-massive-spiritual-shift-how-the-mindful-movement-of-qigong-can-treat-addiction\">‘A massive spiritual shift’: how the mindful movement of qigong can treat addiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The following months are more positive. Peter can remain sober for longer periods of time and this helps at work and at home. He gains a promotion from work and moves into a small apartment with a spare room for his children to visit. Eventually, the restraining order is dropped and he is able to have a healthier relationship with his ex-wife. Two years have passed and Amara has found a new partner which causes Peter some discomfort, especially when his children comment on how well he treats them. Peter has been less successful romantically and finds dating apps constantly frustrating.</p> <p>I recently reviewed Peter who has been sober for a year and his depressive symptoms are stable on medication. We talk about the challenges he has overcome in his journey to recovery. Peter tells me how lonely he is and explains that a good number of his friends were that of his ex-wife’s and he has been struggling to build his own support groups. He has his parents, children and a good job but hasn’t nurtured friendships over the years. We make some plans to work towards this in future sessions.</p> <p>When Peter leaves my clinic, I can’t help but think that he is one of the loneliest people I know.</p> <p>Recovery is rarely linear or tidy. The rule of thumb is the sooner you enter some form of treatment, the better the outcomes. With Peter’s case, we’ve seen substance abuse, detox, depression, divorce and relapse.

They <a href=\"https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-quarterly-update-december-2021\">fell a bit</a> during the lockdown years but are expected to jump back to pre-pandemic heights this year.</p> <p>Official projections last year showed <a href=\"https://www.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/October%202021/document/australias_emissions_projections_2021_0.pdf\">little change was expected</a> in Australia’s transport emissions before 2030. Again, this isn’t surprising. There is no national policy to reduce them.</p> <p>The lack of policy is not due to a lack of policy ideas. Among the most popular is the introduction of mandatory vehicle fuel efficiency standards. They would set an emissions target for manufacturers, measured in grams of CO<sub>2</sub> released per kilometre and averaged across all the new cars they sell. The target would be gradually reduced to zero, when it would effectively become a ban on new fossil fuel cars.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Albanese government has a freedom on EV policy that it has not granted itself in other climate-related areas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Australia has resisted, fuel efficiency standards are common elsewhere – they cover about 80% of the global light vehicle market.</p> <p>Why? There are arguments relating to climate impact, energy security and supporting manufacturing industries. Car companies themselves want fuel efficiency standards, arguing there won’t be an adequate supply of EVs into the country until a decent policy is in place.</p> <p>And the evidence says efficiency standards make economic sense – they reduce fuel costs.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/P1269-Fuel-Efficiency-Standards-WEB.pdf\">recent report by the Australia Institute’s Audrey Quicke</a>, if Australia had introduced fuel efficiency standards six years ago, the country’s drivers would have saved $5.9bn.

It would then develop a broader national strategy if it won power.</p> <p>That brings us to this week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/20/quick-jumpstart-nsw-to-spend-38m-to-speed-up-ev-uptake\">‘Quick jumpstart’: NSW to spend $38m to speed up EV uptake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An invitation-only national EV summit will be held in Canberra on Friday bringing together car company executives, infrastructure bosses and senior MPs from across the country to discuss the best path ahead.</p> <p>Its main subject will be how to design fuel efficiency standards.

Led by Eytan Lenko, the former chair of the thinktank Beyond Zero Emissions, Boundless aims to accelerate climate solutions needed for Australia to become a renewable energy superpower by 2030, with an initial focus on EVs.</p> <p>No one should underestimate the scale of transformation needed to get the country’s vehicle fleet to zero emissions in just 28 years. Given the average life of a car on Australian roads is about 10 years, the sale of new fossil fuel cars would have to end by about 2035. Any policy that doesn’t set the country on that path is not a policy for net zero.</p> <p>But the Albanese government has a freedom on EV policy that it<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/labors-climate-bill-is-mostly-symbolic-the-big-questions-are-about-what-comes-next\"> has not granted itself in other climate-related areas</a>.

A final policy is still some way off, but he is expected to use his keynote address to the summit to start to flesh out just what the road ahead will look like.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/15/australias-indefinite-detention-of-people-with-mental-impairment-breaches-human-rights-advocates-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:30:15Z","webTitle":"Australia’s indefinite detention of people with mental impairment breaches human rights, advocates say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/australias-indefinite-detention-of-people-with-mental-impairment-breaches-human-rights-advocates-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/australias-indefinite-detention-of-people-with-mental-impairment-breaches-human-rights-advocates-say","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s indefinite detention of people with mental impairment breaches human rights, advocates say","trailText":"Experts argue system lacks proper monitoring and effectively ‘disappears’ people, sometimes for decades","byline":"Christopher Knaus and Nino Bucci","body":"<p>Australia’s use of indefinite detention for people with cognitive impairments is a breach of human rights and the “outrageous” failure to implement a proper monitoring regime is rendering people with a disability invisible from public view, experts say.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/12/more-than-1200-people-are-detained-indefinitely-in-australia-with-no-criminal-conviction\">More than 1,200 people with a mental impairment are being indefinitely detained in Australia</a> despite not having been convicted of a criminal offence.

Aslef train drivers went on strike on Saturday. This week, the RMT union will resume its strike action over job security, pay and conditions, as the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, seeks to impose cuts of £2bn a year on a sector struggling to return to pre-Covid passenger numbers. It is a bleak picture and, given the vital role of public transport in reducing carbon emissions, a depressing one. But a glance at the rest of Europe suggests it really doesn’t have to be this way.</p> <p>In Germany, this has been the summer of the train. In June, the SPD-led coalition government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/germany-faces-calls-extend-9-month-public-transport-ticket\" title=\"\">introduced</a> a heavily subsidised and wildly popular €9 monthly public transport pass, designed to get people out of cars and, at the same time, ease the cost of living crisis.

One in five passengers appear to have taken the opportunity to use public transport regularly for the first time.</p> <p>Similarly bold experiments are taking place elsewhere, driven by the long-term goal of reducing carbon emissions and the short-term need to mitigate the impact of soaring fuel costs. In Spain, another socialist-led coalition administration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/15/spain-announces-free-rail-journeys-from-september-until-the-end-of-the-year\" title=\"\">introducing</a> free rail travel for commuters from September until the end of the year, and halving many other fares.

There have at times been uncomfortable levels of overcrowding, and it is uncertain to what extent holiday season travel patterns are relevant to the rest of the year. Initial audits also suggest that car usage may have remained constant. But in a nation famous for its love affair with the car, political imagination has opened up the possibilities of rail travel to more people and pointed the way to a cultural shift in tune with net zero targets. Mr Lindner’s green colleagues in government have <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-9-ticket-is-it-here-to-stay/a-62669414\" title=\"\">called</a> for a successor scheme to be partly financed by ending tax breaks on company cars. As a spokesperson for Deutsche Bahn, the national rail company, said: “Holding on to these riders long-term is important for transport and climate policy.”</p> <p>It would be nice to think that Mr Shapps – whose approach to the RMT strikes has been to pit the public against rail workers and replay the confrontational politics of the 1970s – has noticed that other countries are doing things differently. Sadly, it seems that managed decline is the peak of this government’s ambition for the railways. A trip to Berlin or Madrid might help the transport secretary see this strategic myopia and short-termism for what it is.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/14/wakefield-wigan-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:16:14Z","webTitle":"Jacob Miller improves Wakefield’s survival hopes in win against Wigan ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/14/wakefield-wigan-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/14/wakefield-wigan-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jacob Miller improves Wakefield’s survival hopes in win against Wigan ","trailText":"Wakefield Trinity’s head coach, Willi Poching, said: ‘We’re not done yet,’ despite opening up a good gap at the bottom by beating Wigan 30-12","byline":"Aaron Bower at Belle Vue","body":"<p>There is still plenty of rugby to be played before the Super League playoffs start but here, in the stifling summer heat, it was hard not to feel like two of the competition’s burning issues went some way to being decided.</p> <p>Wakefield Trinity have flirted with relegation all season but here, in the shadows of the construction work that will transform their crumbling but beloved Belle Vue home, they took a sizeable step towards securing their top-flight status.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/13/wakefields-belle-vue-upgrade-could-transform-club-but-only-if-they-beat-relegation\">Wakefield’s Belle Vue upgrade could transform club – but only if they beat relegation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toulouse’s defeat at Warrington on Thursday night left the door ajar for Wakefield to open up a four-point gap at the bottom with four games remaining. They did that in surprisingly stress-free fashion and, given the fact Toulouse’s run-in involves games against three of the top four, the cards are now firmly stacked against the French side extending their time in Super League into a second season. Wakefield, to their credit, deserved this victory and the likely rewards that will come with it.</p> <p>This was also a decisive day at the summit, too. With St Helens trouncing Hull further down the M62, it means Wigan trail the reigning champions by six points with four games to play. The Warriors will now have to settle for second place at best, though they could still be caught by either Huddersfield or Catalans, and given finishing in the top two means having the opening week of the playoffs free, Wigan’s season could still have plenty left riding on them.</p> <p>They were well beaten here and could have few complaints. Trinity handled the intense heat the better, with a largely error-free first half reducing the amount of time they had to defend in energy-sapping conditions. They crafted a deserved 18-6 lead by the break and, from there, never really looked back. “Every win is important but this one counts for a lot,” their coach Willie Poching said. “We’re not done yet, there’s four games to come and we’ll have to deliver that again I feel.”</p> <p>Wigan’s afternoon was summed up by the profligacy of their two most dependable attacking stars, Jai Field and Bevan French. While Field crossed for a try in the final minutes, by then the result had been decided. A 12-point lead at half-time was always going to be telling given the conditions and the Warriors were unable to claw their way back into contention against a Wakefield side who defended commendably throughout.</p> <p>“It’s a missed opportunity to put some distance between ourselves and the teams below us,” their coach, Matt Peet, said. “Wakefield started the game better than us and managed it really well. We never put it together for long enough. They were very good.”</p> <p>Wakefield took the lead when quick hands to the right freed Lee Kershaw, who finished well in the corner. That lead was then extended when the outstanding Jacob Miller sent Jai Whitbread across for their second try.</p> <p>Errors in this heat were always likely to be magnified, and when Sam Halsall’s knock-on afforded Wakefield another chance to attack, they took full advantage when Miller stepped past two Wigan defenders superbly. Halsall did redeem himself when he finished a French break, but a penalty from Lino extended the lead at the interval.</p> <p>The first try after half-time always felt pivotal and when Wakefield scored it through Kelepi Tanginoa, the balance of power swung firmly in the hosts’ favour. Wigan huffed and puffed with little success thereafter and while Field’s consolation narrowed the deficit, it was fitting Wakefield rounded off the scoring when Lewis Murphy intercepted a Field pass to race the length of the pitch and decisively move Trinity a step closer to Super League survival.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/14/its-time-we-woke-up-to-liz-trusss-crass-delusions","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T17:14:16Z","webTitle":"It’s time we woke up to Liz Truss’s crass delusions | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/its-time-we-woke-up-to-liz-trusss-crass-delusions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/14/its-time-we-woke-up-to-liz-trusss-crass-delusions","fields":{"headline":"It’s time we woke up to Liz Truss’s crass delusions","trailText":"<strong>Letters: </strong>The Tory leadership candidate should focus on real-life existential threats rather than undermining civil servants, say <strong>Rupert Huxter</strong> and <strong>Amanda Power,</strong> while<strong> Vivienne Jackson </strong>condemns her interpretation of ‘Jewish’ values","byline":"Letters","body":"<p>I was proud to work for some years, and to the best of my ability, as a civil servant in the offices of both Conservative and Labour ministers – it was my duty to the electorate and to the government of the day.

We face an energy crisis. We’ve failed to level up, or conjure up any Brexit dividend. The west and China are heading rapidly in opposite directions. Ukrainians are still being killed every day. Meanwhile, back on the hustings, Truss is frightfully busy showing us all that the post-Johnson Conservative government risks being really surprisingly (and dangerously) silly and disingenuous, divisive not unifying, and wholly lacking the guts and ability to face up to and tackle the issues that should really matter to us as a nation, and to the world we all inhabit.</p> <p>Making a positive difference has to start with critical honesty about where we’re at. After eight years in the cabinet already, Truss is simply never going to manage that.

We live in frightening and challenging times. As environmental instability accelerates, economic and social turbulence mounts. Scientists began warning of where we were headed in the 1970s when there was plenty of time to act. We got to where we are today because of the lullabies of corporate and political denialism, and a mass sleepwalking into climate breakdown. There are many forces that would like the population not only to remain asleep, but to join them in jeering at the very possibility of being awake to reality. The allegation of “wokery” is increasingly deployed against taking any action to mitigate or adapt to the consequences of rising temperatures. Its dangerous, disabling, calculated cultural purposes could hardly be more obvious. It is past time to put it to bed: wake the sleepers, and start having the serious political conversations and serious political leaders that the times require. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Amanda Power</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Kidlington, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>• It was unsettling to read about the congruence Liz Truss finds between “Conservative” and purported “Jewish” values.

We are a diverse, socially broad, heterogenous UK minority. Your notion of alignment is neither accurate nor safe for Jewish people.</p> <p>Please don’t implicitly set up Jewish people as a “model minority”.

It was more “blood and thunder and eye-gouging”, she responded.</p> <p>Davidson’s assessment of the nature of the contest is more widely shared in the party than Hands’, and as it heads towards its close there is concern that the blue-on-blue attacks will cause lasting damage to the Tories’ reputation.</p> <p>There is certainly an unusual level of animosity between the Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak camps. The two candidates have reportedly only spoken twice during the campaign, exchanging brief pleasantries. And instead of just attacking each other bitterly in background briefings, the two camps have been issuing on-the-record statements implying that their opponent’s policies are so flawed that, in effect, they are not fit to govern.</p> <p>This culminated last week in Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and Sunak supporter, writing an article saying Truss’s policies would be “electoral suicide” because they would not protect people from rising prices.</p> <p>For Labour, all the mud-slinging has been a godsend, and the party is now spending a “substantial chunk” of its digital budget on online advertising exploiting what the Tories have said.</p> <p>A party source said: “We have now got a fantastic bank of digital clips and quotes that we will be using in our campaigns in the months ahead, and what we say can now be predicated with the words: ‘Don’t take our word for it, just listen to what they say about themselves.’”</p> <p>David Davis, who was the runner-up in the Tory leadership contest in 2005, said he would like to see the winner try to heal the rift by appointing their opponents to cabinet.</p> <p>“One of the great guide books for every new prime minister should be Team of Rivals, about Abraham Lincoln’s cabinet, which consisted of all his rivals, and was one of the great cabinets in American history,” said Davis. “We need to do that both to secure the best talent, but also to bring the party together.”</p> <p>Davis took a job in the shadow cabinet after David Cameron became Tory leader in 2005. But this time round a “Team of Rivals” approach seems less likely, particularly if Truss wins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/13/poll-of-tory-members-gives-liz-truss-22-point-lead-to-be-next-prime-minister\">as the polls suggest she will</a>.</p> <p>Some of Truss’s allies are briefing that Raab is now certain to be sacked if she wins, with one claiming that he had been acting like “a suicide bomber”. Others in the camp, while reluctant to put it quite like that, ask how it would be possible for Raab to continue to serve under a prime minister whose economic philosophy he had rubbished so comprehensively.</p> <p>Interestingly, the Truss team believe the same calculations will make it very hard for Sunak to serve in her administration. Sunak has accused Truss of “fairytale” economics. “If you do have that view, it is hard to see why you would want to serve in the team,” said a Truss source.</p> <p>Voters famously do not like divided parties, but some Tories are sceptical about whether Labour’s edited highlights from the Tory hustings will be such a vote-winner after all.</p> <p>“There are no swing voters on social media,” said one Tory MP. “Labour will be advertising to people who either believe in them or hate them.”</p> <p>There is no evidence from polling yet that the conduct of the contest has further worsened the reputation of the Conservatives. On 7 July, when Boris Johnson resigned, according to the Politico “poll of polls” Labour had an average lead over the Tories of 10 points.</p> <p>That has shrunk to a Labour lead of five points. The contest may have been unedifying, but the resignation of Johnson has removed the main factor repelling some voters.</p> <p>While the insult-trading gathers attention, one party figure said that in six months’ time no one would remember what Raab said about Truss, and that the real problem was the “dutch auction in policy” which had led to implausible promises being made. That would turn out to be the most damaging legacy of the contest, he predicted.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2022/aug/14/anne-roose-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T16:33:11Z","webTitle":"Anne Roose obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/aug/14/anne-roose-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2022/aug/14/anne-roose-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Anne Roose obituary","trailText":"<strong>Other lives:</strong> Fashion designer who helped reinvent Welsh wool with her elegant contemporary designs inspired by Celtic tradition","byline":"Emma Hopkins","body":"<p>My mother, Anne Roose, who has died aged 90, was a fashion designer who helped reinvent Welsh wool with her elegant contemporary designs inspired by Celtic tradition.</p> <p>She was instrumental in saving the rare-breed Jacob sheep, working with Araminta, Lady Aldington and the Holywell Textile Mill in north Wales to transform the distinctive but rough fleece into beautiful cloth in natural tones, which culminated in her celebrated Anna Roose Jacob Collection (she used Anna as her professional first name).</p> <p>Anne was born in Blackheath, south London, to Muriel (nee Richards) and Ralph Paton, who worked for the Mazawattee Tea Company.

Each evening she would return to her room to sketch the designs from memory to post back to London.</p> <p>In 1954, Anne married Richard Roose, who worked in human resources. She soon combined running an increasingly successful business with bringing up three children in a sprawling Arts and Crafts house in Oxted, Surrey. The door was never locked, with family and friends of children – and, later, grandchildren – always welcome at Sunday lunches around a large Welsh farmhouse dining table.

His mother, Jane (known as Jinnie, nee Davies), worked pressing quarry tiles and his father, William Price, firing them. Music infused the family, with part-singing in chapel, ceilidhs at Hogmanay and lessons on an upright piano. In 1940, during the second world war, a bomb narrowly missed their terrace house, where they were sheltering under the table.</p> <p>When his father was injured and lost his job in 1941, Ivan left Wolstanton grammar school at the age of 14 to work at Wedgwood, where he developed a love for ceramics. He then entered national service as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/25/bevin-boys-art-wartime-britain-mining-museum-exhibition-\">Bevin Boy</a>, where shifts down the pit were followed by three hours practising the piano (he gained an ATCL – Associate of Trinity College London). He met Mavis Elizabeth Perkins (later known as Beth) at this time at a local youth group for drama, music and literature. They married in 1947.</p> <p>Ivan then undertook teacher training at Dudley College (1948-50), teaching music, and later also art, at Halmer End secondary modern (now Sir Thomas Boughey Academy). In the early 1970s he gained an Open University humanities degree and in 1981 he was awarded an MA by Keele University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f0a02bb2fdc882c397a60e0bd5ac1b9558b0f16f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0a02bb2fdc882c397a60e0bd5ac1b9558b0f16f/0_10_384_230/384.jpg\" alt=\"Ivan Price was a prolific painter, sculptor and potter\" width=\"384\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivan Price was a prolific painter, sculptor and potter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A prolific painter, sculptor in wood and stone, potter, and furniture designer and maker, Ivan also played the piano, lute and folk guitar, and formed an Elizabethan madrigal group. As well as teaching, he wrote and produced a children’s opera, and ran the Audley and Halmer End Evening Institute, an early example of lifelong learning.</p> <p>In 1963, Ivan and Beth bought an end-of-terrace house in the mining village of Bignall End, near Audley, in Staffordshire. For the next six decades it became the focus of Ivan’s creative projects as he remodelled the house according to 60s ideals of light and space, filling it with murals, furniture, ceramics, art and sculpture, and planting a garden oasis of trees and shrubs. A creative community evolved, with regular evenings devoted to political and philosophical discussion, live music and readings, with members such as <a href=\"https://makerpress.co.uk/\">Alan May</a>, who made boats, harpsichords and lutes, and a modern reconstruction of the Gutenberg press.</p> <p>A true localist, Ivan led campaigns to protect the green belt and to plant trees, was a member of Staffordshire Artists, and exhibited in Stoke and Keele.</p> <p>Beth died in 2012 after suffering from Parkinson’s disease, and his daughter Jan died in 2020 of motor neurone disease.

Many people wanted more detail about the reasons for cancelling a show titled Jerry Sadowitz: Not for Anyone.</p> <p>On Sunday the Pleasance said: “Due to numerous complaints, we became immediately aware of content that was considered, among other things, extreme in its racism, sexism, homophobia and misogyny. We will not associate with content which attacks people’s dignity, and the language used on stage was, in our view, completely unacceptable.</p> <p>“A large number of people walked out of Jerry Sadowitz’s show as they felt uncomfortable and unsafe to remain in the venue.

There is a line that we will not cross at the Pleasance, and it was our view that this line was crossed on this occasion,” it said.</p> <p>“We don’t vet the full content of acts in advance and while Jerry Sadowitz is a controversial comedian, we could not have known the specifics of his performance. The Pleasance has staged his work numerous times over the years, but as soon as we received complaints from those in the building which caused us great concern, we knew we could not allow the final performance to go ahead.</p> <p>“The arts and comedy in particular have always pushed the boundaries of social norms but this boundary is always moving.

Very worrying development. Would love to hear the reasoning behind this decision. Or why seemingly no one has explained it to Jerry.”</p> <p>Sadowitz has long been known for routines that most people would find grossly offensive. He has billed himself as “magician, comedian, psychopath.” The Guardian’s Brian Logan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/28/comedy-and-magic-penn-and-teller-jerry-sadowitz\">described him</a> as “the great, twisted granddaddy of abusive comedy.”</p> <p>In Canada, after he opened his show with the greeting “Hello moose-fuckers,” someone got on stage and knocked him unconscious.

Migrant rights experts say the situation puts workers at risk of what is essentially forced labour. </p> <p>The Home Office and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) are looking into the allegations, and the supermarkets have launched an urgent investigation into the issues raised by the Guardian.</p> <p>Hundreds of Indonesian farm workers have been recruited to work in Britain this summer on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/14/farmers-warn-of-threat-to-uk-food-security-due-to-seasonal-worker-visa-cap\">seasonal worker visas</a>, the immigration route created to tackle a shortage of farm workers after Brexit.</p> <p>Scores of pickers were sent to Clock House farm near Maidstone in Kent, which supplies berries to most major supermarkets and has appeared in an M&amp;S advert.</p> <p>Clock House said it was “deeply concerned” by the allegations and would “not have entered into an agreement with, or taken workers from, any entity that was involved in such activity [the charging of fees]”. It said it was working with the authorities to investigate the claims.</p> <p>The Indonesian workers were supplied by AG Recruitment, one of four UK agencies licensed to recruit using seasonal worker visas. AG denied any wrongdoing and said it knew nothing about Indonesian brokers charging money.</p> <p>AG was originally planning to recruit from Ukraine and Russia but changed its plans when war broke out in February, weeks before the picking season was due to start. Last year almost 20,000 Ukrainians came to Britain on seasonal worker visas, making up two-thirds of all those arriving through the scheme.</p> <p>AG had no previous experience in Indonesia and sought help from Jakarta-based Al Zubara Manpower, who in turn went to brokers on other islands who charged exorbitant fees to the people they introduced, according to one Al Zubara agent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"effd3064e8901dacc33f9cfe558178cd9070e312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/effd3064e8901dacc33f9cfe558178cd9070e312/0_87_3336_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plum picking\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Each season, Clock House farm uses an average of 1,200 workers to pick raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and plums.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Invoices seen by the Guardian show workers at Clock House with debts of between £4,400 and £5,000 to a broker in Bali who supplied workers to Al Zubara Manpower.</p> <p>While flights and visa fees are included in these debts, other charges included compulsory language training not required by farms, and hundreds of pounds for accommodation in Jakarta while awaiting visas. The debts have to be repaid by bank transfer in monthly instalments of up to £800, according to documents seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>Sukiasa Ketut, a freelance agent managing Al Zubara’s recruitment in Bali, said they used “many, many” freelance brokers who did not stick to the rules. He acknowledged that brokers pocketed money from charges and said he felt “really sorry” about the situation.</p> <p>He added: “We didn’t prepare well regarding the rules of how to recruit people, so we [went] to the recruiters and they just did this in their own way. We were surprised as some charged more and others charged less.”</p> <p>Even those workers who did not go through a third party were billed £2,500 by Al Zubara, with charges including a £560 training fee and a £362 visa fee, despite the Home Office listed fee being £259. Aside from £1,478 for the flight and the visa, there are not supposed to be unnecessary supplementary fees under the seasonal worker scheme.</p> <p>The managing director of AG Recruitment, Douglas Amesz, said he was unaware of brokers charging money, and there is no suggestion that he knew of the fees. He said he personally recruited candidates in Jakarta and that applications and visas were only processed by AG.</p> <p>Workers from Bali met Amesz in Jakarta and remember him telling them they should not pay any fees for jobs and that it was illegal. But they said local brokers told them not to disclose what they paid.</p> <p>Clock House farm uses 1,200 workers on average every season to pick raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and plums.</p> <p>It issued some<strong> </strong>Indonesian arrivals with a zero-hours contract, seen by the Guardian, despite this having been against the rules for those on seasonal worker visas since April 2022. After the Guardian approached it for comment in late July, the contracts were changed to guarantee a minimum of 20 hours.</p> <p>Payslips seen by the Guardian show labourers sometimes worked far fewer hours and can make less than £300 a week, leaving them concerned about their ability to repay debts. Clock House said it conducted an audit of its payroll and found workers picked for an average of more than 48 hours a week, meaning an income of more than £2,000 a month.</p> <p>Clock House pays workers £10.10 an hour, in line with the visa rules, and docks £10 a day from their pay to fund the caravans they live in on the site. </p> <p>Lawyers representing Clock House said the farm was “deeply concerned” about the recruitment issues flagged by the Guardian “and the potential welfare and worry that it would place on seasonal workers” and has reported the allegations to the GLAA.</p> <p>It said it was previously unaware of any problems, or of the existence of other recruiters aside from AG Recruitment. It has requested that AG supply no more workers from Indonesia until further investigation is carried out.</p> <p>On working hours, Clock House said it was writing to all seasonal workers to confirm that at least 35 hours work a week would be guaranteed on average over a 28-day period.</p> <p>Amesz said he was “extremely concerned to learn of the allegations that have been raised” and AG was “fully cooperating” with the GLAA.<strong> </strong>He said Al Zubara did not handle any recruitment and AG did not ask it to subcontract recruitment to other local organisations or brokers.</p> <p>He added: “We continually monitor all aspects of our supply chain and if we find egregious behaviour anywhere, we are committed to change.

The BRC continues to advocate for a single enforcement body to ensure that exploitation is prevented and worker’s rights are a top priority.”</p> <p>Waitrose said it was concerned and would take the “necessary steps to make sure workers are treated fairly”. Sainsbury’s said workers’ safe and fair treatment was “extremely important” and it was working with government and industry “to introduce measures to prevent these practices from happening”. Tesco said it did not tolerate the use of illegal recruitment fees charged to workers and it was vital for any to be repaid in full.</p> <p>The Home Office would not comment on specific allegations, but pointed out that the GLAA had no remit to investigate labour abuse and exploitation in other countries, saying it was incumbent on foreign governments to investigate.</p> <p>Andy Hall, an independent migrant rights specialist who investigates issues of forced labour in supply chains in Asia, said: “It seems the GLAA, Home Office, [Foreign Office] and also UK government officials working in overseas UK embassies have no remit or authority to actually monitor or investigate potential or real recruitment abuses in the source countries of workers migrating to the UK for work.</p> <p>“As migration of workers into the UK continues to take on increased importance, this is a significant black hole in terms of monitoring and regulation that needs to be urgently addressed if the government is to fulfil its global pledge to prevent forced labour.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/14/why-uk-farms-recruiting-fruit-pickers-from-7000-miles-away\">Why UK farms are recruiting fruit pickers from 7,000 miles away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hall said the challenges with the current agricultural recruitment model began with workers being made to bear the cost of flights and visas, which he said created significant debt before any other charges. “Workers often don’t understand what they’re getting themselves into.

With the focus now on Asia, it’s unclear who should police issues such as illegal broker fees","byline":"Emily Dugan","body":"<p>As a Guardian investigation reports that Indonesian workers picking fruit for leading UK supermarkets have ended up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/14/uk-farm-workers-kent-debt-indonesian-brokers\">debts of up to £5,000</a> for a single season, we look at what is driving a crisis in British agricultural labour and how exploitation can be avoided.</p> <h2>Why are farms recruiting fruit pickers from 7,000 miles away?</h2> <p>A shortage of farm workers created by Brexit led to 8,000 tonnes of berries going unpicked last year. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine only made the shortage more critical – Ukrainians made up two-thirds of all workers arriving on seasonal worker visas in 2021, with almost 20,000 working on British farms. When war broke out weeks before the picking season was due to start, recruiters had to look beyond Ukraine, with a rise reported in farm workers arriving from Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.</p> <h2>How much do farms rely on seasonal workers from overseas?</h2> <p>A great deal. In 2019 about 2,500 workers came to Britain on a pilot of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/14/farmers-warn-of-threat-to-uk-food-security-due-to-seasonal-worker-visa-cap\">seasonal worker visa</a>. This year the number is expected to be 40,000, with many coming from distant countries and little funding or infrastructure to investigate the circumstances of their recruitment.</p> <h2>Why are pickers on UK farms arriving thousands of pounds in debt to brokers in Bali?</h2> <p>AG Recruitment, one of only four licensed agencies allowed to recruit under the UK seasonal worker scheme, was tasked with filling a shortfall in farm workers quickly this year, including in Indonesia.</p> <p>With no previous experience in Indonesia, AG sought help from the Jakarta-based Al Zubara Manpower, which appears to have gone to brokers on other islands who charged exorbitant fees to the workers they introduced.</p> <p>The managing director of AG, Douglas Amesz, said he personally recruited candidates in Jakarta for Clock House farm in Kent, that applications and visas were only processed by AG, and he was unaware of brokers levying charges. He said he was “extremely concerned to learn of the allegations that have been raised”.</p> <h2>Do labourers have enough work to pay their debts?</h2> <p>Some pickers at Clock House were worried when they started work that they could end up trapped in debt, as multiple labourers were initially on zero-hours contracts, despite this being against the rules for those on seasonal worker visas since April 2022.</p> <p>With at least one worker making less than £300 a week once accommodation costs were charged, some were anxious about work running out as the picking season finishes before the end of their six-month visa.</p> <p>Clock House changed the contracts to guarantee a minimum of 20 hours after the Guardian approached it for a response. The farm said it conducted an audit of its payroll and found workers picked for an average of over 48 hours a week, meaning an income of more than £2,000 a month.</p> <h2>What about workers who were not charged illegal fees?</h2> <p>It is commonplace and within the rules for pickers to bear the costs of their flights and visas, despite experts saying that best practice is an “employer pays” approach. This means many workers arrive with significant debts when they are flying from the other side of the world, even without extra charges.</p> <h2>Will workers charged fees get their money back?</h2> <p>Unlikely. Dora-Olivia Vicol, the chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.workrightscentre.org/\">Work Rights Centre</a>, said: “The real tragedy is that compensating these workers will be extremely difficult. This is because enforcement agencies in the UK are not yet equipped to pursue and prosecute rogue recruiters registered abroad.</p> <p>“To go after them we would need sustained collaboration between enforcement agencies in the UK, and those in the countries that supply British farms with agricultural labour.

Suffice to say, the refuge they imagine – somewhere far from temptation and worldly chatter – soon becomes a very different kind of place as their faith in God and one another is tested to extremes.</p> <p>It all begins with a dream. In the monastery of Cluain Mhic Nóis, a celebrated visitor – a “living saint”, no less – awakens in the night convinced that he’s experienced a vision. Its meaning is clear: he must establish a new monastery on an island untainted by human existence, taking with him the two monks who featured in his dream.</p> <p>Brother Artt, as he’s named, is revealed to be insufferably sanctimonious, but his mismatched travelling companions are complicated, appealing creations. Gangly, red-haired Trian is a young piper whose family gave him to the monastery when he was 13. He’s a <em>ciotóg</em> – a left-hander – and profoundly awkward with it, but he carries about him a deeper mystery that will be disclosed only as the novel nears its wave-lashed denouement. Cormac, meanwhile, is a late convert to Christianity and old enough to have lived an entire other life before entering holy orders. He has the scars to prove it, some more visible than others: part of his skull has been lost to a battle injury, and the plague claimed his wife and all three of their young children.</p> <p>Despite close shaves with catapult-firing slavers and nights ragged with the howling of wolves, this is a character-driven narrative. Inevitably, tensions surface between the far from equal trio once their “sacred wandering” ends and they reach Skellig Michael. Artt’s insistence that “God will provide” sounds ever more delusional. Cormac, on the other hand, is all about practical matters, sowing seeds in the scant inch of soil the island offers and using stories to ease tensions. As for Trian, along with copying out psalters, he has the task of keeping the brethren in fish and fowl, and he finds himself more and more appalled by how easy it is to plunder the island’s innocent wildlife, flightless auks included.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Though this is a text replete with religious fable, it’s in descriptions of the physical world that the prose soars</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In her last novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/02/the-pull-of-the-stars-by-emma-donoghue-review-beauty-amid-horror\">The Pull of the Stars</a></em>, Donoghue – who was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2010 for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/01/room-emma-donoghue-review-fritzl\">Room</a></em> – presciently considered the impact of the 1918 flu pandemic, and this latest was a lockdown project, albeit planned pre-Covid. That perhaps accounts for the vivid sense that time is melting and days are merging. </p> <p>With bitter winter looming: “Trian writes and catches birds, slaughters them and writes. The days are getting shorter but feel endless to him.” Not even darkness offers an escape: “At night he dreams of throttling books in a great featherstorm of flapping pages.” What writer couldn’t relate?</p> <p>Though this is a text replete with religious fable, it’s in descriptions of the physical world that Donoghue’s prose soars and the narrative’s claustrophobia is alleviated. Likewise, among themes that include isolation and devotion, its ecological warnings are its most resonant. Artt, the novel’s least fully realised character, embodies a calamitous worldview that transcends religion and, largely, culture. Everything on the island, he preaches, has been put there for human use, “like one great banquet table that God’s spread for us”. Before long, they’re using pufflings as fuel, clubbing baby seals, felling the island’s lone tree.</p> <p>Donoghue’s critique of this is reinforced by Trian’s increasingly murderous misgivings and also in her acknowledgments. Skellig Michael, she notes, is now at risk from tourism and extreme weather unleashed by the climate crisis.</p> <p>While <em>Haven</em> certainly isn’t her most accessible novel, a flinty kind of hope brightens its satisfying ending. What the reader is likely to take away, however, is the image of a bleak place made still bleaker by human intervention.

I cannot sleep sometimes. I have a family who need my support to eat. And meanwhile, I think about the debt.”</p> <p>Clock House, which featured in a Marks &amp; Spencer advert last autumn and operates under the slogan “Growing a better tomorrow”, employs about 1,200 people a season to pick raspberries, strawberries, plums, blackberries and apples.</p> <p>Brexit had already made finding pickers tough, a situation exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Last year the majority of Clock House’s workers came from Ukraine, and the farm had been expecting about 880 to return.</p> <p>After war broke out and men were told not to leave Ukraine, Clock House went to a licensed British agency to find workers from Indonesia and Vietnam.</p> <p>The farm’s recruitment manager, Jane Packham, told BBC Radio 4’s Farming Today that when it tried to source British workers, 7,000 people got in touch, but only 100 actually started the work and “about one” stuck it out.</p> <p>Packham said this was “probably unsurprising”. “It’s a different sort of job, we’re not used to it – I couldn’t do it … You’ve got to have the eye for it, you’ve got to have the speed for it and you’ve got to be relentless.”</p> <p>In his first month, Banyu struggled to pick fast enough. He was on a zero-hours contract, according to documents seen by the Guardian, which appeared to be contrary to the rules of his seasonal worker visa, and he did not work the hours he hoped. This was later changed to a 20-hour minimum weekly contract, on hourly pay of £10.10, after the Guardian approached the farm for comment.</p> <p>Banyu and his colleagues’ arrival at the farm came about via a complex chain of brokers and agencies.</p> <p>When Banyu lost a good job in Bali at the start of the pandemic, he was left digging tunnels for 12 hours a day on a wage of less than £45 a week. So once he heard about an organisation offering enrolment on an English language programme in exchange for a job abroad, he jumped at the chance.</p> <p>The lessons were basic, but he was told the £550 course was essential to be matched with a job, even if candidates were already fluent. “The purpose of the training is we should pay,” Banyu said. “This class is really only for business, it’s not for teaching.”</p> <p>If you couldn’t pay for the course, you could borrow the money, which many did.</p> <p>From there, the debts to the broker grew. At first they were told their jobs might be in Australia, Canada or New Zealand. Banyu and his friends say when they learned their jobs would be in Britain, they were flown to Jakarta to meet the licensed UK agent who would sign them up and get their visa.</p> <p>The Bali broker put them up for three nights in a basic guest house. One worker said they were billed about £1,000 for their time in Jakarta.</p> <p>All six of the men in Banyu’s caravan say they still owed money to the broker and they know others on this farm and across the UK with similar debts. Once interest is added, documents seen by the Guardian show debts of between £4,400 and £5,000.</p> <p>While these debts include the cost of visas and flights – allowed under the seasonal worker visa – there are also thousands of pounds in fees for other services.</p> <p>In the three months Banyu was unemployed and enrolled on compulsory language lessons as part of his wait to come to Britain, he also got into further debt. He borrowed £1,600 from cousins to support his family and buy himself food, meaning his total debt from seeking work in Britain exceeds £6,100.</p> <p>While in Jakarta the workers met Douglas Amesz, the managing director of AG Recruitment, the licensed British agency commissioned to enlist them for the farm.</p> <p>AG teamed up with a Jakata recruitment agency, Al Zubara Manpower, to find hundreds of workers for British farms, including Clock House. It appears<strong> </strong>Al Zubara used brokers on islands across the country to find willing farm workers as quickly as possible.</p> <p>AG denies any wrongdoing<strong> </strong>and appears to have known nothing about the broker who had found the workers<strong>. </strong>Meeting in Jakarta, Amesz told Banyu and his friends not to pay any extra fees, and that this would be illegal, they said, but local brokers told them to not to disclose what they had paid.</p> <p>“I think Mr Douglas doesn’t really know about how Al Zubara made a connection to other agencies like our agency,” Banyu said.</p> <p>Amesz said AG was “fully cooperating” with the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority and that he was “extremely concerned to learn of the allegations that have been raised”. He said Al Zubara did not handle any recruitment and that AG did not ask them to subcontract recruitment to other local organisations or brokers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/14/why-uk-farms-recruiting-fruit-pickers-from-7000-miles-away\">Why UK farms are recruiting fruit pickers from 7,000 miles away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>AG said the Indonesian ministry of labour had conducted an investigation and confirmed that Al Zubara acted legally.</p> <p>Now, in August, Banyu is picking faster and working longer hours.

Rawalpindi, the bustling city in Punjab where they lived as a Hindu family, was one of the cities that ended up in the newly established Islamic republic of Pakistan after August 1947. The state of Punjab became the centre of terrible violence and Rawalpindi, which had a majority Muslim population, was engulfed by brutal communal killings as Hindus and Sikhs were driven from their homes and fled over the border to India.</p> <p>Growing up, Varma recalled a peaceful existence between her Hindu family and their Muslim and Sikh neighbours, who would often come over to their house for cups of tea and festival celebrations.</p> <p>But by March 1947, Varna remembered fear gripping the Hindu people living in the area. Neighbours would patrol their lane and alarms were put up in case Muslim attackers arrived at night. Eventually, in May 1947, Varma’s parents decided to send their children to the town of Shimla, a spot in the Himalayan foothills where they would go on holiday. Just 15 years old at the time, Varma packed only a few items, presuming she would return in a few weeks. Her parents followed them shortly after. They had no idea they would never see their home again.</p> <p>After 1947, it became clear it was inconceivable to return to Rawalpindi. “My parents had left everything behind and were suffering very badly,” she said. “For years, my parents kept thinking that we would go back.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9292221d0dc7f242ea2c12009af2f0b4b88e4836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9292221d0dc7f242ea2c12009af2f0b4b88e4836/0_89_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reena on balcony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reena waves from her childhood balcony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stuck without a home, with all their possessions and money left behind, Varma’s family eventually moved to Pune, in Maharastra. As the years passed, she began to pine for her house and thought often about finding a way to go back. But without any connections left in Rawalpindi, and with no way of knowing if her house was even still standing, she got on with her life. She got married and had two children, though “always felt like something was missing”.</p> <p>But Varma’s life was to change after joining a Facebook group called the India-Pakistan Heritage Club. She wrote a speculative post about her old house in Rawalpindi, describing in detail its location and nearby landmarks, asking if anyone could help track it down. Another member in Rawalpindi took up the task and sent her a message: he had found her old house, which, miraculously, was still standing.</p> <p>It took two rejected applications before Varma’s case reached the ears of Pakistan’s foreign minister and she was granted a visa. In July, she crossed the border for the first time in 75 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/india-partition_borders/giv-6562pEjusyaVLaaG/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/india-partition_borders/giv-6562pEjusyaVLaaG/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Varma was not prepared for the fanfare that greeted her arrival. Drums and singing accompanied her as she walked down her old lane and dozens of residents flocked to greet her, pulling her into a tight embrace. “I have no words to express how it felt,” she said. “Everything was done very happily and there was such a warm welcome when I got there. And I could not believe that the house was in such perfect condition.”</p> <p>She added: “People talk about India and Pakistan as divided, but when you go there, you get so much respect, such kind hospitality. Their hospitality is such that you’ll never forget.”</p> <p>The family now living in the house put her up for the night. There was, however, a sadness as she walked through the rooms and stood on the balcony. “I was missing my family so much.

By this point in 2021 there had been just over 11,300 crossings, out of a total of 28,526 detected crossings by the end of the year.</p> <p>According to the Ministry of Defence, there have been 3,618 crossings detected in August so far, with 1,694 in the past week. The highest daily total for 2022 to date was recorded on 1 August, when 696 people made the crossing in 14 boats.</p> <p>The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/06/channel-smugglers-drop-prices-and-cram-more-people-on-to-boats\">recently reported</a> that people-smugglers had dropped their prices and were cramming more people than ever before into already overloaded, flimsy boats.</p> <p>Last November, French police quoted a price of about £5,000 charged by smugglers for an individual to cross the Channel, according to <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-criminal-gangs-making-5000-25543548\">reports</a> in the Mirror. Now asylum seekers and nongovernmental organisations are saying prices have dropped to between £500 and £1,000 for a place in a boat.</p> <p>Campaigners say the increased numbers arriving in more overcrowded boats with cheaper crossing prices demonstrate that plans to forcibly remove some asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats are not acting as a deterrent.</p> <p>It has been four months since the home secretary, Priti Patel, unveiled plans to send refugees to Rwanda to try to deter people from crossing the Channel.

Further court hearings are due in September and October.</p> <p>Despite the growing numbers, the UK’s small boat arrivals are a fraction of the number of people going to Europe.

We need action to crack down on the criminal gangs who are organising and profiting from this, but instead Conservative ministers are making it harder to tackle the gangs and are wasting time and millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on a Rwanda plan that doesn’t work.</p> <p>“Labour’s plan will take that wasted money and put it into a new cell at the National Crime Agency to crack down on the criminals responsible and prevent more lives being put at risk.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-is-off-ventilator-and-able-to-talk-agent-says","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T15:40:17Z","webTitle":"Salman Rushdie ‘road to recovery has begun’ but ‘will be long,’ agent says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-is-off-ventilator-and-able-to-talk-agent-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-is-off-ventilator-and-able-to-talk-agent-says","fields":{"headline":"Salman Rushdie ‘road to recovery has begun’ but ‘will be long,’ agent says","trailText":"Author is off ventilator and able to talk after suffering stab wounds to his neck, stomach, eye, chest and thigh in New York attack","byline":"Ramon Antonio Vargas and agencies","body":"<p>Salman Rushdie’s “road to recovery has begun” but “will be long” after his stabbing in western New York late last week, the novelist’s agent has said.</p> <p>“The injuries are severe,” the agent, Andrew Wylie, said on Sunday in an email to the Guardian, alluding to stab wounds that the author suffered to his neck, stomach, eye, chest and thigh two days earlier. “But his condition is headed in the right direction.”</p> <p>The Indian-born British novelist remained hospitalised on Sunday in critical condition, but he had been removed from a ventilator, which allowed him to talk and demonstrate that “his usual feisty and defiant sense of humour remains intact,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZafRushdie/status/1558824251884445698\">his son Zafar said in a separate statement</a>.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Zafar Rushdie added that his father’s wounds were “life-changing”.</p> <p>Earlier on Saturday, Hadi Matar, the man suspected in Friday’s attack at a literary festival in upstate New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/13/hadi-matar-charged-with-attempted-of-salman-rushdie\">pleaded not guilty</a> to charges of attempted murder and assault at a brief court appearance where he was denied bail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/salman-rushdie-had-started-to-believe-his-life-was-normal-again\">Salman Rushdie had started to believe his ‘life was normal again’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joe Biden, the US president, praised Rushdie for “his refusal to be intimidated or silenced” and said the author stood for the essential ideals of truth, courage and resilience. “These are the building blocks of any free and open society.

Biden also said he was “shocked and saddened to learn of the vicious attack”.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Sunday that Iranian state institutions had incited violence against Rushdie for generations, and state-affiliated media had gloated about the attempt on his life.<br><br>“This is despicable,” Blinken said in a statement. “The United States and partners will not waver in our determination to stand up to these threats, using every appropriate tool at our disposal.”</p> <p>The European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, “strongly” condemned the attack on Saturday night. “International rejection of such criminal actions, which violate fundamental rights and freedoms, is the only path towards a better and more peaceful world”, Borrell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosepBorrellF/status/1558529740402790402\">tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Rushdie lived in hiding and under police protection for years after late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini put out a fatwa in 1989 calling for his death in retribution for Rushdie’s book The Satanic Verses. Many Muslims interpreted the author’s book as blasphemous because it included a character they found insulting to the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>Rushdie, 75, was at the Chautauqua Institution to speak about the importance of America’s giving asylum to exiled writers when he was attacked, and said recently that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/salman-rushdie-had-started-to-believe-his-life-was-normal-again\">believed his life was “very normal again”</a>.</p> <p>On Saturday, district attorney Jason Schmidt alleged that Rushdie’s accused attacker took steps to purposely put himself in position to harm Rushdie, getting an advance pass to the event where the author was speaking and arriving a day early bearing a fake ID. “This was a targeted, unprovoked, preplanned attack on Mr Rushdie,” Schmidt alleged.</p> <p>Public defender Nathaniel Barone complained that authorities had taken too long to get Matar in front of a judge while leaving him “hooked up to a bench at the state police barracks”. “He has that constitutional right of presumed innocence,” Barone said.</p> <p>Matar allegedly rushed on stage and stabbed Rushdie repeatedly before being tackled by spectators, institution staffers and two local law enforcement officers providing security. Meanwhile, a helicopter crew flew Rushdie to a hospital in nearby Erie, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>“We are so grateful to all the audience members who bravely leapt to his defence and administrated first aid along with the police and doctors who have cared for him,” Zafar Rushdie’s statement added.</p> <p>The elder Rushdie had 10 knife injuries: three stab wounds to the right front of his neck, another four to his stomach, one each to his right eye and chest and a cut to his right thigh. He emerged with a damaged liver and severed nerves in an arm and an eye, Wylie said on Friday evening.

Writer and longtime friend Ian McEwan called Rushdie “an inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world”, and actor-author Kal Penn cited him as a role model “for an entire generation of artists, especially many of us in the South Asian diaspora toward whom he’s shown incredible warmth”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/12/tsunami-outrage-salman-rushdie-satanic-verses\">A tsunami of outrage: Salman Rushdie and The Satanic Verses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zafar Rushdie’s statement on Sunday said his family was “thankful for the outpouring of love and support from around the world”.</p> <p>A motive for the attack appears to be unclear.

Hezbollah spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Iran’s theocratic government and its state-run media assigned no motive for the stabbing. Iranian authorities have made no public comment about the attack, although hardline state media outlets have celebrated it.</p> <p>In Tehran, some Iranians praised the attack on an author they believe tarnished the Islamic faith, while others worried it would further isolate their country. Many other Iranians expressed their sympathies for Rushdie, posting on social media about their anger at the Islamic Republic’s clerical rulers for issuing the 1989 fatwa against him.</p> <p>Iranian organisations, some linked to the government, have raised a bounty worth millions of dollars for Rushdie’s murder. Khomeini’s successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said as recently as 2019 that the edict remained “irrevocable”.</p> <p>News about the stabbing has led to renewed interest in The Satanic Verses, which topped bestseller lists after the fatwa was issued in 1989.

that is popular especially with Russian tourists, who are now greeted with Ukraine’s anthem when they visit the beauty spot, AFP reports.</p> \n  <p>Finland, which shares 1,300-kilometre (800-mile)

nearby city of <strong>Lappeenranta</strong>, the Ukrainian national anthem is also played every evening above its city hall, overlooking shopping centres popular with Russian tourists.</p> \n  <p>“The aim is to express strong support for Ukraine and to condemn the war of aggression,” Lappeenranta’s mayor <strong>Kimmo Jarva</strong> told AFP.</p> \n  <p>Many Russians visit Lappeenranta to shop for clothes and cosmetics, for example, and Russian number plates can be seen on numerous cars.</p> \n  <p>But tourism from its eastern neighbour has caused discontent in Finland due to the war in Ukraine, with a recent poll showing that 58% of Finns are in favour of restricting Russian tourist visas.</p> \n  <p>As flights from Russia to the EU have been halted, Finland has become a transit country for many Russians seeking to travel further into Europe.</p> \n  <p>“Many saw this as a circumvention of the sanctions regime,” Finland’s foreign minister <strong>Pekka Haavisto</strong> told AFP.</p> \n  <p>Although the Schengen regime and Finnish law do not allow for an outright ban on visas based on nationality, Finland can reduce visa numbers issued based on category, Haavisto noted.</p> \n  <p>“[The] tourism category can be restricted in terms of how many visas can be applied for in a day,” Haavisto said, adding he believed the final decision to adopt the plan could be taken by the end of the month.</p> \n  <p>In late June, Russian president <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/russia-condemns-nato-invitation-finland-sweden\">issued fresh warnings</a> that Russia would respond in kind if Nato set up military infrastructure

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Russian soldiers who shot at the plant or used it as cover would become a “special target”, Reuters reported. He repeated accusations that Moscow was using the plant – Europe’s largest – as nuclear blackmail. The exiled mayor of the town where the plant is located in south-eastern Ukraine said it had come under fresh shelling.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>An explosion was heard in the north-eastern part of Melitopol, </strong>the mayor of the city, Ivan Fedorov, Melitopol, posted on Telegram. “We’re waiting for good news about Russian losses,” he added. The city, which is east of the Dnipro river and north-east of the Crimean peninsula, has been occupied since March.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The two primary road bridges giving access to the pocket of Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnipro in Ukraine’s Kherson region are now probably out of use</strong> for the purposes of substantial Russian military resupply, British military intelligence said on Saturday, which the UK’s defence ministry has described as a key vulnerability.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The number of fatalities after a Russian missile strike on Kramatorsk, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, has grown to three</strong>, the Kyiv Post reports. It cites a report by Ukrinform giving the Kramatorsk mayor, Oleksandr Honcharenko, as the source.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US has said it is concerned by reports of British, Swedish and Croatian nationals being charged by “illegitimate authorities” in eastern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a></strong>. “Russia and its proxies have an obligation to respect international humanitarian law, including the right and protections afforded to prisoners of war,” the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia has warned the US that potentially placing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> on the US State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism could be a diplomatic “point of no return”</strong>, and trigger a total breakdown of relations between the two countries.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian military has reportedly shot down a Russian fighter jet</strong>, as well as four Russian drones, over the past day, according to Ukrainian media.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Two Russian missiles hit Kharkiv</strong> overnight on Saturday, the region’s governor, Oleh Synehubov, said on national television.

The Foreign Office said the oligarch – once considered Russia’s richest man – was targeted because he “continues to amass wealth as he supports Putin’s regime”.</p> <p>It is unclear how the Russian ended up in business with Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Conservative party donor who was appointed as chair of the BBC by Boris Johnson’s government.</p> <p>Sharp’s previously unreported investment in the oligarch’s Atomyze crypto business was made in 2019 through a Cayman Islands company called ABCP GP Ltd. The Cayman Islands are an offshore tax haven known for publishing limited financial documents on who owns businesses.</p> <p>Atomyze uses blockchain technology to trade commodities, especially metals produced by Potanin’s <a href=\"https://www.nornickel.com/company/governance/board-of-management/vladimir-potanin/\">Nornickel</a> company, which dominates the global market for nickel.</p> <p>The future BBC chair subsequently became a company director of Atomyze for two months. Although Sharp has since stepped down from this role, Swiss corporate filings show an individual who works for Sharp’s personal investment office continues to sit on the board of directors.</p> <p>There is no suggestion Sharp has breached any of the recently introduced UK government sanctions, which would prevent ongoing financial dealings with Potanin or his businesses.</p> <p>Sharp was appointed BBC chair after previously giving hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative party. His lengthy career in the City of London included a successful stint as a Goldman Sachs banker – where a young Rishi Sunak worked for him – before he moved into private investments and took senior roles in the British arts scene.</p> <p>His personal wealth is such that he donates his £160,000-a-year salary for the part-time BBC job to charity.</p> <p>Sharp, along with the BBC director general, Tim Davie, and a number of prominent BBC journalists, has been banned by the Russian government from travelling to the country since the invasion of Ukraine due to the British broadcaster’s coverage of the conflict.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sharp’s investment trust said he had “a longstanding interest in a range of emerging technology companies”. They emphasised that no sanctions had been imposed on Potanin when Sharp invested in the oligarch’s company, which is regulated by the Swiss authorities.</p> <p>The spokesperson said Sharp put his investments in a blind trust – an arrangement where financial assets are managed by a third party to avoid conflicts of interests – in May 2020 after being hired as a Treasury adviser by the then chancellor, Sunak.</p> <p>They added: “The arrangement was maintained after Sharp became chairman of the BBC. This blind trust has professionally managed the ABCP GP Ltd and Atomyze Switzerland interests with complete independence from Mr Sharp and at the trust’s sole discretion since its establishment.</p> <p>“At the current time, the blind trust, and therefore Mr Sharp, have no financial or directorial interests in any businesses owned and controlled by Mr Potanin.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-v-west-ham-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T15:12:12Z","webTitle":"Nottingham Forest 1-0 West Ham: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-v-west-ham-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-v-west-ham-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Nottingham Forest 1-0 West Ham: Premier League – as it happened","trailText":"<strong>MBM report:</strong> Taiwo Awoniyi struck for Forest before Declan Rice had a penalty saved by Dean Henderson as Steve Cooper’s men clung on for a win","byline":"Rob Smyth","body":"<div id=\"block-62f910b88f08181373da829c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-14T15:12:12.122Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ben Fisher’s match report </strong>has dropped, so I’ll leave you with that.

I’m not saying this is the most romantic fixture of the weekend, but it’s in the top one: Forest’s first home game in the Premier League since 16 May 1999, when Chris Bart-Williams scored the only goal in a futile victory over Leicester City and – cliché alert - Brennan Johnson hadn’t even been conceived.</p> <p>A helluva lot has changed at Forest since 1999. A helluva lot has changed since May, when they beat Huddersfield in the play-off final. Forest have signed 15 (F-I-F-T-E-etc) players this summer, and there are more to come.</p> <p>Both these teams started the season with 2-0 defeats – Forest at Newcastle, West Ham at home to Beast – so a win wouldn’t go amiss today. But it’s not all about three points. Premier League football is being played at the City Ground again, and the world feels a slightly saner place.</p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>2pm</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFFC/status/1558767736808947712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">An incredible sight 😍 <a href=\"https://t.co/oAFtD1LeKW\">pic.twitter.com/oAFtD1LeKW</a></p>&mdash; Nottingham Forest FC (@NFFC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFFC/status/1558767736808947712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 14, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-14T12:00:22.350Z\">at 1.00pm BST</time></p>  </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-west-ham-premierr-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T15:09:53Z","webTitle":"Awoniyi fires Nottingham Forest to winning return over wasteful West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-west-ham-premierr-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-west-ham-premierr-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Awoniyi fires Nottingham Forest to winning return over wasteful West Ham","trailText":"Taiwo Awoniyi fired Nottingham Forest to a 1-0 victory in their first home game back in the Premier League with Declan Rice missing a second-half penalty for West Ham","byline":"Ben Fisher at the City Ground","body":"<p>How Nottingham Forest, this storied old club, had waited for a moment like this, as they edged out West Ham to savour their first Premier League win in 23 years.

Both teams saw goals disallowed and Declan Rice had a poor second-half penalty saved by Dean Henderson as Taiwo Awoniyi’s first Premier League goal ultimately proved the difference. West Ham could count themselves unfortunate given they also twice hit the woodwork.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-v-west-ham-premier-league-live\">Nottingham Forest 1-0 West Ham: Premier League – live reaction!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forest, then, are up and running. As the old adage goes, strikers do not care how goals go in and Awoniyi’s first in Garibaldi red was scruffy to say the least. The goal stemmed from Harry Toffolo’s surging run and cutback for Jesse Lingard, whose shot was tame enough for Ben Johnson to block, but on the verge of half-time Awoniyi was in the right place at the right time to open his account following a £17m move. Lingard, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/21/jesse-lingard-nottingham-forest-200000-a-week\">turned down West Ham in favour of a move to Forest</a> this summer, started brightly but this gutsy Forest performance was about the collective, a team understandably still gelling. Steve Cooper turned to the Forest fans and clenched both fists. “I talked to the players about how there were probably three generations of supporters here today, one who remember the really good old days,” said Cooper, dedicating victory to supporters who could not get their hands on tickets.</p> <p>In an open letter the Forest chairman, Nicholas Randall, told how the club has no plans to make up the numbers on their return and given how hard it is keep track of the flurry of incomings – the purchase of Neal Maupay looks set to take their spending north of £125m – they do appear to mean business. The France midfielder Houssem Aouar is also close to signing. “I really hope everyone is looking into why we have had to make so many signings and not just put the narrative ‘Forest have signed loads of players: why?’” Cooper said. “There has been a real rationale behind it and [it has been] a real necessity. We would have loved to carried on with the squad from last year and added a few players but it was never going to happen. We are still in that process of becoming the team and the squad that we want to be.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0d9bf9e4c6ee33c6c56e800b489bee31dafe6c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0d9bf9e4c6ee33c6c56e800b489bee31dafe6c8/0_59_2546_1527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Declan Rice looks dejected after missing a penalty for West Ham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Declan Rice looks dejected after missing a penalty for West Ham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forest showed an intent on the pitch, too. Eight of their summer recruits started here, including Orel Mangala and Awoniyi, both of whom were substitutes last weekend. West Ham, by contrast, looked very familiar but for naming two goalkeepers on their bench. Awoniyi provided a welcome focal point and Mangala displayed touches of class, drawing gasps as he half-volleyed a pass wide to the lively Neco Williams, who late on cleared off the line to deny Kurt Zouma an equaliser. Only the water breaks midway through each half brought calm to a frenetic game.</p> <p>David Sullivan, the West Ham co-owner, arrived at the ground in a royal red Rolls-Royce but some Forest supporters took another mode of transport: arriving by boat on the River Trent. The buzz was palpable on an afternoon brimming with lasting images; captains Joe Worrall and Rice standing side by side in a cramped tunnel; the Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis, in a white open-necked shirt, praying for a VAR check to go in their favour before Brennan Johnson’s strike was disallowed; Henderson blowing kisses to the stands after saving low to his right to deny Rice from 12 yards; the sheer noise as Born Slippy, the Trainspotting anthem, blared pre-match. It seemed something was bubbling from the moment Awoniyi won an early corner and David Moyes’s face was etched in frustration as he replayed their oh-so-nears. “We made enough chances to score the goals but we didn’t take them,” he said.</p> <p>West Ham were denied the opening goal after the referee, Robert Jones, was encouraged to visit the VAR monitor, with the former Forest forward Michail Antonio clearly barging into Mangala off the ball in the seconds before Saïd Benrahma slotted into the bottom corner. Pablo Fornals cracked the underside of the crossbar 23 seconds into the second half and shortly after the hour Benrahma curled a free-kick against almost the identical part of the goal frame. Then came West Ham’s best chance, when Scott McKenna was penalised for handball following a VAR check for preventing Tomas Soucek from sweeping Benrahma’s cutback into the net. Rice stepped up but Henderson, in front of the watching Gareth Southgate, went the right way and saved. “I know Dec’s favourite side [on penalties] as I’ve trained with him before [with England],” Henderson said. “I stuck with what I knew and luckily he put it there.”</p> <p>As the Forest supporters gleefully declared before and after the final whistle: Forest are back.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/14/richard-wilson-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T15:09:18Z","webTitle":"Richard Wilson obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/14/richard-wilson-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/14/richard-wilson-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Richard Wilson obituary","trailText":"<strong>Other lives:</strong> Author and journalist who operated in London, Glasgow and Amsterdam","byline":"Angela Neustatter","body":"<p>My friend Richard Wilson, who has died of cancer aged 78, was a journalist who worked at various times as an opinion editor at the Daily Telegraph, a subeditor at the Express and an assistant editor of the Glasgow Herald. He also spent time in Amsterdam as deputy editor of KLM’s airline magazine, and wrote 11 books. </p> <p>Born in Forfar, Scotland, Rick was the son of Harry Wilson, a police sergeant, and Jean (nee McDiarmid), a book-keeper. After attending Montrose academy, at the age of 16 he got a job at the Montrose Standard. A first assignment was interviewing the pop star Wee Willie Harris. Other celebrity interviews led to a job with DC Thomson as a showbiz columnist on a teen magazine: he was bylined Paul Destiny and the column was A Date With Destiny. He became a subeditor on the Scottish Daily Express in 1963, moving to the Fleet Street title in 1966. </p> <p>When in 1970 he was invited to be deputy editor of the Holland Herald, KLM’s in-flight magazine, in Amsterdam, it seemed a bold move, but he fell in love with the city, living in a canalside flat with high windows, and was given the chance to interview John Lennon and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/10/guardianobituaries.filmnews1\">Rod Steiger</a>. He returned to London in 1974 to become managing editor of Time and Tide magazine, but took the chance to return to Amsterdam as deputy editor from 1978 to 1980 of the English-language magazine Holland Life.</p> <p>I met him when I worked for a couple of years at the Holland Herald. An enduring memory of mine is of Rick performing a highland fling along an Amsterdam canal with Ken Wilkie, the editor. It was a joyous, anarchic time; we filled the magazine with offbeat and quirky stories and tips on the best coffee shops, and drank large amounts of genever (gin).</p> <p>In 1980 Rick became founding editor of the Scotsman’s colour magazine. He left the Scotsman in 1990 to become deputy op-ed editor at the Daily Telegraph. In 1992 he went to the Glasgow Herald as assistant editor until 1998.</p> <p>Later he freelanced as a writer and subeditor, and he never officially retired. His 11 books included biographies of the castaway Alexander Selkirk and of Robert Fergusson, the young poet who inspired Robert Burns, and four novels.</p> <p>Richard is survived by his second wife, Alison (nee Graham), whom he married in 1984, and their children, Charli and Harry, and seven grandchildren, and by his son Christiaan, from his first marriage, to Johanna Blankestijn, which ended in divorce.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/14/house-freezing-life-blackouts-1970s-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T15:00:12Z","webTitle":"‘The house was freezing’: life during blackouts of 1970s Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/14/house-freezing-life-blackouts-1970s-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/14/house-freezing-life-blackouts-1970s-britain","fields":{"headline":"‘The house was freezing’: life during blackouts of 1970s Britain","trailText":"With winter power cuts a possibility amid energy crisis, some Britons remember them as ‘very ordinary’","byline":"Tobi Thomas","body":"<p>When Judy Young first saw the government’s response to concerns over power supplies could be potential blackouts this winter, her first thought was: “Thank God I haven’t got young children any more.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, it was reported that under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario” plan, Britain could experience several days of blackouts in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/09/uks-energy-crisis-response-could-include-winter-power-cuts\">January if the country is short of power.</a></p> <p>Young, a retired headteacher and now portrait painter who lives in Herefordshire, said the blackouts of the 1970s were particularly challenging with her two very young children.</p> <p>“It was difficult being in a blackout with young children who you can never take your eyes off even for a second, especially not if you’ve got candles all over the place,” she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64471a74d543dd717b711dac9dafb3cde905ec12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64471a74d543dd717b711dac9dafb3cde905ec12/0_0_454_568/400.jpg\" alt=\"Judy Young with her then husband and two children\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Young with her then husband and two children in the 1970s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judy Young</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The house was freezing and it was dangerous with such small children to have any kind of oil heater which they could burn their fingers on.”</p> <p>She says that during the electricity blackouts, the family had to quickly adjust to the fact that they might be left without power for hours, and so make the most of the time in which the electricity was on, including cooking when they were able to. </p> <p>But despite the difficulties, she remembers the amusement the children felt at the time.</p> <p>“I can still in my mind picture their small faces, smiling with excitement at the thought of having their meals as picnics in the sitting room, and having their baths in a tin bath in front of the fire,” Young says. “They loved it. After the power cut, they used to beg for it to happen again. They didn’t remember being so cold and miserable.”</p> <p>Chris Lilly, a 69-year-old retired teacher, remembers experiencing a power cut while watching Live Like Pigs by John Arden at the Royal Court theatre as a drama student in 1973.</p> <p>“At the beginning of the play, they told us that they were expecting a power cut, and they were happy to go ahead if we were too,” Lilly says. “Then they gave half a dozen of us on the front row torches, and the play progressed.</p> <p>“Everything was going swimmingly, and then the lights cut out, and that’s when we had to turn on our torches,” Lilly recalls. “It was kind of like blitz spirit.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c794155b37c5e02f1b06b91a0297aaa3364f7c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c794155b37c5e02f1b06b91a0297aaa3364f7c0/11_0_1837_2295/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Lilly as a student\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Lilly in the 1970s: ‘It was kind of like blitz spirit.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Lilly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the thought of having to rely on torches while at the theatre may seem bizarre nowadays, at the time it was nothing unusual for Lilly. “The blackouts were very matter of fact, it was very ordinary,” he says. “There were power cuts, and you were told when the power cuts would be in the newspaper, so you could accommodate to that.”</p> <p>Jenifer Gould, a local councillor who grew up in Dorset, was a child at the time of the 1970s blackouts. Experiencing them was so formative for her that as an adult she always makes sure there are candles in the house.</p> <p>“Lighting the candles when we lost the electricity has just stuck in my mind,” she says. “Without having a huge idea about what the power cut really was, and why it was happening, we knew something was going on when the candles came out.”</p> <p>Gould remembers that the blackouts felt like a “normal thing”.</p> <p>“I don’t remember it being a big issue, because we didn’t just rely on electricity. We had a radio with batteries, and we had gas cooking,” Gould says. “It never felt like a shock when it happened, and I don’t remember my parents making a big fuss whenever it happened. It almost felt fun, and a bit exciting.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/14/satanic-verses-pakistan-bookshop-what-happened","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T14:47:31Z","webTitle":"What it was like asking for Salman Rushdie’s work in a Pakistan bookshop | Anonymous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/satanic-verses-pakistan-bookshop-what-happened","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/14/satanic-verses-pakistan-bookshop-what-happened","fields":{"headline":"What it was like asking for Salman Rushdie’s work in a Pakistan bookshop","trailText":"As an aspiring writer I loved many exiled authors, from Márquez to Kundera, but with Rushdie the stakes were raised","byline":"Anonymous","body":"<p>It was more than a decade ago when I was introduced to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/who-is-salman-rushdie-author-whose-book-the-satanic-verses-made-him-a-target\">work of Salman Rushdie</a>, thanks to the recommendation of a writer in my homeland of Pakistan. As an aspiring writer myself, I was always told that to become really good, you have to “read, read and read”. Yet I often found I had already read the authors who were recommended to me, easily available as their works were in my country.</p> <p>But when a writer insisted I must read Rushdie, the stakes were raised. I loved many writers living in exile, from Márquez to Kundera. But Rushdie was the first writer for me who had caused so much anger in the Muslim world and enraged some fanatics.</p> <p>That his books were banned in my country and the mere mention of his name was thought to be a sin only increased my curiosity. As I was to discover, just getting hold of a copy of one of his works, let alone reading the texts, had become an illicit pleasure for many young people of my generation.</p> <p>To access his books, someone recommended visiting a specific bookstore in Pakistan. In a hair-raising exchange that felt as though I were looking to buy illegal drugs, I went and whispered into the bookseller’s ear that I needed the books of Rushdie.</p> <p>The bookseller responded that he would get me all the author’s books but each would cost at least 20,000 rupees (£75). The cost of The Satanic Verses would be triple, given the risk he was taking by selling it; in effect, the vendor said, a death sentence if caught.</p> <p>I could not afford the cost, so I ended up reading Rushdie online. Then, during a foreign trip, I was finally able to buy hard copies.</p> <p>On my way back to Pakistan, trying to wrap his books in my luggage so no one could discover them, I felt as if I was smuggling explosives. I asked myself: what if they catch me with his books? Will I be sentenced to life imprisonment? Anything can happen here; it is Pakistan, I murmured to myself.</p> <p>But I didn’t have The Satanic Verses with me, and did not actually like the book. I am sure most of the fanatics who wished him dead have not actually read him. Certainly not his entire works – be it Midnight’s Children or Haroun and the Sea of Stories. Or his underrated masterpiece Shame, which I especially enjoyed and felt spoke so well about everything that is wrong with Pakistan.</p> <p>Rushdie talks about arrests for the mere guilt of knowing a “wrong” person. He wrote down the story of a poet friend who spent many months in jail for “social reasons”. He writes: “That is to say he knew somebody who knew somebody who was the wife of the second cousin by marriage of the step-uncle of somebody who might or might not have shared a flat with someone who was running guns to the guerrillas in Baluchistan. You can get anywhere in Pakistan if you know people, even into the jail.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/14/saudi-aramco-profits-soar-by-90-per-cent-as-energy-prices-rise-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T14:47:19Z","webTitle":"Saudi Aramco profits soar by 90% as energy prices rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/14/saudi-aramco-profits-soar-by-90-per-cent-as-energy-prices-rise-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/14/saudi-aramco-profits-soar-by-90-per-cent-as-energy-prices-rise-oil","fields":{"headline":"Saudi Aramco profits soar by 90% as energy prices rise","trailText":"The $48bn figure from world’s biggest oil firm is thought to be one of largest quarterly profits in history","byline":"Kalyeena Makortoff","body":"<p>Saudi Arabia’s largely state-owned energy firm has highlighted the colossal profits made by gas and oil-rich nations during the energy crisis by revealing profits in the three months to the end of June up 90% to $48bn (£40bn).</p> <p>Saudi Aramco recorded what is believed to be one of the largest quarterly profits in history to easily beat the near $26bn it made a year earlier.</p> <p>The world’s biggest oil company, which is 95% owned by the Saudi Arabian government, becomes the latest oil producer to benefit from soaring energy prices linked to the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>It is thought to be one of the largest quarterly profits in history, when disregarding one-off increases that tend to inflate company earnings, and is Aramco’s highest since its shares were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/11/saudi-aramco-shares-soar-as-it-becomes-world-largest-listed-company\">listed on Riyadh’s stock market</a> in December 2019.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/12/uk-fuel-exports-netherlands-hmrc-data-russia\">UK fuel exports to Netherlands up by 67% in June, data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aramco said the results reflected “increasing demand” and the fact that its costs have remained low.

This was a remarkable period of British entrepreneurial endeavour, when a handful of talented, greedy and fearless businessmen changed the face of shopping in Britain.</p> <p>His brands, Top Shop (which became Topshop), Principles, Top Man and several others within the Burton Group, became legendary in the industry. At its peak in the mid-80s, Burton Group was taking one pound in every eight spent on clothing in Britain – only Marks &amp; Spencer could claim more. Yet, within a few years, the group had passed its apex – its share of the market was in decline and in 1990 Halpern was the victim of a boardroom coup.</p> <p>In many ways, Halpern got what he deserved, both the good and the bad. He was variously feted or otherwise as the first British businessman to collect a £1m-plus pay packet, a keep-fit fanatic who had a £2m gymnasium built in the basement of Burton Group’s headquarters and, thanks to the kiss-and-tell stories of a model named Fiona Wright in 1987, a man with a voracious sexual appetite.</p> <p>An inspired despot who, like so many of his peers, believed himself to be a genius, Halpern was a man with an exceptional feel for retailing. He rightly saw that the shops that would be most successful in parting young people from their money needed three ingredients: flair, theatre and value. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbfbad6a0718ead50a23612b1e3d8ceb53193f67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbfbad6a0718ead50a23612b1e3d8ceb53193f67/136_21_1993_3038/656.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Halpern was a keep-fit fanatic who had a £2m gymnasium built in the basement of Burton Group’s headquarters.\" width=\"656\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Halpern was a keep-fit fanatic who had a £2m gymnasium built in the basement of Burton Group’s headquarters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Cross/Daily Mail/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, he was a flawed genius, for he courted danger, seemed obsessed with gaining the favours of young women and took short cuts with his accounts which, although legal, gave a somewhat inflated view of the real bottom line. In time, each of these flaws contributed to his humiliating, but profitable, ejection from the Burton Group, which he had transformed from a dull manufacturer of suits for the working man into one of the most famous retail chains of the era.</p> <p>Halpern had dedicated most of his working life to the business, having joined Montague Burton, then run by Cyril Spencer, which made men’s suits in a string of factories in the north of England, in 1961. He steadily worked his way up the management ladder and, in 1970, co-founded Top Shop, a boutique-style chain aimed at teenagers and young women. It was Burton’s first venture into the high fashion industry, and was so successful that it was soon followed by other “stand-alone” chains.</p> <p>Three years later, he acquired Dorothy Perkins. As the old suit factories were closed and sold, so the portfolio of brands operating under the Burton Group grew. Top Shop was followed by Top Man, while Evans was turned into a store for women of all sizes.</p> <p>These were halcyon days for Halpern. His reputation both inside and outside the company was riding high and in 1977 he became group chief executive. Four years later he made it to the chairman’s office when he unseated Spencer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0254f0e2579a81f843604060c443a9d949760d00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0254f0e2579a81f843604060c443a9d949760d00/1280_33_1730_2162/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Halpern in Debenhams, Oxford Street, which he transformed from a dowdy department store to a light-filled ‘exciting’ retail space\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Halpern in Debenhams, Oxford Street, which he transformed from a dowdy department store to a light-filled ‘exciting’ retail space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Cross/Daily Mail/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1985, at the height of Thatcher’s reign, Halpern fought a bitter battle for control of Debenhams, a dowdy department store group. He teamed up with Sir Terence Conran, the designer and businessman behind Habitat, and the two of them starred in a video presentation sent to every Debenhams shareholder. The video showed how Debenhams could be brought into the 20th century, with glass escalators, atriums and retail excitement on every floor.</p> <p>The bitter takeover brought him into contact with Gerald Ronson, a property developer who wanted a slice of the development potential inherent in the Debenhams portfolio; he played a crucial part in the success of the bid. It was said that Ronson was the only man Halpern feared, although it was never quite clear why. The share transactions that delivered Halpern his prize were later investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry, which found no evidence of wrongdoing.</p> <p>During all this period, Burton Group was making use of a legitimate accounting device under which new outlets added to a retailer’s portfolio could “write off” a substantial proportion of their costs during the first year, rather than, as is usual, charge the costs against profits.</p> <p>Sooner or later this was bound to catch up with reality and the true underlying profitability would be exposed. At the same time, Halpern plunged the Burton Group into property development, going ahead with shopping centre developments that were neither permanently financed nor fully pre-let.</p> <p>By the late 80s, a number of institutional shareholders and City investment analysts were beginning to feel uneasy about the group’s financial situation. Halpern hated the City and made enemies of many in whose hands his future at the group was held. He believed that so long as he delivered rising profits and dividends, he should run the company as he pleased. But a generous share option scheme for him and his fellow directors was introduced at the wrong time, when the going was already getting tough and, although modified, left a chasm of distrust between Halpern and his shareholders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99e46f7d6eb15a99b10aa3fcdd26ce68431d491a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99e46f7d6eb15a99b10aa3fcdd26ce68431d491a/0_354_4815_2889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Halpern with his wife Joan and daughter Jennifer in 1987, the year he was exposed in a kiss-n-tell story as the ‘five-times-a-night Burton boss’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Halpern with his wife Joan and daughter Jennifer in 1987, the year he was exposed in a kiss-n-tell story as the ‘five-times-a-night Burton boss’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Lovelace/ANL/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Determined to the point of ruthlessness, his style was to ride roughshod over anyone who opposed him either within the company or outside, and his supposed visionary grasp of the fashion industry allowed him to get away with it.</p> <p>Only days after the Fiona Wright story broke in the News of the World with claims that they had sex five times a night, Halpern was described by a Burton shareholder at the annual general meeting as the “second greatest Englishman, after Churchill”. Knighted in 1986, he travelled in the Burton Group’s private helicopter and made use of executive jets as others made use of trains. Wherever he went, he was accorded celebrity status.</p> <p>After the kiss-and-tell exposure, the knives were out for the “five-times-a-night Burton boss”. Even then, however, it was said that he secretly enjoyed the notoriety, and still believed himself untouchable.</p> <p>Born in London to Olga and Bernard Halpern, who had fled from Austria to escape the Nazis, Ralph grew up in Belsize Park and Hampstead, north London, and attended St Christopher school in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire. After leaving he worked for his father’s textile firm before becoming a trainee at Selfridges, then joining Peter Robinson, part of Montague Burton.</p> <p>For a man who had devoted nearly all his working life to the Burton Group (renamed Arcadia in 1998), his ejection nearly 30 years later was the bitterest of blows. However, Halpern had prepared well for his exit.</p> <p>He had set up a pension scheme the contributions to which were based not just on his basic salary, but his total remuneration. Thus he left with an index-linked pension of more than £500,000-a-year for life.

The company has pedigree with Leonard Bernstein’s flawed masterpiece: the definitive “<a href=\"https://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Leonard-Bernstein-Candide-Scottish-Opera-version/7651\">Scottish Opera version</a>” was created with the maestro’s protege, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/24/facing-the-music-conductor-john-mauceri\">John Mauceri</a>, at the helm and Bernstein himself overseeing in Glasgow in the late 80s.</p> <p>If that was a thoroughly traditional affair, all big wigs and bigger frocks, then Jack Furness’s brilliant and bold new production takes an entirely fresh look at the piece. Staged as a promenade performance in a marquee in the company’s production studios – the setting for last summer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/05/falstaff-review-scottish-opera-david-mcvicar-pranks-and-pathos\">memorable Falstaff</a> – this production reimagines Candide for the social media age. It’s a brilliant conceit: the glib superficiality of Dr Pangloss’s philosophy that “this is the best of all possible worlds” is a perfect fit for the vacuous nature of an age of reality TV and Instagram celebrity. At the same time, the series of disasters that befall the hapless Candide and his companions – war, religious persecution, slavery and violence – remain all too relevant today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e02266acc5b1bbf1e8d7819204f09fff987ea97d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e02266acc5b1bbf1e8d7819204f09fff987ea97d/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Perfect fit … Ronald Samm as Dr Pangloss.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfect fit … Ronald Samm as Dr Pangloss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Glossop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a totally immersive production in which the action takes place around, above and through the audience, the visual focus shifting as the action moves from one location to the next. Particularly powerful is the use of the community choir, flashmob style, blurring the boundaries between performers and audience. Turning the narrator figure (intended to be the author Voltaire) into a series of TV anchors and journalists works superbly, as the action is captured in real time by the video cameras of the press.</p> <p>The visual spectacle of the production is underwritten by some fantastic musicality – no mean feat given that the Orchestra of Scottish Opera is fixed in position as the action romps across the space. With the use of cameras and a couple of assistant directors, conductor Stuart Stratford ensures the action moves forward with unerring pace. He’s aided by a series of superbly sung and characterised performances from his cast. Ronald Samm is a flamboyantly scarlet-suited Dr Pangloss, as much a celebrity as the young people he instructs: William Morgan’s wide-eyed Candide; Paula Sides’ slinky Cunegonde (whose set piece Glitter and Be Gay is a tour de force); and Dan Shelvey’s seductively androgynous Maximilian. Susan Bullock and Jamie MacDougall have a lot fun as the old woman and a rogues gallery of senior men respectively while Lea Shaw is suitably coquettish as the wily servant Paquette.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf16784a57b592e623b56a6c42165da44088178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdf16784a57b592e623b56a6c42165da44088178/0_100_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Shelvey as Maximillian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seductive … the community choir with Dan Shelvey as Maximillian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Glossop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all its humour and witty one-liners, Candide’s subject matter is strong stuff – sensitively handled here, although not glossed over.

Instead, they were continuing and even intensifying collaborations with other European countries.</p> <p>“Theatres and other cultural institutions gave a good example by keeping collaborations going on with European artists when there was Brexit. They didn’t stop it,” Van Hove, 63, told the<em> Observer</em>.</p> <p>“Nobody stopped a collaboration. On the contrary, they intensified a lot of collaborations. The theatre and the arts worlds are a very good example to the politicians [of how] to keep it open.”</p> <p>Van Hove has been leading the way.

But that’s my opinion,” he said, adding the caveat that he was a Belgian living in Amsterdam and working in London. But he believes that many artists in the capital feel the same way.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, his collaborations with British theatres continued through Brexit. While “it’s a little bit more difficult to get to London” than it was, the problems were not insurmountable.</p> <p>British theatre producers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/sonia-friedman\" title=\"\">Sonia Friedman</a>, the “super producer” behind the worldwide hit <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/26/harry-potter-cursed-child-review-palace-theatre-london\" title=\"\">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a></em> and <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, which transferred from Broadway to the West End in March, have continued to “behave the same way they did before”, he said. “Nothing changed for me there.”</p> <p>As he prepares to reprise his production of <em>A Little Life</em>, which will be performed in Dutch with English subtitles, he admitted he was originally reluctant to read the lengthy 2015 novel which follows the lives of university friends Jude, Malcolm, Willem and JB, and tackles subjects including trauma, abuse and suicide.</p> <p>Although he had seen its famous cover, which features the black-and-white Peter Hujar photograph <em>Orgasmic Man</em>, in bookshops around New York, where he was working at the time, he thought it was “just another gay coming-of-age story”. But after it was recommended to him separately by two of his best friends, he felt compelled to read it. Soon after, he was sucked into its “dark abyss” and couldn’t look away.</p> <p>In another turn of fate, just as he started looking into the logistics of bringing the novel to stage a month later, he received a third copy of the book – this time from Yanagihara – with a “beautiful” note telling him she would be “honoured” if he adapted it.</p> <p>“I was shocked by it, I was devastated by it, I loved it at the same time,” he said. “Just that she cared, that Hanya cared, to tell a story so cruel but that you can’t get away from. That’s the strange thing about the novel – you can’t get away from it. Even when you want to stop, you just can’t stop reading it. A miracle.”</p> <p>What attracted him to the story was the description of abuse – “I never saw a description so haunting, so precise, so detailed” – and its story of friendship.</p> <p>“I think it tells us that love doesn’t conquer all. That love is not the ultimate solution to things so deep, so hurtful as a traumatic sexual experience.”</p> <p>For a long time, he has been unable to take the production to the UK or other English-speaking countries due to a rights issue. As reported by the <em>Observer</em> in February, the novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/27/the-best-tv-series-never-made-script-for-a-little-life-has-been-rejected-by-everyone\" title=\"\">was going to be made into a television series</a>.</p> <p>Now he is finally able to take it to the Edinburgh festival, which he describes as “one of the greatest festivals in the world”, before taking it “home” to Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York in October.</p> <p>Despite being a time of crisis – from the cost of living to pandemics, the climate and war in Ukraine – he said the story remained timeless and universal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/01/ivo-van-hove-ita-internationaal-theater-amsterdam-shocking-theatre\">‘How many litres of blood do we need?’: Ivo van Hove’s ITA on 20 years of shocking theatregoers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Of course we live in times of war, depression, financial crisis, a crisis in nature, things like that, but people still go to the theatre to connect deeply to other human beings,” he said. “To go to a ritual.

I first became aware of the short, sharp bang emanating from a hatchback in the middle of the road while standing outside Blackhorse Road station last week. I say standing, but I was really hunkered on my ankles attempting to commiserate with my son as he screamed in my face.</p> <p>He’d been crying for about 40 minutes, in an unbroken tirade. It began as we were leaving the park. His friend Eusebio (whose name has been changed, in the manner of a much more serious article, to emphasise how stressful this was) was showing off his shiny new toy car, one we knew very well since we have the exact same one at home. It’s a small blue sports car that kind of turns into a Triceratops. You might even say it transforms into one, had its manufacturers not gone to great lengths to avoid any such language.</p> <p>My son became convinced that this was not merely the same make of car as his own, but the very vehicle, which Eusebio had stolen, and presumably cleaned considerably. My attempts to dissuade him of this fell short, and soon he was crying profusely and I was escorting him from the park while apologising to Eusebio and his mother for the screamed accusations of minor theft auto.</p> <p>His crying lasted all the way to Seven Sisters tube and for the entirety of our two-stop jaunt. In transit, I felt that cold, penetrating gaze you only get when every single person in a train carriage is trying their best to look anywhere but in the direction of a screaming, red-faced child and his sweaty, grinning dad.</p> <p>Any attempt at being myself goes out the window. Having 80 fellow passengers watching me through the bottom 2% of their eyes makes me stiff and performative. I say beige, neutral things like, ‘It’s OK,’ and ‘Calm down, darling,’ not for my son’s benefit, but so that our audience will write me a favourable report in the parenting survey I presume they’re all drafting in their heads. As the doors close behind me at Blackhorse Road, I trundle my portable noise machine down the platform, feeling a dart of horrid envy for the newly quiet carriage and the visibly relieved inhabitants now pulling away.</p> <p>On the pavement outside, a small crowd is taking no notice of my screaming son, since they’ve noticed smoke billowing from the bonnet of an approaching car. I am oblivious to that vehicle and focused on another. My wife is video-calling from my son’s bedroom, holding his triceratops-mobile up to her phone, so he can see he’s been crying in error.</p> <p>The man on the road has run out of his car, which is now fully on fire. My son doesn’t even look as four fire engines rush toward the scene. ‘You bought that in a shop!’ he says to his deceitful mother, ‘It’s not the same car.’ The car on the road gives off a large bang, which finally catches his attention. It’s as blue as a Triceratops, and wreathed in eager flames. He’ll resume crying soon enough, but for a few glorious minutes he is silent, entranced perhaps by something more combustible than he is.</p> <p><em>Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

Quoting an enigmatic utterance of the prophet (“I sense the breath of the Merciful coming from Yemen”), he speculates that the “Yemen” in question is not just the region in the Arabian peninsula, but possibly also the popular Indian raga of the same name. These days, such an innocuous interpretation, linking the founder of Islam to northern Indian music, is certain to incite charges of blasphemy, and perhaps even calls for assassination, across many Muslim populations.</p> <p>But it would have been uncontroversial, even unremarkable, during much of the last millennium, the centuries during which India was the world’s busiest crossroads, receiving and transmitting cultural influences between east and west, north and south. Artists and thinkers in this time, when India played easy-going host to a polyphony of identities, were oblivious to today’s hotly invoked distinctions of religion and gender. For instance, the 14th-century Sufi poet Amir Khusrau wrote qawwali, a poetic form derived from Arabic chants, using a female persona and with imagery derived from the cult of the Hindu god Krishna. Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, India’s most influential yogi in the 19th century, not only practised both Islam and Christianity; he spent many years dressed as, and imagining himself to be, a woman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c237f9ff4d678b4c9ea6aae218c131fa30597126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c237f9ff4d678b4c9ea6aae218c131fa30597126/0_0_2696_3600/749.jpg\" alt=\"Dividing Line by Zarina Hashmi, an Indian-American artist whose family was displaced by partition. \" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dividing Line by Zarina Hashmi, an Indian-American artist whose family was displaced by partition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farzad Owrang/© Zarina; Courtesy of artist and Luhring Augustine, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such resourceful creativity helped pre-modern south Asians build a syncretic and broadly pluralistic society.

Botched products of Britain’s imperialist skulduggery – and fierce struggles for personal power between leaders of the anti-imperialist movement – the new nations were locked right from their birth into military conflict; their pitiless “identity politics” ranges today from intellectual forgeries in history textbooks to the lynching of religious minorities.</p> <p>The political history of their 75 years – marked by several wars, arms races, anti-minority pogroms, authoritarian rule, and minimal protections for the poor and weak – provokes mostly despair and foreboding. While Pakistan nears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/15/pakistanis-told-to-drink-less-tea-amid-economic-crisis\">economic collapse</a>, Indian fantasies of becoming a superpower lie shattered amid shrivelled growth and ecological calamity. Demagogues in both nuclear-armed countries treacherously exploit the resulting anger and disaffection. While claiming to fulfil the broken promises of modernity, they mobilise the thwarted energies of individual and collective aggrandisement into a mass politics of fear and loathing.</p> <p>Hopes for a survivable present and viable future depend a great deal on how we understand our inheritance – the long, deep, and still alive past of the Indian subcontinent. Violence and brutality were hardly unknown to it: cities were sacked, massacres and rapes were perpetrated on ordinary people, and places of worship desecrated. Yet it would plainly be a mistake to uphold the parched present of India and Pakistan as evidence of progress in history, and to scorn their shared past as barbaric or backward. For there are millennia-old traditions in the subcontinent that continue to exemplify coexistence, compassion, and even love – in short, every major human value that has gone missing from modern power-crazed ideologies of race, religion, ethnicity, nation and civilisation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/global-hit-pasoori-opens-doors-for-pakistani-pop\">Global hit Pasoori opens doors for Pakistani pop</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moreover, that pre-modern past of south Asia, in which individuals had multiple, overlapping identities, is not dead; it is not even the past. It throbs vigorously in the hearts and souls of hundreds of millions of us, turning up unannounced in our everyday lives, lingering in our words, food, clothes, customs, songs.</p> <p>Our folk religions and cultures, which millions of <em>desis</em> still practise, have never been defined by such quintessentially modern and narrow political oppositions as “Hindu” versus “Muslim”. In the Pakistani town of Sehwan, devotees at the <em>dargāh</em> of the 13th-century Sufi saint La’l Shabāz Qalandar still perform rituals of love mysticism dating back to the ancient temple to Shiva that once stood on the very site. Even young urban south Asians, radicalised by WhatsApp forwards and YouTube videos, are quick to discard their flashy nationalist identities when presented with narratives that offer a deeper, richer existence. A barrage of Islamophobic films from Bollywood has indoctrinated tens of millions of Indians into hatred of Muslims and Pakistanis. Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/global-hit-pasoori-opens-doors-for-pakistani-pop\">Pasoori</a>, a recent song by Ali Sethi that celebrates syncretic identities, became one of the biggest-ever musical successes in India, including among peoples unacquainted with its Punjabi and Urdu idioms.</p> <p>These are not isolated examples. Growing up in countries periodically at war with each other, we – the authors of this essay – actively sought contemporary writers, artists and musicians across the border.

Stepping into the breach, popular culture and art from the south Asian diaspora has taken to vivifying the shared experience of Indians and Pakistanis: in the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/20/ms-marvel-superhero-second-gen-pakistani-women-like-me\">Ms Marvel</a> TV series, the heroine is a Pakistani Muslim teenager from New Jersey, and the storyline revolves around the collective trauma of partition, turning the pain of Hindus and Muslims into a universally relatable tragedy.</p> <p>No other longstanding conflict, whether between North and South Korea or Israel and Palestine, offers such examples of profound affinities across ferociously policed borders. Nowhere else in the world do emotional and philosophical capacities generously flourishing in inner lives over centuries continue to subvert the modern political ultimatum to conform to a brutally monolithic identity.</p> <p>As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of partition, it is abundantly clear to us that politics in India and Pakistan are doomed to keep forging a history of irresolvable enmity between Hindus and Muslims. It is also clear that any reasonable hope for peace between these two nuclear powers cannot rest on a political and economic breakthrough alone. We can avoid an apocalyptic scenario only if we acknowledge and consolidate, or at least not squander, the linked cultural and spiritual inheritance of the two countries. The great truth it underscores repeatedly – of the plural and interdependent nature of human identity – is the best remedy for our rancorously polarised worlds.</p> <ul> <li><p>Pankaj Mishra is a novelist and essayist from India; Ali Sethi is a writer and musician from Pakistan</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As one of the last homes of the ground-nesting crested lark in Germany, the local district is eager to protect their three remaining breeding pairs. Consequently, they have ordered residents to <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/news/why-this-small-german-town-is-putting-every-single-cat-into-lockdown-052622\">lock their cats indoors</a> over the summer for the next three years, or face hefty fines: €500 (£420) if a cat is caught outside; €50,000 if it takes an endangered lark.</p> <p>“I’m really glad that’s happening,” says Peter P Marra, an ecologist at Georgetown University in the US and one of the authors of the 2016 book <em><a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691167411/cat-wars\">Cat Wars: </a>The Devastating Consequences of a Cuddly Killer</em>. This kind of policy is the right approach, he says, “but we shouldn’t wait until it’s down to a few individual birds.” In his opinion, no domestic cats should be out in the environment, anywhere.</p> <p>In the US, the debate about free-roaming cats has been raging for years. Marra’s own work has shown that cats – mostly feral but also pets – kill <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380/?mod=article_inline&amp;fbclid=IwAR\">billions of US birds and mammals</a> every year. And while it’s <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7909512/\">primarily motivated</a> by perceived risks from coyotes and traffic, <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jaae/2/1/article-p7_3.xml\">70% of US cat owners</a> now keep their cats inside, up from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1558787814000884#bib1\">35%</a> in the late 1990s.</p> <p>UK cat owners feel differently: about 70% let their cats out, a similar percentage to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7909512/\">other European countries</a>. Access to the great outdoors is considered good for cats’ wellbeing, a position shared by charities such as Cats Protection and Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home, and there are few predators to worry about. The EU has even declared that it believes in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oddities-environment-europe-cats-wildlife-2ea2d3edea304defa0375a7dbedc35ae\">free movement of cats</a>. “It’s a massive societal difference [from the US],” says Robbie McDonald, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Exeter.</p> <p>But cats are prolific hunters of wildlife in the UK and Europe too. A study published in April estimated that UK cats kill <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204621003017#b0135\">160 to 270 million</a> animals annually, a quarter of them birds. The real figure is likely to be even higher, as the study used the 2011 pet cat population of 9.5 million; it is now closer to <a href=\"https://www.pfma.org.uk/statistics\">12 million</a>, boosted by the pandemic pet craze. Seen alongside drops in bird numbers <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2021-11-survey-huge-bird-population-europe.html\">across the EU</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/09/sixteen-of-britains-top-20-garden-birds-have-declined-in-number-annual-survey-finds\">the UK</a>, it is “quite alarming”, says lead author and cat ecologist Tara Pirie from the University of Reading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4040e48be51f43f1f3f2ed4c6547b9451d87eb24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4040e48be51f43f1f3f2ed4c6547b9451d87eb24/0_0_1743_2255/773.jpg\" alt=\"an illustration by john gerrard keulemans of lyall’s wren, traversia lyalli\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lyall’s wren, Traversia lyalli. Within a year of cats arriving on Stephens Island, the species’s last stronghold, it was extinct.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: John Gerrard Keulemans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such worrying numbers have now prompted the charity SongBird Survival to launch their <a href=\"https://www.songbird-survival.org.uk/friends-not-food\">“Friends Not Food” campaign</a>, hoping to inspire cat owners to take action and limit hunting. So is it time to reconsider the British laissez-faire attitude to free-roaming cats? According to researchers, the science on cats’ impact is far from settled – but the answer is still yes.</p> <p>It is well established that cats can have serious impacts on wildlife and even cause extinctions. The most famous example is Lyall’s wren, a small, flightless bird that once lived on Stephens Island, New Zealand. When Europeans arrived on the island in the late 1800s, they brought their cats, and probably within the year, Lyall’s wren was gone.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/the-obituary-of-the-stephens-island-wren/\">This story opens</a> Marra’s book. In it, he argues that the domestic cat is not just an invasive species on small Pacific islands, but pretty much everywhere. As such, it puts native wildlife at risk wherever it is. “The evidence is so clear,” says Marra. “I’ve analysed it every way possible.”</p> <p>In the UK and the rest of Europe, however, cat invasions happened a long time ago. Cats were brought from the Fertile Crescent to south-eastern Europe <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-house-cats-158390681/\">several thousand years</a> ago, and then introduced to Britain <a href=\"https://archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/archaeology-of-the-domestic-cat.htm\">by the Romans</a>. “We’ve had a much longer history of dealing with any impact that they may have had,” says Philip Baker, a mammalogist at the University of Reading, adding that Britain and Europe have had native wildcats <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mam.12150\">for millennia</a>. “There’s at least some evolutionary history of that kind of predator that prey species would have evolved alongside.”</p> <p>The problem, Pirie says, is “the sheer number” of domestic cats. On average, a British pet cat brings home around five items of prey a year. Researchers estimate this is about 23% of their actual kills, which makes it about 22 kills a year. Multiplied by the number of pet cats, it is clearly a huge number of lives lost. If you compare this with the collective population of native wild predators such as stoats and pine martens, Pirie says, cats “outnumber them something like fivefold”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Should the British adopt the American way and ditch free roaming? It may already be happening </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though the relationship between how many cats live in an area and how many birds they take is not straightforward – for example, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204621003017#b0270\">cats roam less</a> when surrounded by neighbouring cats – there is evidence that when cat numbers go up, so do cat kills. A large <a href=\"https://bioone.org/journals/ardea/volume-107/issue-1/arde.v107i1.a6/Domestic-Cat-Predation-on-Garden-Birds--An-Analysis-from/10.5253/arde.v107i1.a6.short\">2019 study</a> found that the number of garden birds killed by cats in France and Belgium has increased by more than 50% in 15 years, alongside an increase in those countries’ pet cat populations.</p> <p>And while many birds visit gardens, conservationists are particularly worried about wild areas like forests and heathland, which are home to vulnerable species such as Dartford warblers and nightjars. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204621003017#b0270\">Pirie’s study</a>, which used GPS trackers to map how cats roamed around Reading, showed that cats living next to natural habitats visit them regularly. This means that although it is mostly urban birds such as robins and blue tits that encounter cats, rural species could be at risk, too.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>It sounds bad, but not everyone is convinced that cats are actually putting bird populations under pressure. “The kneejerk reaction is that they must be having some sort of impact – they’re killing millions and millions,” says Baker. However, numbers can be deceptive. According to Baker, the birds most hunted by cats have so many young that they can afford to lose a lot of them. In the UK, he says: “I just categorically say there is no evidence of an impact.”</p> <p>The UK’s largest bird charity, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), is not particularly concerned about the impact of cats on the British mainland. Instead it focuses on what it says is driving UK bird declines: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/climate-change-fundamentally-affecting-european-birds-study-shows\">global warming</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/canaries-in-the-coalmine-loss-of-birds-signals-changing-planet\">intensive agriculture</a> and expanding towns and cities leading to habitat and food loss. “While we know that cats do kill large numbers of birds in UK gardens, there’s no evidence this is affecting decline in the same way that these other issues are,” said a spokesperson.</p> <p>A big reason why they are less worried is the evidence that cats primarily take “the doomed surplus”: weak or injured birds likely to die anyway. In 2008, Baker led a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00836.x\">study</a> in Bristol showing that birds killed by cats on average had less fat and muscle than birds killed by collisions with windows. While there could be other explanations – such as birds having less fat in the morning when cats tend to pounce – Baker says that the fat and muscle scores were so low that the birds were “in dire trouble before they got killed”. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004420050972\">Another study</a> from 2000 found that cat-killed birds in Denmark had smaller spleens, indicative of a weaker immune system.</p> <p>That said, cats do take birds in good shape, and Robbie McDonald says evidence from the US shows that large numbers of cats can have population-level impacts. “But it’s hard to generalise,” he says. Cats might pose a risk to some species some of the time; for others, not at all.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most people who own cats are animal people. They don’t want to have this impact on wildlife</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Tara Pirie, University of Reading</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Charlotte Bartleet-Cross from SongBird Survival argues that it’s about paying attention to birds already under pressure. “A lot of these bird species that are on the [<a href=\"https://www.bto.org/our-science/publications/birds-conservation-concern\">UK birds of conservation concern</a>] list are actually similar to the bird species that are frequently caught by cats,” she says. “This could be having a further impact on numbers.”</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"https://app.bto.org/birdtrends/species.jsp?year=2020&amp;s=grefi\">greenfinch</a>. An outbreak of the parasite-induced disease trichomonosis led to a 65% UK decline in the population in the mid-2000s, which landed it on the conservation red list. As a ground feeder, it’s easy prey for cats. <a href=\"https://app.bto.org/birdtrends/species.jsp?year=2020&amp;s=dunno\">Dunnock</a>, numbers of which have dropped by more than a third since the 1960s due to disappearing food sources, is another ground feeder and frequent cat prey. It is currently on the amber list.</p> <h2>***</h2> <p>Although Baker sees no evidence that cats are responsible for UK bird declines, he agrees that there is a problem worth discussing. “Cats are one of the biggest welfare issues – if not the biggest welfare issue – for wildlife in this country, in terms of the number of individual birds and animals affected, and the length of time many will suffer before they die,” he says. The numbers of animals involved in badger culls and foxes killed for sport “pale into insignificance” in comparison, he says.</p> <p>So should the British adopt the American way and ditch free roaming? It is possibly already happening. Though it is early days, a growing minority are keeping their cats fully indoors. And that worries Daniel Cummings from Cats Protection. “We’re not saying that all cats need to go outside,” he says, but if indoor-only became the norm, some cats “would have significantly reduced welfare”. Backing that up is a <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/9/11/978\">2019 study</a> that suggests many US indoor cats might not get the stimulation they need.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd55ffb392b47f1e34863b3d5baebd7ff215460b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd55ffb392b47f1e34863b3d5baebd7ff215460b/0_0_6685_4408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a handmade sign admonishing cat owners in walldorf, baden-württemberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cat curfew: a handmade sign admonishing cat owners in Walldorf, Baden-Württemberg, where cats are to be kept indoors for three summers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, Cats Protection recommends a dusk-till-dawn cat curfew, along with SongBird Survival and the RSPB which hopes it will be a “win-win”. Cats and birds are most active at dusk and dawn. “It’s a sensible compromise,” says Cummings. “You’re effectively reducing the risk of [the cats] getting in a road traffic collision overnight, and also reducing the risk of predation.” There is some evidence that cats do get hit by cars at night slightly more often than during the day.</p> <p>To further reduce hunting, people can make their gardens <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/gardening-for-wildlife/animal-deterrents/cats-and-garden-birds/bird-friendly-gardens/\">bird-friendly</a> and have their cats wear <a href=\"https://www.birdsbesafe.com/\">a colourful bib</a> (the evidence on bells is less clear). McDonald’s <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31896-0\">research</a> also found that feeding cats a diet with meat-derived protein reduces the amount of prey they bring home, as does playing with them for at least 10 minutes a day. “That’s the sort of thing that anybody can do,” he says. “And it’s really enriching the life of the cat as well.”</p> <p>Pirie, who has spent much of her career studying wild leopards in South Africa, is also conflicted about confining cats permanently. She thinks cat-free buffer zones around conservation areas could be a good idea, but that the most important thing is to listen to people’s concerns and find compromises together. “Most people who own cats are animal people, they don’t want to have this impact on wildlife either.”</p> <p>But from Marra’s perspective, none of it goes far enough. “I don’t think there should be a compromise,” he says. “It’s about people taking responsibility for their animal.” What that means, however, might prove to be a cultural difference.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 14 August 2022.

In a neat twist, the worlds sometimes collide: Marsh nervously eyes his offspring as grenades liable to go off any minute, and after one violent encounter studiously dabs his vest with red paint as if cleaning up a stain in reverse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"babf771ee0ae2ad64b1db405f7e1ed98426987af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/babf771ee0ae2ad64b1db405f7e1ed98426987af/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kinetic … Yippee Ki Yay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kinetic … Yippee Ki Yay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nakatomi Plaza, the opulent LA skyscraper where Gruber’s hostages include McClane’s wife Holly, is represented by a not-even-full box of After Eights and a watering can evokes its grandiose fountain. Marsh picks holes in the plot with a superfan’s affection, gets just enough mileage out of how the tech world of the 80s action heyday has dated, and rightly addresses Holly’s limited characterisation. An effective lighting design conjures gunfire with a surprising level of suspense – and one scene presents a bullet’s point of view.</p> <p>Directed by Hal Chambers and propelled by Marsh’s rhymes, this kinetic afternoon comedy never flags but would probably be better served by a late-night slot. If it’s sometimes a little too neat and tidy in its construct, that’s part of the joke as Marsh’s fastidiousness is contrasted with his partner’s spontaneity. But whether you’re a Die Hard fan or not, it guarantees happy trails.</p> <ul> <li><p>Yippee Ki Yay is at the <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/yippee-ki-yay\">Gilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 29 August</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2022\">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/14/thames-water-ignoring-warnings-surrey-without-water","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T13:30:21Z","webTitle":"Thames Water accused of ignoring warnings after hundreds in Surrey endure days without water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/14/thames-water-ignoring-warnings-surrey-without-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/14/thames-water-ignoring-warnings-surrey-without-water","fields":{"headline":"Thames Water accused of ignoring warnings after hundreds in Surrey endure days without water","trailText":"Lib Dem councillor calls for company to be fined over the incident","byline":"Matthew Weaver","body":"<p>Thames Water has been accused of repeatedly ignoring warnings about cuts to supplies and burst pipes in Surrey where hundreds of households had to endure three days without tap water at the height of this weekend’s heatwave.</p> <p>Residents, including some who were vulnerable, had to queue for bottled water on Saturday in temperatures of well over 30C (86F) after a pump failure at Netley Mill treatment works.</p> <p>By Sunday morning up to 1,000 homes began a third day without water. Supplies were restored to up to 9,000 homes, but many households still complained about low water pressure.</p> <p>Thames Water apologised and confirmed it handed out bottled water to residents in Guildford, Surrey Hills, Dorking and Horsham while engineers worked to restore the supply.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/14/theres-a-nagging-fear-the-village-that-cant-rely-on-running-water\">‘There’s a nagging fear’: the village that can’t rely on running water</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liz Townsend, a Liberal Democrat county councillor for Cranleigh and Ewhurst, called for Thames Water to be fined over the incident and said the company had failed to respond to numerous complaints about previous cuts in supplies.</p> <p>“We’re completely exasperated,” she said. “We had a period last summer when there was just bottled water. We had no water in February during the storm, we had no water in the previous hot period at the beginning of July. And now another hot spell and we have no water.</p> <p>“Our water infrastructure is not resilient enough to cope with all the new housing and the ageing pipes. Whenever they increase the pressure in the system, we get more and more bursts. I’ve been having talks with Thames Water for 10 years, and I’ve been up Westminster several times to raise it, but nobody takes any notice.”</p> <p>Townsend wrote to Sarah Bentley, the chief executive of Thames Water, in July after a previous interruption in supply. The letter, seen by the Guardian, accused the company of taking months, and in some cases years, to repair burst pipes and said it reneged on a public commitment to provide residents with updates on water supplies.</p> <p>Bentley has yet to respond.</p> <p>A statement from Thames Water said: “Netley Mill water treatment works is now back in service and supply is gradually being restored to the local network. This will continue over the remainder of the day. We are very sorry that customers have been impacted especially at a time of high temperatures.</p> <p>“When supplies do begin to return, we are asking customers to try to use this just for essential use initially. This will help us return supplies to everyone quicker. We are supplying bottled water to customers who we know need additional help. If anyone is unable to travel to a bottled water site they should contact us on 0800 316 9800 and we will provide assistance.”</p> <p>Cranleigh is the latest village to run out of water after an official drought was declared in eight areas of England. Dozens of households in Northend, Oxfordshire have been reliant on just bottled water for the last five days.</p> <p>Townsend said: “There was no water on Saturday for [between] 8,000 and 9,000 homes. We have got a trickle this morning. But between 500 and 1,000 households are still without water.”</p> <p>Residents were told that problems extracting water from a borehole meant that two local reservoirs were completely empty and a third was only a quarter full.</p> <p>Townsend said Thames Water’s handling of the crisis had been appalling. She said some vulnerable people on the priority list were not sent bottled water, and farmers had no water for livestock.</p> <p>She added: “There should be financial penalties. If they are not delivering water, people should get refunds. We have thousand and thousands of new houses coming into this area, and yet the basic water infrastructure cannot cope now with the existing number of houses.”</p> <p>Townsend also called for failing water companies to be renationalised.</p> <p>“It is such a precious and reducing resource that perhaps we should be looking at having more of a public ownership model for water,” she said.</p> <p>Three water companies – Welsh Water, Southern Water, and South East Water – have all imposed hosepipe bans, while Yorkshire Water has announced that a ban will start on 26 August, and Thames Water is planning one in the coming weeks.</p> <p>An amber weather warning for extreme heat remained in place on Sunday for large parts of the south, east, west, Midlands and north of England for a fourth day.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/14/what-are-the-fewest-separate-foods-you-could-eat-and-still-have-a-healthy-balanced-diet","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T13:01:09Z","webTitle":"What are the fewest separate foods you could eat and still have a healthy, balanced diet?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/14/what-are-the-fewest-separate-foods-you-could-eat-and-still-have-a-healthy-balanced-diet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/14/what-are-the-fewest-separate-foods-you-could-eat-and-still-have-a-healthy-balanced-diet","fields":{"headline":"What are the fewest separate foods you could eat and still have a healthy, balanced diet?","trailText":"The long-running series in which readers answer other readers’ questions on subjects ranging from trivial flights of fancy to profound scientific and philosophical concepts","byline":"","body":"<p>What are the fewest separate foods you could eat and still have a healthy, balanced diet? <em>Nancy Bamber, Ottawa</em></p> <p><em>Post your answers (and new questions) below or send them to </em><strong><a href=\"mailto:nq@theguardian.com\">nq@theguardian.com</a></strong><em>.

As someone who lives in Edinburgh and works in the arts, it feels traitorous to feel entirely pessimistic at the fringe’s return. The sun is shining, the streets are packed. The Belgian waffle truck in George Square is back! God, I love those waffles, just as I love sitting in the back of Assembly Studio One at two in the afternoon, weeping a little as eight women from different parts of the world sing a traditional Yoruba chant. I’d initially approached <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/she-her\">She/Her</a></strong> (Assembly George Square Studios, <strong>★★★</strong>) with some trepidation; given the current “war on woke”, pronouns have unfortunately become deeply contested territory. I shouldn’t have worried. Created by Nicole Ansari-Cox and produced by her husband, <em>Succession</em> star Brian Cox, the show is a loving, expansive proof of practice in shared vulnerability. Exploring themes of addiction, parenthood, queerness and power, <em>She/Her</em>’s monologues brim with generosity in their form and content: if you cannot speak who you are, sing it. If you feel pinned to the ground, let me unburden you.</p> <p>Solidarity also features in James Ley’s celebratory <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ode-to-joy-how-gordon-got-to-go-to-the-nasty-pig-party\">Ode to Joy (How Gordon </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ode-to-joy-how-gordon-got-to-go-to-the-nasty-pig-party\">Got to </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ode-to-joy-how-gordon-got-to-go-to-the-nasty-pig-party\">Go to the </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ode-to-joy-how-gordon-got-to-go-to-the-nasty-pig-party\">Nasty </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ode-to-joy-how-gordon-got-to-go-to-the-nasty-pig-party\">Pig </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ode-to-joy-how-gordon-got-to-go-to-the-nasty-pig-party\">Party)</a></strong> (Summerhall, <strong>★★★★</strong>): a raucous, cum-stained love letter to friendship, literal arseholes and the European Union. Fearful of being spooned into submission by “Prince Charming types”, strait-laced Scottish government employee Gordon heads to Berlin to attend Berghain’s infamous fetish night Snax, accompanied by his occasional lover Cumpig, and Cumpig’s husband, Manpussy.

In <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/events/exodus\">Exodus</a></strong><strong> </strong>(Traverse, <strong>★★★★</strong>), home secretary Asiya Rao and her senior adviser-slash-handler Phoebe are in Dover for a photo op that will launch Asiya’s new scheme to end Channel crossings – and, hopefully, her campaign for the top job at Westminster. But when a baby washes up onshore, they panic, pop the infant into Asiya’s handbag, and embark on a white-knuckled train ride back to London, complete with fake mothers, gnawed-off nipples and defenestration.</p> <p>A hysterical farce that’s chock-full of deus ex machinas, this National Theatre of Scotland production<em> </em>steers the UK’s current far-right messaging to its natural, nonsensical conclusion and gives it a push over the chalk cliffs. Sophie Steer as Phoebe is particularly commanding; Habiba Saleh as Haben, the asylum seeker turned thespian accomplice, is less convincing, though I suspect this is a consequence of <em>Exodus</em>’s greater preoccupation with the absurdity of political theatre than with the victims of its theatrics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"109d2dd15283a37dec17e9256b8f4fad425b389d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/109d2dd15283a37dec17e9256b8f4fad425b389d/0_0_5084_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aryana Ramkhalawon confronts Habiba Saleh on a train, while Anna Russell-Martin looks on\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aryana Ramkhalawon, left, as Asiya Rao with Anna Russell-Martin (seated) and Habiba Saleh in Exodus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The kind of power that preoccupies <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/move-fast-and-break-things\">Move Fast and Break Things</a></strong> (Summerhall, <strong>★★★</strong>) is similarly destructive, but its operations are less visible. The two-hander centres on a couple who are attempting to create a play about Amit Patel, Google’s shadowy employee No 7, who has been credited with coining the company’s early motto, “don’t be evil”, as well as discovering the patterns in our behavioural data that created the foundations for targeted ads.</p> <p>Dextrous camera work, finger puppetry and shadow play are overlaid with the vibe of a true crime podcast, as Freight theatre constructs a digital underworld that undergirds our experience of reality itself. The two sides of the show don’t always hang together perfectly – the couple’s deteriorating relationship sometimes threatens to draw attention away from the intrigue of their search – but <em>Move Fast</em> is certainly prescient enough to ask questions around knowledge and control in the digital age that we might not yet be prepared to ask, much less fully understand.</p> <p>The first few minutes of Ian McKellen’s highly anticipated new <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/hamlet-with-ian-mckellen\">Hamlet</a></strong><em> </em>(Ashton Hall, <strong>★★</strong>) leave me in a state of different, but equal disorientation. Peter Schaufuss’s production splits the Prince of Denmark in two, with McKellen as his mouthpiece and Johan Christensen embodying his balletic self. The rest of the cast is made up of dancers, who do an excellent job at summing up most of the plot in a few elegant leg-lifts. And indeed, if only one man should ever speak, then of course it ought to be McKellen, who delivers the play’s greatest-hit soliloquies with his usual sonority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2983cf563b166437aa0821b6e00d6b0fbb3adb6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2983cf563b166437aa0821b6e00d6b0fbb3adb6a/0_0_3029_4624/655.jpg\" alt=\"Ian McKellen and Johan Christensen as dual Hamlets.\" width=\"655\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian McKellen and Johan Christensen as dual Hamlets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Devin de Vil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the question that dogs every minute of this condensed retelling is: why? Why is this happening? Having an older Hamlet play opposite a leaping, virile version of himself could have said something interesting about the juxtaposition of youth and age, impetuous aggression and wise cunning – but that never happens. Instead, having two Hamlets on stage together ultimately deprives the tragedy of its central thrust: of how grief isolates and ravages the minds of its victims. Robbing Hamlet of his solitude defangs the story and the resulting production, while very pretty indeed, is left a hollow imitation.</p> <p>Are the kids all right? The prognosis is uncertain in Dipo Baruwa-Etti’s <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/half-empty-glasses\">Half-Empty Glasses</a></strong><strong> </strong>(Roundabout @ Summerhall, <strong>★★</strong>), a Paines Plough production that attempts a similar reckoning with the past. Young Toye is on track to win a prestigious music scholarship when,, unsatisfied by brief mentions of Martin Luther King in history classes, he is emboldened to take his education into his own hands and raise awareness around black historical figures at his school. The issues that Toye and his friends are trying to redress and navigate their way through are very real – they themselves are much less convincing.</p> <p>Rather than telling the story of young people coming into full awareness of the racist systems that will shape their destiny, <em>Half-Empty Glasses</em> feels like an earnest pantomime of activism, packed with awkward half-rhymes, frustrating schoolyard diatribes and shoehorned pedagogical studies. Ultimately, I left the Roundabout tent in Summerhall feeling much more invested in the life and work of Britain’s first black female publisher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/22/margaret-busby-the-uks-first-black-female-publisher-everyone-assumed-i-was-there-to-make-the-tea\">Margaret Busby</a>, than I did in Toye, Ash and Remy; maybe that’s not a bad thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c89550249fbb8a2b4094f79f67aa20a2038e4cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c89550249fbb8a2b4094f79f67aa20a2038e4cb/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ode to Joy (How Gordon Got to Go to the Nasty Pig Party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A big, blurry mess of a show’: Ode to Joy (How Gordon Got to Go to the Nasty Pig Party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you’ve ever loved and wanted the best for an elderly person, you would want them to be taken care of by Bilal Zafar, even if it meant them becoming material for his standup comedy. Soon after obtaining his degree, Bilal embarked on a short career as a carer in a private care home. His new show, <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bilal-zafar-care\">Care</a></strong> (Underbelly. <strong>★★★</strong>), makes gentle fun of its elderly residents, highlighting their eccentricities, their pettiness, their feuds over giant Scrabble. He brilliantly conjures the difficult job of caring for others, particularly in their twilight years, the patience and compassion it requires to bring comfort and dignity to others and the exploitative conditions many care workers currently face.</p> <p>Another strong standup show asks: what do you do when an intruder tries to break into your home? You stuff an oven-ready lasagne into your bag and get the hell outta Dodge, that’s what. But American standup – and fringe debutante – <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/atsuko-okatsuka-the-intruder\">Atsuko Okatsuka</a></strong> (Pleasance Courtyard, <strong>★★★★</strong>) isn’t going to give up without a fight and, in an expertly woven hour, explains how life has endowed her with a very particular set of skills for fending off home invaders. By balancing her present danger with musings on whether mental health conditions should be renamed after theme park rides, Atsuko manages the tricky push-pull of comedic tension with thrilling ease. Despite her insistence that she’s not cut out for real life, she’s immediately someone you want in your corner. Just don’t ask her whether she skates.</p> <p>I’ll just hold up my hands now and say this: I didn’t know who Sheeps were and therefore fully expected much of their retrospective show <strong><a href=\"https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/sheeps-ten-years-ten-laughs#overview\">Sheeps: </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/sheeps-ten-years-ten-laughs#overview\">10 Years, </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/sheeps-ten-years-ten-laughs#overview\">10 Laughs</a></strong> (Pleasance Courtyard, <strong>★★★</strong>) (it’s actually been 12 years) to go over my head. What I got instead was an entirely affable hour of watching three pals larking about on stage, still clearly at the top of their game and with plenty more meta-nonsense to spout. And yet earnestness cannot help but shine through in their final sketch, Three Cowboys on the Range, which serves as a touching ode to the trio’s unique alchemy and the enduring quality of their friendship.

The plot, if there is one, revolves around a social media manager who lies down on the floor of his office lobby one morning, creating a stir across a city that nonetheless plunges relentlessly towards higher productivity and conversion rates. The rest of the action is created by us, the audience, with a script projected on to a screen. In a global economy that feels increasingly atomised and exploitative, which seems to place value in all the wrong places and pockets, what do we do? How should we spend our days?</p> <p>Who can say – at the very least, <em>Work.txt</em> has some ideas on how we might spend an hour together. As we sing My Heart Will Go On in unison and the printer on the floor gains sudden sentience, I suddenly think: God, but I do love this. As we stack up our yellow blocks just to see them get knocked down again, I think: yes, we can build them back better! Things can always be made better if they’re meaningful and worthy of our labour and our attention.

We had been together for almost 57 years and, despite having busy, demanding jobs, during our marriage, as well as bringing up a family, we had never doubted that we were soulmates.<br><br>There was never anyone else for either of us. We thought alike, enjoyed the same things, anticipated what the other person was thinking … almost to the extent of telepathy. Our love was deep and enduring. Without him, I am a rudderless ship.<br><br>Friends and family tell me I am strong and that I am coping well, but they don’t understand the emptiness I feel inside. It is not loneliness (I have lots of friends to fill my days with), but a sense of having lost a huge part of myself. My soul. He was my reason for living. My soulmate. <strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <p>Yes – but don’t wait too long for yours to arrive.</p> <p>I feel I have to agree that soulmates exist, having met mine at the age of 18 and being head-over-heels in love with her still today, 42 years later. They say marriage is hard work, and that if you don’t put in that hard work you can grow apart and the relationship dies. I believe that, too, but not based on my own experience, more on that of friends and colleagues I have talked to over the years. Life with my soulmate has generally been so easy and natural that it has required no work at all. </p> <p>A friend once said I love my wife like I breathe – that it is so natural and automatic that I don’t know I am doing this. She also said that is a little dangerous. This proved to be true and for a while (after 10 years together) I started to take our love for granted, which caused us to have a break while we re-evaluated. But it was obvious we were meant to be together, so we got back together, kept an eye on the power balance and have been happy together ever since. We just love spending time together and, now that we are retired, we can do that every day. So, I do think of my wife as my soulmate and cannot believe I would have been as happy with anyone else.</p> <p>And yet a number of random coincidences brought us together. If they had not happened in the way they did, we would never have met. I have been blessed with a number of close female friends over the years, who have had a series of unsuccessful relationships on their way to finding Mr Right – and have never found him. </p> <p>I think it was always hard and against the odds to find that perfect partner. In the modern world, especially if you don’t meet “the One” early in life and end up in the dating game, it is even harder. So, it is much healthier to admit that, chances are, your soulmate is out there, but you will never meet. It is better to accept that your prime relationship is unlikely to provide everything you need and to build up your independence so that your prime relationship with your non-soulmate doesn’t have to be perfect to succeed.</p> <p>But a few of you will be as lucky as me – just be careful you don’t start taking it for granted. <strong>Steve Richards</strong></p> <p>I think I have several soulmates – all of the wonderful people in my life with whom I connect on an emotional and spiritual level. </p> <p>A soulmate is not just defined by romantic love, but by whatever connection or intimacy your soul craves from another; when you can both laugh and cry together, support and challenge each other, spend time apart but continue to come together again. How gorgeous to be able to experience such comfort and joy in life – not just with a partner, but with friends and family and even pets. </p> <p>I’m lucky enough to have more soulmates than I can count on one hand. <strong>Aine Ruth</strong></p> <p>I believe both in soulmates and twin flames. </p> <p>A soulmate is someone who is unconditionally in your life for as long as you are both alive and well. You may argue or disagree at times, but you’re deeply bound together across anything life throws at you. You have a deep connection and secure friendship. And you can have that in a best friendship or a family member or in a partnership with your lover.</p> <p>But there are also twin flames, which is what my partner and I are. It’s different from soulmates – and you go through different hardships even before you can be together. </p> <p>My best friend; she is my soulmate. We will be each other’s always, for ever. My partner is my twin flame and we will always be that, because no matter how far apart we are or try to be, we are always drawn together. <strong>Jocelyn Hofstede</strong></p> <p>I prefer “kindred spirits”, à la <a href=\"https://www.anneofgreengables.com/blog/10-life-lessons-weve-all-learned-from-anne-shirley\">Anne of Green Gables</a>. A kindred spirit may be a friend, a child, a partner. When we’ve met one, it’s rare and to be treasured. For mates, I think, for most of us, there are hundreds of people we could be quite happy with, attracted to and love. Some of these are just closer to the heart and our essence, really getting us and us getting them. <strong>quiettess</strong></p> <p>I was watching a reality TV show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/01/i-watched-two-series-of-below-deck-in-two-days-why-cant-i-finish-the-wire\">Below Deck</a>, and one of the girls said that the guy she was dating was her soulmate. Someone else pointed out they had only been dating for five weeks and she said: ‘Yeah, he’s my soulmate for now.’ <strong>MariefromON</strong></p> <p>No – and the concept is a dangerous one, giving rise to unrealistic expectations. <strong>Rafiq Mahmood</strong></p> <p>I don’t know a single person who claims to have found theirs – and I know lots of very happily married people. Partners can share views, aspirations, preferences, but whether couples really can be joined as two parts of a compass, <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44131/a-valediction-forbidding-mourning\">as in Donne’s poem</a>, is unlikely outside romantic verse and Hollywood films. <strong>boutondor</strong></p> <p>Not in the traditional sense. It is extremely beguiling to imagine that the one with whom we have found happiness was destined all along to be our companion, but this is not the case. In fact, you would have been satisfied, in one way or another, with all manner of potential partners. My own husband is fantastic, but I can’t pretend he was the only one for me. If, after three dates, he or I had died in a fiery disaster, the other would have moved on, wondered what would have been and then found someone else. The resulting marriage would have been just as happy, but very different – infuriating in other ways.</p> <p>Perhaps my husband is my soulmate in a different sense. We were not matched by the stars, merely by circumstance, but we have grown together so that now we fit better than we would with any other. Anyone else now, after nearly 20 years, would be awkward and impossible – not getting the jokes, wanting to sleep on my side of the bed.</p> <p>Are my worn slippers soulmates for my feet? They don’t fit anyone else as well as they fit me. <strong>GarethEdwards666</strong></p> <p>Lovely and true-feeling answer. Soulmates are made, not found. (PS Your slippers?

The canopy of trees we have – you can’t buy that.”</p> <p>The community is busy renovating and <a href=\"https://iskconnews.org/northern-irelands-krishna-island-temple-to-undergo-major-renovations/\">upgrading facilities </a>to turn the island into a retreat for visitors from Ireland, Britain, India, the US and elsewhere.

We probably should have built up our presence in other locations first,” said Manu, 63, a soft-spoken Dubliner.</p> <p>In the 1980s, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a branch of Hinduism known for chanting and vegetarianism, was growing in Belfast and Dublin, boosted by support from high-profile adherents such as former Beatle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/dec/07/artsfeatures.thebeatles\">George Harrison</a>.</p> <p>The symbolism of a headquarters between the capitals of Northern Ireland and Ireland appealed. So did the price, the inclusion of a large Victorian house – an earl’s former hunting lodge – and the opportunity to escape hostile scrutiny. “The Catholic church was a bit on top of us for supposedly taking their sons and daughters,” said Manu.</p> <p>Plus, there was the confidence of youth. “We were in our 20s. It was very exciting. Not everyone buys an island.”</p> <p>Controversy followed in 1987 in the form of a fabricated and eventually discredited <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/the-strange-tale-of-the-man-who-claimed-hed-been-fed-drugged-ice-cream-and-held-hostage-by-hare-krishna-in-fermanagh-36114293.html\">story about brainwashing</a>, drugged ice-cream and kidnapping.</p> <p>The group’s reputation recovered but the winters were harsh, the little barge connecting the island to the mainland often broke down and it was difficult to sustain jobs and families. By 2002 the permanent population dwindled to about 12 people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e3188be80d8ba9e1c5d6e7a905dd9e24b17ba09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e3188be80d8ba9e1c5d6e7a905dd9e24b17ba09/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A monk in the temple room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monk Advaita Purusha in the temple room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A German pop star, among others, expressed interest in buying the island but the Hare Krishnas ended up keeping it. Volunteers raised funds to cover running costs, currently about £60,000 a year, and others visited to help maintain the property, meditate and pray. Manu, who runs a gallery in Dublin, visits weekly.</p> <p>The growing Indian community – now estimated at 45,000 in Ireland and 15,000 in Northern Ireland – drove a turnaround. Having come to work in healthcare, IT, engineering and other sectors, they were astonished to discover an island dedicated to a branch of Hinduism, said Manu. “When they see Paddys here in the temple worshipping, they can’t believe it.”</p> <p>Coachloads visit during festivals and open days, their number swelled by tourists and officials from Fermanagh district council, which provides financial support.

Their mother works long hours as an NHS neonatal nurse. Their father, a car mechanic, nurtures Sol but is violent towards his wife and daughter. Eight-year-old Stella observes: “When my dad gets angry, it is like lightning and thunder and hailstones.” He beats Stella for being “in-sol-ent” and she cannot understand why her mother and Sol fail to intervene. To compound matters, Stella has Addison’s disease, which affects her mood and energy. School and friends are Stella’s salvation until her parents’ divorce.</p> <p>Amuah, a British Ghanaian barrister specialising in white-collar crime, has created an intelligent, likable narrator whom we quickly root for. Stella enrols at Bristol University: “The only black girl in a hall of two hundred people.” Here, she is ostracised when she reports the behaviour of a drunken white student who exposes himself. She decides to study law, but just as her career begins to soar her personal life implodes.</p> <p>Stella’s boyfriend, Christian, seems perfect until he loses his temper. Amuah explores the blight of domestic abuse – how trauma is often intergenerational and the damage long-lasting. She also examines the effects of violence on its bystanders, too paralysed to help. Stella’s pain reveals itself in unexpected ways. She becomes increasingly superstitious, convinced her happiness depends on the daily appearance of two magpies.</p> <p>There is occasionally too much explanation in the first-person narration. Amuah clearly wants to reflect Stella’s naivety when describing her childhood, but it sometimes slows the narrative. However, her interrogation of trauma is powerful and this is neatly balanced with joyful accounts of the friends’ get-togethers. Like her protagonist, Amuah takes time to find her feet and the novel’s final 100 pages are the strongest.

Some of those who attended, and who will decide the identity of the new prime minister, suggested they had come along out of duty, to choose the least worst option on offer.</p> <p>“Neither of the above,” said an elderly gentleman who preferred not to give his name. “I’m afraid we just don’t get the quality of people coming into politics these days,” was his glum assessment before proceedings began.</p> <p>If the many party members interviewed by the <em>Observer</em> had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/12/liz-truss-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-frontrunner-workaholic\" title=\"\">any pre-hustings preferences</a>, they were tentative and seemed open to change. People were there because they wanted to know and hear more, not to have their prejudices confirmed.</p> <p>Lucy Coxall, a project manager for a London design company, who had travelled from Wiltshire, said she was genuinely undecided and irritated at media reports that Truss had it in the bag already. “It is ridiculous to suggest it is already over. I really want to hear what the candidates have to say,” she said.</p> <p>Caroline Baldwin, who runs a property business with her husband, said she was leaning to Truss but not firmly, while Jude Walker, who used to vote Labour, but had switched to the Tories a few years ago because she liked Boris Johnson, seemed to wish the dethroned PM could carry on, as she arrived to assess the qualities of his potential successors.</p> <p>Ned Bowron, who runs an outside events business and is deputy chair of membership and fundraising for Stroud Conservatives, said he too was leaning in the Truss direction but was open to persuasion by Sunak, while Bob Griffin, who runs an export business, preferred Truss on the evidence thus far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb029de52cc6037c7fb731b782aa93562e19a908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb029de52cc6037c7fb731b782aa93562e19a908/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tory supporters remain unconvinced by Rishi Sunak, pictured at the Cheltenham hustings on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory supporters remain unconvinced by Rishi Sunak, pictured at the Cheltenham hustings on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two hours of speeches and interrogation later, many views had changed. Some undecideds had made up their minds, some decideds had switched allegiances, while others had just hardened their opinions in the direction they were already leaning. Strikingly, the movement was by no means all – or even predominantly – towards the hot favourite Truss.</p> <p>The previously agnostic Coxall had decided to plump decisively for Sunak on the basis of what she had seen and heard. “I was much more convinced by Rishi and thought he had an answer for everything on the economy,” she said afterwards. “He presented himself with energy. He sounded so much more progressive and had so much more of a vision for the future. Everything from Liz was short-term thinking.” If Truss were to become prime minister, Coxall believes the Tories will have less chance of victory at the next general election.</p> <p>Griffin, on the other hand, had become more convinced that Truss was the right choice after the meeting: “What she was trying to sell me was a genuine ‘to do list’ while what he was selling was ‘Rishi Sunak for prime minister’.”</p> <p>Both Bowron and Baldwin, however, had gone from preferring Truss to thinking better of Sunak than they had before. “Liz’s financial plans seemed, well, rather unbudgeted and rather worrying,” said Bowron. “I am pretty sure I will vote for Rishi now. I think he is a safer pair of hands. Liz doesn’t seem to understand that those who most need help don’t pay tax and yet she is going on about tax cuts.” Baldwin was also concerned that Truss’s tax plans would not help the most needy. “I was leaning to her but now I am not sure,” she said. </p> <p>This weekend, with less than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/13/tory-leadership-buckland-first-in-cabinet-to-flip-support-from-sunak-to-truss\" title=\"\">three weeks to go before voting ends</a>, Truss is way ahead of Sunak, according to opinion polls of the Tory membership.</p> <p>Today’s survey of 570 Conservative members, by Opinium, for the <em>Observer</em>, gives Truss a 22-point lead. She is on 61% to Sunak’s 39%. About 47% say they know who they will vote for, although it did not feel that way on Thursday night. This may be because those who choose to attend official hustings are by definition people who are still open to persuasion. Both Bowron and Coxall said after the hustings they were convinced that the eventual result would be much closer than the pundits were predicting, or than the polls were currently showing.</p> <p>Where this latest poll is perhaps most intriguing is in the lack of enthusiasm it shows for either Truss or Sunak among those who must choose the next leader of the party and country after September 5. This is evident when those with a vote in the contest are offered the choice of either Truss or Sunak, against the theoretical option of Johnson remaining leader and prime minister. Asked who they would prefer in No 10 – Johnson or Truss – 63% of Conservative members said they would prefer to keep Johnson while only 22% would rather have Truss. When the offer is Johnson staying on, versus Sunak taking over, 68% say Johnson and just 19% Sunak. Chris Curtis of Opinium says sellers’ remorse is setting in as far as Johnson is concerned. “It could be down to people forgetting how bad things got, or a lack of appetite for the replacements,” he said.</p> <p>But it is hardly encouraging for the eventual winner to know that three times as many of their party’s own voters would now prefer to have the previous leader than either of them to fight for a fifth consecutive Tory win at the next general election. Inside the hustings at Cheltenham, there were cheers for Truss and Sunak in equal measure. But there was deep uncertainty – and plenty who were unimpressed. In the top tier, two men sat observing wryly. They said they were both remainers and did not warm to either candidate. One of them told the <em>Observer</em>: “I don’t even vote Conservative any more. I just haven’t given up my membership. I couldn’t vote for either of them.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/14/medea-review-adura-onashile-liz-lochhead-the-hub-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T12:56:56Z","webTitle":"Medea review – Adura Onashile exudes awesome authority in bloody tragedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/medea-review-adura-onashile-liz-lochhead-the-hub-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/14/medea-review-adura-onashile-liz-lochhead-the-hub-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Medea review – Adura Onashile exudes awesome authority in bloody tragedy","trailText":"Liz Lochhead’s Scots verse spits wit and venom as male power meets female determination with operatic intensity, in this National Theatre of Scotland staging","byline":"Mark Fisher","body":"<p>Everybody is larger than life in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/18/michael-boyd-theatre-director-portrait\">Michael Boyd</a>’s tremendous staging of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/16/liz-lochhead-interview-you-re-stuck-writing-something-until-you-go-to-hell-with-it\">Liz Lochhead</a>’s play, still queasily contentious 2,500 years after the Euripides original. In one sense, this is literally the case. Tom Piper’s set is a catwalk that overshadows the audience as we stand like a mob gathered to witness an execution.

The Queen Elizabeth in King’s Lynn, near me – bits of the hospital are being held up by stilts. That is not good enough for patients across the NHS,” she said.</p> <p>Caroline Shaw, the hospital’s chief executive, told the Sunday Times last month that “the roof is like a chocolate Aero bar. There are bubbles in the concrete and we’re checking it daily to make sure those bubbles don’t break, and the roof doesn’t come down. It really is like a ticking timebomb.”</p> <p>She added: “For patients who are lying in bed and seeing these props, it does feel quite unsafe.” The hospital had to evacuate patients from its intensive care unit last year and move some to hospitals 40 miles away amid fear that the roof might collapse.</p> <p>But Davey pointed out that Truss had been a member of recent governments that had resisted pleas from NHS leaders for a major increase in the service’s capital budget to enable an overhaul of its ageing, sometimes dangerously inadequate estate.</p> <p>“It is outrageous that Liz Truss is openly referencing that her local constituency hospital has been fitted with these roofs, despite sitting in cabinet and being a senior member of successive Conservative governments. This government’s failed NHS record of record waiting times and crumbling hospitals is also her record of failure,” he said.</p> <p>Last year a whistleblower at West Suffolk hospital, which also has RAAC planks, revealed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-57941926\">to the BBC</a> that it had commissioned a law firm to assess its risk of facing charges of corporate manslaughter if a sudden roof collapse proved fatal.</p> <p>Hinchingbrooke last year banned patients weighing more than 19 stone from having surgery in two of its operating theatres in case it put too much strain on the floor.</p> <p>Pippa Heylings, a Lib Dem councillor in Cambridgeshire, said: “We want to see a health minister at our local hospital this week to see for themselves and finally take urgent action.”</p> <p>In her reply, Caulfield told Cooper that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had set aside £110m “to mitigate the immediate risk” and that trusts would receive £575m more to help. However, several of the affected trusts say it would be cheaper to build a new hospital than rebuild one riddled with RAAC.</p> <p>A DHSC spokesperson said: “We are taking action to improve health infrastructure across the country and have provided more than £4bn for trusts to support local priorities – including to maintain and refurbish their premises – and have set aside over £685m to directly address issues relating to the use of RAAC in the NHS estate.</p> <p>“By 2030 we will have 40 new hospitals which will provide state-of-the-art facilities to ensure world-class provision of healthcare for NHS patients and staff by replacing outdated infrastructure.”</p> <p>The National Audit Office has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/02/boris-johnson-faces-investigation-into-claims-over-40-new-hospitals\">launched a ‘value for money’ inquiry</a> into Boris Johnson’s manifesto pledge to build 40 new hospitals by 2030, including “whether all projects truly meet the classification of ‘new hospitals’”.</p> <p>• This article was updated on 15 August 2022 to include information about the NAO inquiry.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-threat-life-courage-fatwa","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T12:39:00Z","webTitle":"I could not believe how bravely Salman Rushdie faced the threats to his life.

That he was talking at all at such an event – with no personal security, no special precautions – will have been a shock to many, given that he will always be best known, to his chagrin, not for something he did, but for something that was done to him, when the Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against him in 1989.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-defied-those-who-would-silence-him-too-many-fear-causing-offence\">Where Salman Rushdie defied those who would silence him, today too many fear causing offence | Kenan Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But even then, when the threats against him seemed to be at the most heated, he refused to be cowed, always looking straight ahead when he walked slowly from his hiding places to his security detail’s car, never bowing his head, never scuttling. If you succumb to the fear, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/18/joseph-anton-salman-rushdie-review\">he writes in Joseph Anton</a>, his memoir of that period, “you will be its creature for ever, its prisoner”.</p> <p>“One thing I feel, well, proud of, let’s say, is if you knew nothing about my life, if all you had were my books, I don’t think you would feel that something traumatic happened to me in 1989. I thought: be the writer that you want to be,” he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/15/salman-rushdie-i-am-stupidly-optimistic-it-got-me-through-those-bad-years\">when I interviewed him last year</a>.</p> <p>Yet I persisted in asking, to his irritation, questions about how the death threat had affected him. Because I couldn’t see how it had: in person, he is warm, interested in everything and always one of the most fun people at a party. Only last week I sent him an email, and he wrote back at once, always happy to talk about anything (as long as it’s not the fatwa). He hates how the fatwa shaped perceptions of him as much as he resented how it shrank his life when he lived for a decade in hiding. “It destroys my individuality as a person and as a writer. I’m not a geopolitical entity. I’m someone writing in a room,” he said to me. And so, with great determination and courage, he retained his individuality by choosing freedom, with all the risks that entailed.</p> <p>So the fact that Rushdie was speaking at a book event when he was attacked is entirely in keeping with the man. Even more characteristic was what he was speaking about: the rights of writers who face persecution. People who have endured far less than him have found themselves lured by the siren song of reactionary conservatism; Rushdie’s great friend Christopher Hitchens was not immune to it, and all that happened to him was he aged.</p> <p>But Rushdie’s moral compass has never wavered, and he remains a fearless defender of the freedom of expression. In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/salman-rushdie-pen-charlie-hebdo-peter-carey\">he was scathing</a> about the authors who objected to PEN America honouring the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, months after the murderous attacks on its staff by Islamic extremists. Peter Carey condemned PEN’s “seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its obligation to a large and disempowered segment of the population”. Rushdie, an atheist who was raised Muslim, retorted: “What I would say to both Peter and Michael [Ondaatje] and the others is, I hope nobody ever comes after them.”</p> <p>Ignorant people have been trying to school Rushdie from the moment the extremists began to come after him. Looking back on news coverage from 1989, it’s striking how little sympathy there was for Rushdie then, on the left or the right. There was a general sense that he had brought this on himself because he had offended extremists. It would be extremely wrong to believe we live in more enlightened times now. Three years ago, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/satanic-verses-salman-rushdie-review-fatwa-muslim-iran-heresy-a8799771.html\">a columnist in the Independent</a>, who had not read The Satanic Verses, wrote, “Rushdie’s silly, childish book should be banned under today’s anti-hate legislation.” Two years ago, Rushdie, along with JK Rowling – herself <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2022/08/13/jk-rowling-involves-police-for-death-threats-in-wake-of-salman-rushdie-stabbing-17178824/\">no stranger to death threats</a> – was mocked for signing what is known as <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\">the Harper’s letter</a>, which argued against censorship on the left, as well as the right.</p> <p>“There’s a youthful progressive movement, much of which is extremely valuable, but there does seem to be within it an acceptance that certain ideas should be suppressed, and I just think that’s worrying,” he said to me. He has been thinking about these issues for longer than some of his critics have been alive. In 2005, he gave a speech, <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/article_2331jsp/\">Defend the Right to Be Offended</a>, in which he said, “It seems to me to be a liberal failure to say that even though we don’t understand what is upsetting those who say they are offended, we shouldn’t upset them … People have the fundamental right to take an argument where somebody is offended by what they say.” This is not a very fashionable argument now, when Rowling’s name is now considered analogous to Voldemort in progressive circles, and comedians such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/celebrities-react-will-smith-hitting-chris-rock-the-oscars\">Chris Rock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/04/dave-chappelle-attacked-by-man-with-replica-gun-at-la-comedy-festival\">Dave Chappelle</a> are physically attacked on stage because someone was offended by something they have said.</p> <p>Rushdie has always stood against all this, and he stands for much more. It is completely devastating that he has been attacked. The rest of us should think how lucky we are that we only need to look to him to see what true courage looks like. And he should take enormous pride in knowing that he really is both the writer and the man that he wanted to be.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hadley Freeman is a Guardian columnist and features writer</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Walking through his parkland at Compton Verney, a Robert Adam house in Warwickshire – now an art gallery – the lake is indolently still as if it knew better than to stir in the summer heat, and it’s tempting to imagine how gratified its creator would be by <strong><a href=\"https://www.comptonverney.org.uk/event/luke-jerram-crossings/\">Crossings</a></strong> and the beautiful way in which multidisciplinary artist Luke Jerram, in collaboration with Radio 4 producer Julian May, has identified new capability within the landscape.</p> <p>Nine rowing boats, freshly painted, wait by the water’s edge. There is a list of 10 stories – a multifarious anthology, mostly about journeying by boat on water – on a board on the bank. Each story is given a couple of sentences – you have to choose just one. You then take out a boat with your story (the boats are equipped with speakers and can accommodate four people at most). Each story lasts 20 minutes and the outing takes half an hour. Row, row, row your boat gently across the … I listen to the testimony of gallant Iranian Mana Azarish, who, aged 13, when her father’s courage failed him, guided a boat of refugees across the Channel. She was as lost as she was brave: “How do I know the boat is going the right direction?” she asked. She was told to follow a star – a biblical instruction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Crossings revives the miracle of being alive at all – of staying afloat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I love the sound of her voice, its light and warmth. She sounds untraumatised. But what are you to feel about her terrifying ordeal as you idly pull on the oars? I am accompanied by a cluster of dragonflies and try carefully to avoid a swan preening itself with standoffish – swim-offish – grace. Across the lawn is the becalmed house with its magnificently restored Adam facade and stone the colour of milky tea. There are oaks and cedars and hopeful new plantings. On a bridge spanning the lake, four sphinxes keep watch. The tranquillity is profound. How does this English idyll connect with remembered hell? What does it make you feel? A lazy schadenfreude? An I’m-all-right-Jack complacency? Or, more wholesomely, an enhanced gratitude for an English summer’s day? I step out of the boat undecided yet delighted by the rarity of reverie, the way the peace of the lake allows for the driftwood of thought. Half an hour feels tantalisingly short.</p> <p>I’m curious about the other stories on offer, and it turns out to be possible to listen to an edited selection at an audio post (good tip for landlubbers). But it’s only once I’ve sampled the stories in full (this can be done at Compton Verney’s welcome centre) that I understand the meticulous variety and scope of the project. It makes you think that each of our stories is a vessel of sorts. I am especially moved by Currach, a lyrical account by three women of building a boat on the west coast of Ireland, in memory of a sister and friend – an act of faith and continuing life. Fishing With Cormorants is fascinating, too – at once admirable and sinister – an account of how these wild birds are used to fish in Japan; the ancient tradition of <em>ukai</em>. I relished the obsessive quality of Richard King’s cormorant knowledge and the accompanying recitation, by Togo Igawa, of austere haikus about cormorant fishing – Japanese nocturnes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edc0d27c4aedfd6f15a761feaf7c991554897d38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edc0d27c4aedfd6f15a761feaf7c991554897d38/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Jerram at Compton Verney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Jerram at Compton Verney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Quezada-Neiman/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But standing out from the crowd for sheer charm is Mr Fan (I am now a fan), a retired barber from Greenwich who once cut the hair of Julian May and his sons. One of the Vietnamese boat people, he set off in 1975 with his family in a boat none of them knew how to sail. Their journey to Hong Kong should have taken a week but lasted three months. As they sighted the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, a typhoon blew them back, as in a nightmare, to Vietnam. Mr Fan punctuates his desperate story with bursts of cheery laughter. He expresses gratitude towards England. Against the odds, his favourite word would seem to be “lucky”.</p> <p><em>Crossings</em> makes you register keenly the difference between stepping into a boat on a whim and out of direst need. There is another important difference, too, between a necessary journey and a self-sought endurance test. Seb Coulthard, out of heroism or insane folly (you decide), underwent a freezing, 800-mile journey, in competition with the elements, to sample what Ernest Shackleton endured sailing from Antarctica to South Georgia to rescue stranded colleagues.</p> <p>There is, I confess, a satisfaction to listening to these shattering, drenching, epic voyages within dry, safe, self-contained 20-minute slots. But what also intrigues, once Coulthard’s punishing report of his experience is done, is his account of returning home. He is staggered by the choices in the supermarket – the bewildering excess. Why so many versions of cornflakes? And if there is a shared message in these narratives, it is to have a rethink about what one needs. <em>Crossings</em> revives the miracle of being alive at all – of staying afloat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f7bf672da055c5d46dd3d1f0738a72645f7b1f6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7bf672da055c5d46dd3d1f0738a72645f7b1f6d/0_0_8085_5396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Batchelor’s Candela (2002).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Strange fruit on vines of cable’: David Batchelor’s Candela (2002) at Compton Verney. <br>Photograph by Jamie Woodley © Compton Verney</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist © Compton Verney, Photo by Jamie Woodley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is an obvious connection between Luke Jerram’s vision and that of <strong><a href=\"https://www.comptonverney.org.uk/event/david-batchelor-colour-is/\">Colour Is</a></strong>, a show by the Scottish artist <a href=\"https://www.davidbatchelor.co.uk/\">David Batchelor</a>, inside the house at Compton Verney. Jo Royle is the link: she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/26/plastiki-recycled-boat-arrives-sydney\">skippered the Plastiki</a>, a boat constructed from 12,500 recycled two-litre plastic bottles, from San Francisco to Sydney to draw attention to plastic in the oceans. Hanging within Compton Verney’s grand entrance hall, instead of the expected chandelier, is <em>Candela</em> (2002) – a bunch of lights inside plastic bleach bottles like strange fruit on vines of cable: bright green, blue and chilli-pepper red. This is a show of colourful repurposing and the first large-scale survey of Batchelor’s work: 40 years of painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, animation and tapestry. It is a unified adventure in which anything might turn out to be ornamental and playfully recycled – especially objects that never asked to be seen.</p> <p>The most appealing – because beautiful – exhibit is <em>Concreto</em> (one of several related pieces): three shelves – like tiered mantelpieces. These display miscellaneously festive objects: paint lids, a bottle-brush, Mexican beads – a party to meet and greet the eye. The piece was inspired by walls topped with shards of turquoise glass seen in Sicily. The concrete works as a base for colours of Matisse-like gaiety. Batchelor’s quest to make something out of (almost) nothing is a delight.

The movement was brutally suppressed through the use of widespread detention camps and systemic violence.</p> <p>Though successive British governments have attempted to distance themselves from the violence that unfolded, the documentary, which airs on Channel 4 on Sunday at 10pm, shows how Britain was not only involved in a regime of systematic torture – including allegations of murder, rape and forced castration – but took steps to suppress evidence.</p> <p>The documentary, titled A Very British Way of Torture, pieces together many of the worst abuses committed by British colonial forces through survivor testimony and expert analysis from a team of British and Kenyan historians.

And I think documents like this really illustrate that, no, people at the time knew this was wrong as well. It was a specific effort by people in the government and people in the colonial state to conspire to keep that out of the public record. That finding of the documentary is very significant,” he added.</p> <p>The documentary also uncovers fresh details about the governor’s complaints committee, a shadowy body in the Kenyan administration that the film shows was one of the chief mechanisms for suppressing allegations of torture.</p> <p>Boender describes the documentary as “striking” in exposing the violence that occurred under the British empire. He believes there is a disconnect between the research and conversations that occur between historians about the empire and the current public debate.</p> <p>“You find that the debate is sort of stuck, what in my opinion is 50 years in the past. In the public level, the debate is ‘was empire good?’, whereas we’re kind of debating well, how bad was it and in what ways was it bad.

So what drives him on? By Stuart McGurk","byline":"Stuart McGurk","body":"<p>Like most of us, the current turmoil in British politics has seen Johnny Flynn – actor, folk musician, the kind of multi-hyphenate who plays the hurdy-gurdy – spend the past few weeks doom-scrolling and current-affairs-obsessing. Flynn is a multitasker. He is obsessed with news anchors and reporters and follows many of them on Twitter, noting, with alarm, how they think social media is the most important thing in the world. He now wakes up each morning with such genuinely worrying thoughts as: I wonder what Jacob Rees-Mogg said about Liz Truss last night. He likens the fearful voices drowned out by the media circus to a character in a Greek tragedy. Cassandra, he reckons, was destined to tell the truth but be ignored (Flynn is not against a classical reference). He finds it all horrible and depressing and dispiriting. He loves it.</p> <p>For while it’s purgatory for the rest of us, for Flynn, it’s also research. He’s currently in Belfast, midway through shooting a new series called <em>The Lovers</em>, where he’s playing a self-obsessed political journalist – a “slightly younger Robert Peston or Andrew Marr”, he says, “one who is in with the millennials, or at least thinks he is”.</p> <p>Flynn is a rare creature: not a musician-<em>turned</em>-actor, which is common; not an actor-<em>turned</em>-musician, rarer but hardly a unicorn; but someone who has had two fully formed careers from the get-go. He has, therefore, been able to choose how they intertwine. There’s his work on screen: <em>Lovesick</em>, <em>Emma</em>, <em>Stardust</em>, <em>The</em> <em>Dig</em>, <em>Genius</em>; he’s released five studio albums and counting – the latest, <em>Lost in the Cedar Wood</em>, made in collaboration with a nature writer in lockdown. There’s theatre – <em>Jerusalem</em>, <em>Twelfth Night</em> – and he has composed everything from <em>The Detectorists’</em> theme tune to the Globe’s production of <em>As You Like It</em>, for which he used only period instruments. (He is quite possibly the only person alive to have written music for the nyckelharpa, the hurdy-gurdy and the hardingfele, a kind of Norwegian fiddle.) Flynn is pretty sure he has ADD.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"00440cfee27de229abc93002942b18b63bc01051\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00440cfee27de229abc93002942b18b63bc01051/142_0_2940_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Double trouble: Johnny Flynn (right) in The Score, a musical heist featuring his songs and co-starring Will Poulter (left).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Double trouble: Johnny Flynn (right) in The Score, a musical heist featuring his songs and co-starring Will Poulter (left).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LMK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Zoom, his shy, distracted manner – hair wrestled this way and that, eye contact only ever fleeting – suggests someone forever worrying about what else he could be doing. Which is perhaps why, for his latest project, he’s decided to do several things at once. <em>The Score</em>, set to be released this September, is both a crime thriller and a musical that uses Flynn’s own songs to punctuate it. Starring Flynn and Will Poulter as a mismatched criminal duo, this modern musical seems a natural fit for Flynn.</p> <p>Yet he hasn’t watched one on stage for years. “These days,” he says, “I feel constantly failed by them. I stopped paying to see musicals in the days of the band biopic musical, because I found them really awful.”</p> <p>Flynn himself has form in this area. For a time, he was cast as the drummer Roger Taylor in the much-mocked 2018 Queen biopic <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>, pulling out after multiple cast and script changes. “There was a sense that nobody could agree on which story to tell,” he says, “and nothing against the surviving members of Queen, but they were very protective of Freddie’s legacy.”</p> <p>It’s something Flynn came up against again when cast as a young David Bowie in the 2020 biopic <em>Stardust</em>. Unlike the stage-to-screen jukebox vehicles, <em>Stardust</em> aimed to do something more ambitious: tell the tale of a pre-superstardom Bowie on his first trip to the US. Yet Bowie’s gatekeepers refused to license any of his music.</p> <p><em>The Score</em>, therefore, puts Flynn in a unique position. For once, he wasn’t an actor at the mercy of a musical gatekeeper. He <em>was</em> the musical gatekeeper.</p> <p>The film’s writer-director, Malachi Smyth, didn’t set out to write a gangster-musical, but was listening to Flynn’s music while writing it, then thought “something was missing, and realised he wanted to put in the songs”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48718f3243fafbd79833ab9369f16bf9d4b3e0b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48718f3243fafbd79833ab9369f16bf9d4b3e0b7/1512_913_6680_4008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I started playing morally dubious characters a few years ago, and it was such a relief’: Johnny Flynn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I started playing morally dubious characters a few years ago, and it was such a relief’: Johnny Flynn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Savage/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Flynn, though, read the script without any idea of his music’s proposed involvement.</p> <p>“I took it home and, page one, it’s like, ‘Oh, the characters are singing a Johnny Flynn song.’ I suppose my reaction was, wow, that’s weird. And also a small sense of… <em>I’ve</em> been writing musicals recently. You know? It’s something <em>I</em> wanted to do…”</p> <p>Like those gatekeepers of Queen and Bowie, he briefly pondered his legacy (“Some of the songs I wrote when I was 20 years old…”), but in the end said yes on one condition: under no circumstances, he told them, would he play the lead role. They agreed. It went to Poulter instead.</p> <p>As Flynn puts it: “There’d be something gross and vainglorious about playing the romantic lead in a film that’s using all my own songs…”</p> <p><em><strong>Until the age of four, </strong></em>Flynn lived in South Africa. His father found success there after moving to marry his second wife – Flynn’s mother. Aged three, Flynn was attacked by a Staffordshire bull terrier. The scars are barely perceptible now, but I tell him that a line referring to them in <em>The Score </em>(“You never forget a face like that. Trust me you try,” a character says at one point) made me wince. Wasn’t he bothered?</p> <p>No, he says. If anything, it’s helped his career. “I started playing morally dubious characters a few years ago, and it was such a relief, as I’d [previously] gone down the route of always being chosen to be the youthful, sunny type… The fact that my scars now help me to get more ambiguous casting? I’m really grateful.”</p> <p>It did affect him when he was younger. “For quite a while I wouldn’t take off my Spider-Man mask,” he says, “so I was obviously self-conscious. It was quite serious. I’m pretty lucky. The pictures from the time were awful. There’s just a massive hole in my cheek. I had to have reconstructive surgery.” Yet at school, he says, there was an upside. “I think it gave me a bit of kudos. My nickname at school was Scarface for a while. Which was better than the previous one, Rubber Johnny.”</p> <p>Flynn’s father, Eric, was an actor in musical theatre, introducing his son to both music and acting at a young age. Yet his father’s greatest desire, Flynn says, was that none of his children follow in his footsteps. In this he did not succeed: both of Flynn’s older brothers and his sister are actors.</p> <p>Flynn reckons the hope they’d choose a different path came from a place of care. When the family moved back to the UK, his father was regularly out of work. They moved home often, and there was little by way of stability. Flynn senior didn’t want the same for his kids, and made it clear. “My dad really tried to stop me,” Flynn has put it previously. “He wasn’t happy at all. I think because it had been pretty touch-and-go with paying our rent when I was a kid.”</p> <p>Despite the limited finances, Flynn attended two prestigious boarding schools on musical scholarships – first The Pilgrims’ School, in Winchester, where he learned the violin and the trumpet, then Bedales School, near Petersfield, by which time he’d taught himself the guitar.</p> <p>Flynn remembers his first school leading role – a one-act Harold Pinter play called<em> The Lover </em>consisting of just him and a co-star. He remembers the thrill of it; the intensity of acting. His father had come to watch, and Flynn ran towards him after the show, eager for approval. “And I remember for 10 minutes him talking about how amazing [his co-star] Tasha was. And then he turned to me and said: ‘You need to keep your hands still.’”</p> <p>“He sensed it was what I wanted to do, and so he needed me to get it right,” Flynn says now. Eric died from cancer when Flynn was 18. He still keeps his dad’s old Casio watch in a box that he and his wife, Beatrice Minns – with whom he has three children – keep on their mantelpiece, where they keep their most treasured possessions. It still, he says, smells of him. For a few years, Flynn also held on to hundreds of his father’s old polyester shirts, but eventually realised it was healthier to let them go.</p> <p>It was only when Flynn applied to drama school that he and his father really clashed regarding his artistic pursuits. His father wanted him to take an English degree and train as a teacher – something sensible, safe; something with options.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My nickname at school was Scarface for a while. Which was better than the previous one, Rubber Johnny</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Flynn got into Webber Douglas – a prestigious but unglamorous London drama school – just before his father died. Flynn thinks, he says, that his father would have ultimately been OK with that, even if he would have preferred his son had won a place at the more well-known Rada, from which he’d graduated.</p> <p>Yet it’s not hard to detect his father’s influence in Flynn’s insistence at keeping up his dual career paths. What better way to be practical? Before lockdown, Flynn had recorded his last two studio albums around performing. Often, he’ll record all day, before heading to the theatre at night.</p> <p>When he was younger, Flynn tells me, his father would often take him to play pool, but would never let his son win. He was only eight when they started to compete.</p> <p>“I’m making him sound incredibly cruel,” Flynn says, “he was very loving… there was an honesty to him. He was nothing but honest. He expected you to understand you had a handicap and the best you could do was do better than last time. It involved doing a lot of maths as a kid.”</p> <p>For Flynn, countless losses later, he identified a way to win in pool by exploiting his father’s longsightedness. “I just had to take seven years to work it out.” It was, he supposes, “a big, long, overarching life lesson”, though he isn’t entirely sure for what. Keep trying, perhaps? Success is hard, possibly? Or maybe just keep your options open, you never know when your big break will come.</p> <p>Next up, Flynn will be starring in a TV remake of <em>The Talented Mr Ripley</em>, playing the privileged Dickie Greenleaf opposite Andrew Scott’s Tom Ripley. No doubt there’ll be more theatre, more music, more compositions, too. For Flynn, however, the distinctions between the different worlds he straddles have started to fade.</p> <p>As with all his roles now, Flynn didn’t so much think of his latest part’s character, but about his rhythm: the tempo and pace with which he moves. It might be an unconventional approach to performance, but to hear Flynn talk about it, it’s obvious – at least to him. “I love breaking down characters in terms of rhythm because rhythm is a thing that defines us,” he says. “The way we move is how we meet the world.”</p> <p><em>The Score will be released in UK cinemas on 9 September</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/14/despite-climate-war-and-covid-is-everything-actually-getting-better","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T12:00:08Z","webTitle":"Despite climate, war and Covid, is everything actually … getting better?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/14/despite-climate-war-and-covid-is-everything-actually-getting-better","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/14/despite-climate-war-and-covid-is-everything-actually-getting-better","fields":{"headline":"Despite climate, war and Covid, is everything actually … getting better?","trailText":"The psychologist Steven Pinker has long believed we should be more optimistic – and even current crises do not dissuade him","byline":"David Robson","body":"<p>Reading and watching the media over the past year, you might be forgiven for thinking that we are facing the collapse of civilisation. We have a shrinking economy, a fuel crisis that may bring on energy rationing and forced blackouts, extreme weather events, the increased chance of nuclear war, and risk of the growth of a new pandemic riding on the back of the last. The Doomsday Clock – a symbol created by scientists to represent the likelihood of a human-made catastrophe – places us at just 100 seconds before midnight, the closest we’ve been to Armageddon in the project’s 75-year history.</p> <p>In the face of these threats, it may be hard to maintain a rose-tinted view of the future – unless, that is, you are the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. In 2018, his book <em>Enlightenment Now</em> argued that our interpretations of news events make us far too gloomy. There has never been a better time to be alive, he said, thanks to the social, economic, political, technological, and medical advances of the past 300 years.</p> <p>At the time of its publication, Pinker’s book attracted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/28/steven-pinker-celebrity-scientist-at-the-centre-of-the-culture-wars\" title=\"\">as much scorn as praise</a>. One common criticism was that he had oversimplified complex subjects and neglected any phenomena that might suggest a lack of progress. Pinker has, however, attempted to address many of the criticisms, and the recent challenges facing the world do not appear to have changed his opinion.</p> <p>On Radio 4’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0csf91x\" title=\"\"><em>Today</em> programme</a> last week, he revisited the arguments of <em>Enlightenment Now</em> to explain why he believes there are still reasons to remain optimistic in 2022. “We have to remember that there’s no law of nature that spaces bad things apart,” he said. “Bad things happen, and they will appear to come in clusters – but it doesn’t mean that we’re being punished for our collective sins or that we’re in a uniquely dangerous moment.” He maintains humanity has the tools to deal with the challenges we face.</p> <p>There is certainly something comforting about seeing cause for hope in crises. But do we really have good grounds for optimism? To find out, the <em>Observer</em> examines four indices of progress and the ways they have been affected by recent events.</p> <h2><strong>Health in the time of Covid</strong></h2> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic is the obvious place to start. According to the World Health Organization, more than 6.4 million have so far died of the infection, since the virus emerged. In a sample of 37 countries, the <em>British Medical Journal</em> found all but six had experienced a reduction in life expectancy as a result. That’s not to mention the burden of long Covid, which is thought to affect around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/two-million-people-in-uk-living-with-long-covid-say-studies\" title=\"\">two million people in the UK</a> alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5fc6e4cdf14625d2863271a427400aa2af846a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fc6e4cdf14625d2863271a427400aa2af846a5d/0_84_3397_4247/800.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of Steven Pinker in a jacket and shirt with his hands in his pockets\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pinker’s 2018 book Enlightenment Now attracted scorn from some quarters when it was published, but the author continues to defend its message.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is certainly a step backwards for global health. But it is worth noting that Pinker has never claimed that we will see continuous progress without any setbacks. His argument is more concerned with the ways we cope with problems and find potential solutions. Did we deal with the threat better than we would have been able to in years gone by?</p> <p>The jury is still out on the UK government’s initial response to the crisis. But the rapid development of Covid vaccines is undoubtedly a triumph of scientific progress. According to a recent study from Imperial College’s Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, the vaccination programme saved at least 14 million people – and potentially as many as 19.8 million – in its first year.</p> <p>This simply wouldn’t have been possible in years gone by; all previous vaccines had taken at least five years to develop, and at the start of the pandemic many scientists believed the possibility of creating a new one from scratch was naively optimistic. That may be some cause of optimism for our ability to deal with future health threats.</p> <h2><strong>Wealth and happiness</strong></h2> <p>One of <em>Enlightenment Now’s</em> core arguments is that people today are far wealthier than people in previous decades – and that this has resulted in higher life satisfaction, through greater comfort, more free time and better education. Pinker dismisses the idea that inequality is a driver of unrest – it is each person’s absolute wealth that matters, he says, which means we do not need to worry too much if much of a country’s gains in GDP go disproportionately to the richest echelons of society.</p> <p>The evidence for this is not quite as clearcut as Pinker would claim, however. <a href=\"https://docs.iza.org/dp13923.pdf\" title=\"\">Recent research</a> by veteran economist Richard Easterlin found that China’s and India’s recent economic growth have done very little for the population’s overall happiness. More comprehensively, a <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305750X17300049\" title=\"\">study</a> by Małgorzata Mikucka at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium analysed life satisfaction in 46 countries from 1981 to 2012. It found that an increase in GDP only brought about greater happiness if it was accompanied by reduced inequality and increased social capital.</p> <p>None of this bodes well for our lives over the next few months and years. The Office for National Statistics has just reported that the UK’s GDP has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/12/uk-economy-shrank-in-three-months-to-june\" title=\"\">shrunk in the second quarter of 2022,</a> suggesting that we are on the brink of a recession, while the average salary is set to fall behind inflation by 8% this year – the biggest drop in real wages in over 100 years. And according to the International Monetary Fund, the cost of living crisis is likely to widen inequality by hitting the poorest homes hardest.</p> <p>It’s worth remembering that, by the start of this year, real wages had not fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis – suggesting that this is more than a momentary blip in our living standards.</p> <h2><strong>War and peace</strong></h2> <p>One of Pinker’s most controversial claims concerns our propensity to kill each other. He first made the case that human violence is at an all-time low in<em> </em><em>The</em> <em>Better Angels of Our Nature,</em> published in 2011, and then revisited the idea seven years later in <em>Enlightenment Now</em>.</p> <p>Much of Pinker’s argument concerns warfare. Using data concerning the sheer number of conflicts, their length, the proportion of lives lost, and the level of military investment, Pinker notes a downward trend across the centuries.

It is possible for any probabilistic events to cluster in certain periods and to disappear in others. For an analogy, consider how many times you can throw a coin and it lands on tails, despite the probability being 50:50. You might conclude that the coin is biased – but with more throws the overall frequencies will tend to balance out. According to Clauset’s paper, the “long peace” may be similarly ephemeral.</p> <p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and growing tensions over Taiwan, have of course placed the thought of global war at the front of everyone’s minds. We can hope that diplomacy will prevent disaster, but optimistic historical analyses provide cold comfort when our fate can depend on the erratic decisions of dictators such as Vladimir Putin.</p> <h2><strong>The environment</strong></h2> <p>With the record-breaking heatwaves this year, and the threat of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/uk-cities-need-to-prepare-for-future-wildfires-say-fire-chiefs\" title=\"\">wildfires sweeping across the UK</a>, it feels like we are already witnessing the start of the climate emergency – and unless we take drastic action, it is only set to worsen.</p> <p>Pinker certainly doesn’t deny climate change, which he acknowledges is a “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1429953052723744772?lang=en-GB\" title=\"\">gargantuan problem</a>”, but he has criticised “eco-pessimism” and the prevalence of what he considers to be alarmist green messaging. In <em>Enlightenment Now, </em>he describes many environmental successes, such as the reduction of water pollution, the elimination of acid rain and a recent deceleration in deforestation. He points to data showing that many countries’ CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are now plateauing. For an escape route from disaster, he points to ideas such as carbon taxing, combined with a reliance on nuclear power and technologies such as carbon capture, which involves scrubbing CO<sub>2 </sub>from power stations before it is released and locking it underground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1429953052723744772\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Climate Change is a gargantuan problem, but the idea it threatens imminent human extinction or destruction of civilization is pernicious.

Technologies such as carbon capture do offer some promise, but their efficacy is unproven. And we will also require strong political will, which has been far from obvious in the years since Pinker’s book was published. A <a href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2021/sgsm20604.doc.htm\" title=\"\">UN report</a> from 2021 found most governments were “nowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5C and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement”, though it is possible that a drive to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas could galvanise efforts to switch to renewables.</p> <p>Pinker’s optimism relies on the fact that we – and our governments – will act rationally, according to the Enlightenment principles of reason, science and humanism. Our combined brainpower may certainly have the capacity to solve the climate crisis, but to believe that our politicians will take action in time – that may require a leap of faith.</p> <p><em>David Robson is the author of </em><em>The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life</em> </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/14/irvine-welsh-porno-review-gutsy-trainspotting-sequel-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T11:43:09Z","webTitle":"Irvine Welsh’s Porno review – coarse and gutsy Trainspotting sequel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/irvine-welsh-porno-review-gutsy-trainspotting-sequel-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/14/irvine-welsh-porno-review-gutsy-trainspotting-sequel-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Irvine Welsh’s Porno review – coarse and gutsy Trainspotting sequel","trailText":"Welsh’s band of unruly misfits reunite – 15 years older – in an intense, dark farce that rushes to a conclusion all too soon","byline":"Mark Fisher","body":"<p>For all that the characters of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/12/trainspotting-review-danny-boyle-classic-t2\">Trainspotting</a> lurked on the perilous fringes, they were at least young enough for the slogan “choose life” to be an option.

In 2022, we have had the first and will soon get the second. Few would be entirely surprised if the third arrived by the end of the year.</p> <p>As has been the case this year, in the summer of 1976 people enjoyed the sunshine and seemed not to care much about high inflation. According to a 2004 report from the New Economics Foundation thinktank, the UK has <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0331/p01s03-woeu.html\">never been happier</a> than it was in the year when Denis Howell was made the drought minister, Concorde made its first commercial flight and the Sex Pistols released Anarchy in the UK.</p> <p>However, as the year wore on, the economic problems intensified. James Callaghan, who had taken over as prime minister from Harold Wilson in April, was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund for financial support. An IMF team spent the autumn coming up with a package that involved painful spending cuts. The diaries of Tony Benn, the then energy minister, reveal how split the cabinet was between those who reluctantly supported austerity and those – such as Benn – who thought Britain should try to grow its way out of trouble.</p> <p>The UK is now less than a month away from getting a new prime minister and for either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss the challenge looks as daunting as it did for Callaghan. The economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/12/uk-economy-shrank-in-three-months-to-june\">contracted by 0.1%</a> in the second quarter of 2022, which was actually slightly better than expected, but the growth figures do not really capture the fundamental weakness of the economy. A better guide to that are the trade figures, which are truly appalling. As Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, pointed out, the trade deficit expressed as a percentage of GDP has been bigger in the first six months of 2022 than in any comparable period since quarterly records began in 1955. The position is only going to get worse in the second half of 2022 as the bill for imported gas rises sharply. Sterling looks vulnerable, Tombs says, and he is right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dda4476d0b7fe3b4104f71485cd075b797158af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dda4476d0b7fe3b4104f71485cd075b797158af/29_32_3441_2066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak campaigns at an event in Bexhill on 5 August\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak campaigns at an event in Bexhill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are plenty of things that might trigger a run on the pound. Inflation could overshoot the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-1-point-75-per-cent-in-biggest-hike-in-27-years\">Bank of England’s 13% forecast</a>, the recession could arrive sooner and be deeper than expected. Financial markets would react badly to any social unrest that followed October’s increase in the energy price cap. They are also worried about Truss’s hints that she will meddle with the independence of the Bank of England.</p> <p>In some ways, the struggle between Truss and Sunak mirrors that between Callaghan and Benn in 1976: one more cautious and the other more radical. With one difference. If the polls are right, this time the radical – Truss – is going to win. She aims to revitalise the right in the way Margaret Thatcher did in the 1970s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Truss’s economic approach seems to owe much to Joseph Schumpeter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That will prove some task. Thatcher was leader of the opposition in 1976 at a time when postwar social democracy looked to be played out. Her argument that tough action was needed to curb inflation and union power found an echo. The country was ready for a period of austerity, even though in 1976 it had no idea just how tough the austerity would be.</p> <p>Truss’s economic approach seems to owe much to Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who championed creative destruction as a way of constantly reinvigorating capitalism. To be sure, there is an argument – strongly made by Edward Chancellor in his new book The Price of Time – that a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates has misallocated capital and stifled productivity growth by keeping zombie companies in existence.</p> <p>But neither emotionally nor intellectually does Britain seem to be ready for a government that allows – even encourages – firms to go bust in their droves. Truss is also swimming against the tide if she thinks this is a country that would prefer cuts in taxation rather than money off their energy bills. The massive package of support provided to sustain the economy through the coronavirus pandemic set a precedent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sunak seems more in tune with the public mood but he, too, is an instinctive small-state Conservative trying to come to terms with the fact that this is now big-state Britain. Between 1997 and 2010, when faith in free markets and globalisation was absolute, Britain had a left-of-centre government that struggled to find a way of adapting to the prevailing orthodoxy. Since 2010 it has had a series of rightwing administrations struggling to adapt to a world that – as far as the economy is concerned – has been leaning leftwards. In their different ways Theresa May and Boris Johnson understood this, which is why they talked about helping the “just about managing” and “levelling up”.</p> <p>Despite the grim outlook for the economy, there is still a possibility that the Conservatives could win a fifth term. Inflation will start to fall rapidly in the second half of next year. Growth and living standards might be rising by 2024. Voters might not be convinced that Labour would be significantly different. The election might be fought on the basis of culture wars rather than the economy.</p> <p>But even to get to the stage where it is competitive at the next election, the government has to avoid a full-strength economic crisis. The choice is simple. Provide massive and speedy assistance so people can heat their homes and have a relatively mild recession, or refuse to act and have a monster recession. It is not a question of whether the winter ahead is going to be grim but of just how grim. And, if Truss wins, whether the lady is for turning.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/14/liz-truss-ally-simon-clarke-energy-fuel-bill-payments","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T11:06:36Z","webTitle":"Truss may stop high earners getting £400 energy bill payments, ally hints","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/liz-truss-ally-simon-clarke-energy-fuel-bill-payments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/14/liz-truss-ally-simon-clarke-energy-fuel-bill-payments","fields":{"headline":"Truss may stop high earners getting £400 energy bill payments, ally hints","trailText":"Chief secretary to Treasury Simon Clarke says it is ‘pretty odd’ that wealthier people will benefit from payments","byline":"Andrew Sparrow Political correspondent","body":"<p>One of Liz Truss’s key ministerial allies has hinted she might stop wealthy people receiving the £400 energy bills payout coming from the Treasury later this year.</p> <p>The chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, said he found it “pretty odd” that high earners would benefit from the payments, which were announced in May by Rishi Sunak, the then chancellor, as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/26/sunak-u-turns-on-energy-profits-levy-in-15bn-cost-of-living-package\">£15bn energy support package</a>.</p> <p>Clarke was speaking in an <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/08/13/liz-truss-could-strip-high-earners-400-energy-bill-help/\">interview with</a> the Sunday Telegraph in his capacity as an advocate for the Truss campaign, which over the past week has been revising its stance on energy bills and seeking to quash suggestions that Truss is opposed to offering those most in need targeted support.</p> <p>Clarke was Sunak’s deputy in May when the Treasury announced that from October every household would get the £400 payments, mostly paid in instalments as rebates on energy bills. This was the universal element in a package that diverted most of the extra £15bn available to payments for those most in need.</p> <p>In his interview, Clarke said: “I do find it pretty odd that high earners are receiving £400 off their bills. As Conservatives, we ought to surely believe in targeting taxpayer money as best we can so that we actually achieve the best value and keep the burden on the exchequer as low as we can.</p> <p>“It is not an ideal outcome, putting it very mildly, that people who don’t need it are receiving quite substantial sums of money from the state. That is not, frankly, a targeted package, is it?”</p> <p>At the start of the Tory leadership campaign, Truss suggested the main measures she would implement as prime minister that might help people with rising energy bills would be the reversal of the national insurance rise and the temporary removal of green levies on energy bills.</p> <p>Truss brushed aside complaints that these measures would do little to help those most in need – and that the national insurance cut would help high earners most – and in an interview with the Financial Times this month she appeared to rule out one-off payments to those most in need. “I would do things in a Conservative way of lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts,” she said when asked what she would do about energy bills.</p> <p>But that remark was seen as a mistake, and within days Truss was stressing that she was offering people targeted support with energy bills. Clarke’s interview suggests the Truss campaign is trying to present itself as even more in favour of targeted support than Sunak, who defends the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/13/as-the-dwp-starts-handing-out-cost-of-living-payments-who-is-eligible\">universal £400 payments</a>.</p> <p>Two of Truss’s key supporters – the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Thérèse Coffey, the current work and pensions secretary – are reportedly urging her to use universal credit as a means of getting extra help with energy bills to those most in need.</p> <p>The Truss campaign has not said she would definitely stop wealthy people getting the £400 payments, or how that might be achieved. Universal payments are easy to administer; means testing is much more complicated and best managed through the benefits system.</p> <p>In his interview, Clarke attacked another of Sunak’s policies as chancellor – his decision to give UK backing to a G7-supported plan for a minimum corporation tax of 15%. “There is no question whatever that we didn’t come out of the European Union to fetter our discretion on issues like that,” Clarke said.</p> <p>Truss agreed, he claimed. “I know she would not allow her government to find itself artificially constrained,” he said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/14/black-and-female-by-tsitsi-dangarembga-review-a-womans-defiant-fight-to-write","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T11:00:07Z","webTitle":"Black and Female by Tsitsi Dangarembga review – a woman’s defiant fight to write","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/black-and-female-by-tsitsi-dangarembga-review-a-womans-defiant-fight-to-write","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/14/black-and-female-by-tsitsi-dangarembga-review-a-womans-defiant-fight-to-write","fields":{"headline":"Black and Female by Tsitsi Dangarembga review – a woman’s defiant fight to write","trailText":"The Zimbabwean author celebrates the act of artistic creation while exploring the colonial, racial and gender biases she has faced","byline":"Bidisha Mamata","body":"<p>Zimbabwean writer Tsitsi Dangarembga is the much-heralded author of numerous novels, including the Booker-shortlisted <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/12/this-mournable-body-by-tsitsi-dangarembga-review\">This Mournable Body</a></em> and <em>Nervous Condition</em><em>s</em>, winner of the Commonwealth writers’ prize. In this short, serious and powerful nonfiction piece, she undertakes a deep dive into the consequences of racism and misogyny on her development as an author, a thinker and a woman in the world. She is inextricably shaped by sex, race, nationality and class – and yet writing also enables her to adjust and transcend these categories, to establish counter-narratives and expanded viewpoints.</p> <p>She starts with a punchy history of Zimbabwe – formerly called Rhodesia – and follows on to examine the impact of empire, colonisation and patriarchy on her life and that of her nation and generation: “The first wound for all of us who are classified as ‘black’ is empire. This is a truth many of us – whether we are included in that category or not – prefer to avoid. Today, the wounding empire is that of the western nations: the empire that covered more than 80% of the globe at its zenith in the 19th century. It includes the British empire that colonised my country Zimbabwe in the 1890s. I was born into empire: my parents were products of empire, as were their parents before them, and their parents before that, my great-grandparents.”</p> <p>Her essay is a celebration of artistic creation at the same time as an acknowledgment of unjust worldly realities. She has a talent for taking activist buzzwords, around women’s agency or the importance of decolonising the canon, and examining how powerful yet difficult it is to pull up the deep structural and psychological roots of patriarchy and empire: “Being categorised as black and female does not constrain my writing. Writing assures me that I am more than merely blackness and femaleness… What writing while black and female does constrain for me is access to publication opportunities, and when I am published, avenues to reputable, professional publishing houses and lucrative contracts, money being the currency of empire.”</p> <p>As Dangarembga frames it, pain, anger, injustice and resilience can also be the starter fuel in the development of necessary personal drive, a creative viewpoint and transformative political power: “This is the sort of agency that black feminists, and in particular black African feminists of conscience, exhibit. It is the result of an unrelenting fight for survival and dignity.”</p> <p><em>• Black and Female</em> by Tsitsi Dangarembga is published by Faber (£9.99).

Since its first performance in 1855 it has been fashionable to decry the piece as overly flamboyant, though Wang and Mäkelä revealed just how much depth there is to it, and what an impact it can make when taken seriously and properly handled.</p> <p>Wang’s formidable technique and remarkable dynamic control allowed her both to hurl the opening flourishes out with terrific force and produce exquisite pianissimos in the adagio, which is sometimes described as an operatic aria without words and structured round one of Liszt’s most beautiful melodies. The scherzo was filigree-light, the martial finale propulsively energetic without a trace of pomposity. Finding an underlying unity in disparity, Mäkelä made perfect sense of the score’s stylistic veering between almost Wagnerian weight and an airy brilliance that derives from the French music of the time. It was all something of a revelation, even to those like myself who are fond of the work.</p> <p>Wang capped it with two encores: Horowitz’s bravura Carmen Variations, flung out with devil-may-care panache and glamour, and, at the opposite extreme, a transcription of the Dance of the Blessed Spirits from Gluck’s Orphée, marvellous in its poetic introspection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fdd47d598dc020c0bfd179f2544e4f56339e4db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fdd47d598dc020c0bfd179f2544e4f56339e4db/0_63_1920_1151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unity in disparity … Klaus Mäkelä.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panache … Klaus Mäkelä.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Christodoulou</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was flanked by two of the great tone-poems: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/09/sibelius-where-to-start-with-his-music\">Sibelius</a>’s Tapiola and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/18/strauss-where-to-start-with-his-music-tim-ashley\">Strauss</a>’s Ein Heldenleben. Gaunt, bleak and an unsetting piece with which to start, Sibelius’s evocation of the vast Finnish forests was eerie and disquieting, its organic development and patterns of stasis and movement, tension and release, all superbly controlled. Mäkelä doesn’t linger over Strauss, and his Heldenleben was swift and unsentimental, by turns exalted and, in its closing pages, extremely touching. In both works the playing was superb in its commitment, panache and detail. At the end of an evening in which virtuosity as well as exceptional musicianship were paramount, the orchestra gave us the <em>csárdás</em> from Johann Strauss’s Ritter Pásmán as the most exhilarating encore imaginable.

Ten years later, the girls are reunited accidentally at a summer camp. Adapted twice by Disney, the magic of film made us believe that one actor was two sisters (Hayley Mills in 1961, Lindsay Lohan in 1998). <em><a href=\"https://nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/events/identical/\">Identical</a></em>, a new musical version of the story instigated by producer Kenny Wax, uses a more potent magic: real twins play the lead roles. At the performance I saw, these were the excellent Savannah and Sienna Robinson (other performances feature Kyla and Nicole Fox and Eden and Emme Patrick). Although the stage decor is stunning (a continually surprising combination of old and new – video projections on to flats and backdrops), it is these two small girls who provide the most amazing visual effect of all. “You have my face!” Lisa exclaims the first time they meet: they seem indistinguishable.</p> <p>As the story shows, however, there is more to an individual than their appearance. Lisa and Lottie’s distinctive tastes and abilities become apparent when they sneakily swap lives. Lisa’s composer father (James Darch) is amazed by his daughter’s hitherto unsuspected talent for music, while Lottie’s journalist mother (Emily Tierney) is delighted by her girl’s newfound enthusiasm for camping. The tale of a fractured family reunited resonates, parable-like, in our present, fractious time. In the final family reunion, what moves both parents and audience is the way the girls’ individual talents combine to create a new song – and establish family harmony.</p> <p>Stuart Paterson’s book follows the novel in setting the action in Munich and Vienna of 1950. While the period look is entrancing, some lingering, last-century attitudes jar: the calculating, man-catcher portrayal of the composer’s ballerina girlfriend, in particular, strikes a sour note. George Stiles’s new music, though, is emotionally pitch-perfect, now bright, now dark, now surging joyously, coupled with witty lyrics from Anthony Drewe. Direction, as might be expected from Trevor Nunn, is elegant and performances are both sharp and warm, but the production’s greatest strength is the magic of the identical girls. <strong> </strong></p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 August 2022 to give the original German title of Erich Kästner’s 1949 novel, <em>Das doppelte Lottchen</em>.</p> <ul> <li><p>Identical is at <a href=\"https://nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/events/identical/\">Nottingham Playhouse</a> until 14 August and the <a href=\"https://thelowry.com/whats-on/identical/\">Lowry, Salford</a>, from 19 August to 3 September</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/14/nomad-century-how-to-survive-the-climate-upheaval-by-gaia-vince-review-a-world-without-borders","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T10:30:07Z","webTitle":"Nomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval by Gaia Vince review – a world without borders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/nomad-century-how-to-survive-the-climate-upheaval-by-gaia-vince-review-a-world-without-borders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/14/nomad-century-how-to-survive-the-climate-upheaval-by-gaia-vince-review-a-world-without-borders","fields":{"headline":"Nomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval by Gaia Vince review – a world without borders","trailText":"In an optimistic new work, the author of Adventures in the Anthropocene argues that planned mass migration is essential for humanity to inhabit a world 4C warmer","byline":"Bob Ward","body":"<p><a href=\"https://wanderinggaia.com/about-me/\">Gaia Vince</a>’s new book should be read not just by every politician, but by every person on the planet, because it lays out, much more clearly than any existing scientific assessment, the world we are creating through global heating. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/nomad-century-9780241522318\">Nomad Century</a></em> is the much-anticipated follow-up to Vince’s award-winning book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/23/adventures-in-the-anthropocene-by-gaia-vance-review\">Adventures in the Anthropocene</a></em>, which explained how human impacts on Earth have created a new geological epoch. In this new work, the author makes the pessimistic, but entirely plausible, assumption that by the end of this century the Earth will be 4C warmer than during the period before industrialisation. And while this may sound like the stuff of nightmares, she also offers an optimistic vision of how humans might cope after rendering large swathes of the globe uninhabitable – through massive migration towards the poles.</p> <p>The early chapters outline a dystopian future, based on scientific projections of a world that will soon be warmer than at any time for tens of millions of years. This, she says, is what awaits us if we carry on failing to drastically reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases: coastlines will be transformed by rising sea levels and stronger tropical storms, forests razed by wildfires, drought-stricken fields will lie barren, and deserts will expand to swallow up villages and towns. Other communities will be wiped out by terrible floods, or abandoned because of a lack of rainfall.</p> <p>In a growing zone around the equator, temperature and humidity will be so high that people will be unable to prevent themselves from overheating through sweating, making it dangerous to undertake any strenuous activity outdoors. Faced with such an inhospitable environment, Vince argues, humans will do what we have been doing throughout our evolutionary history: we will move. But this time it will be in our billions, on a scale never seen before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bc83fed5d73c9f6cb7a65dd802befd31d2d3033\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc83fed5d73c9f6cb7a65dd802befd31d2d3033/0_2250_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gaia Vince\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gaia Vince: the UN should offer global citizenship to everybody, she says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sent by publishers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of these migrants will try to move north from the tropics, seeking to settle eventually in countries such as Canada and Russia, where the climate will have changed but which will still be inhabitable. This flow of humanity has already started, and will only increase over the coming decades. Some will move because their livelihoods have been destroyed by the changing climate, others will be refugees who have lost their homes to extreme weather events that have become more frequent and intense.</p> <p>Vince provides a short history of human migration, explaining that it has been key to the success of our species in settling across the globe. Without migration, modern humans would never have ventured beyond their origin in Africa. The author then moves on to a passionate and powerful presentation of the benefits of migration. She highlights the wealth of evidence showing that it enriches both migrants and their destinations and attacks the rhetoric of British politicians and media who seek to demonise asylum seekers who arrive on our shores.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We do now have to contemplate an extraordinary future in which the impacts of climate change make the migration of billions inevitable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She points out that the creation of political boundaries to prevent people from moving unchecked about the globe is a relatively new development in human history. It is, in many ways, an unnatural restriction of our fundamental freedoms. She also illustrates the desperation of many current migrants by describing her visit to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/aug/07/rohingya-rebuild-camps-again-21000-displaced-floods-bangladesh-coxs-bazar\">Kutupalong refugee camp</a> in Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya\">Rohingya</a> have sought sanctuary from persecution in Myanmar. She notes that the camp is in effect a poorly planned city in which human potential is being wasted, breeding a sense of hopelessness.</p> <p>But it does not have to be this way, Vince argues. The coming migration of billions of people from the tropics can be planned, with new cities constructed to accommodate the climate migrants and provide them with the opportunity to build new lives. Already across the world there has been a mass exodus from the countryside to cities, but unplanned urban development had led to a proliferation of slums and shantytowns. However, China has more successfully managed the flow of about 400 million people into its cities over the past three decades through huge construction and infrastructure programmes.</p> <p>There are plenty of examples in which large populations of migrants have been successfully integrated into their new communities through enlightened policymaking. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/21/refugee-migrants-berlin-walking-tours-neukolln-sonnenallee\">Neukölln neighbourhood of Berlin</a>, for instance, welcomed tens of thousands of refugees from Syria’s brutal civil war, creating new jobs and economic opportunities.</p> <p>Vince makes clear that political hostility to migrants is often based on prejudice rather than fact. Millions of refugees from Ukraine have been accepted by European countries that simultaneously claim they cannot possibly cope with the influx of smaller numbers across the Mediterranean. One way of ensuring a more just treatment of climate migrants, she suggests, is for the United Nations to create a new organisation for global migration, and to offer global citizenship to everybody alongside their national citizenships.</p> <p>Vince’s deeply humane vision of facilitated mass migration may seem unrealistic against the current backdrop of hysteria about asylum seekers in many parts of Europe and the United States. But we do now have to contemplate an extraordinary future in which the impact of global heating makes the migration of billions inevitable. Unfortunately, the same politicians who are failing to deal properly with migration are the same ones we are depending on to avoid dangerous climate breakdown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/25/gaia-vince-humans-are-causing-untold-damage-to-planet-anthropocene\">Gaia Vince: humans have caused untold damage to the planet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vince is optimistic about our chances of successfully managing the massive dislocation caused by warming of 4C, and does not dwell on the alternative: a world that does not cope with the displacement of billions of people.

United had just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/sep/14/young-boys-manchester-united-champions-league-group-f-match-report\" title=\"\">lost away to Young Boys</a>. They had not played well at Southampton or Wolves.

Ole Gunnar Solskjær, though, was good at setting up his team to sit deep and play on the break – at least until Cristiano Ronaldo was signed, depriving the forward line of pace and mobility and so destroying the one viable approach United had, and undermining dressing-room morale while he was at it.</p> \n<p>At Brentford on Saturday, United were decked out in Stabilo green, as though somebody had highlighted where all the problems were. There’s not a single element of this side that works. Confidence is shot. Basics have gone. None of the parts fit together.</p> \n<p>There are complaints about a lack of signing from the Glazers, but this is a squad that has been expensively assembled; the starting XI cost eight times that of Brentford. The problem is that it has been put together extraordinarily badly, with no long-term vision, and zero understanding of football. The present scramble for new players is entirely typical: every player United are linked with is either well-known (or, more often, notorious: Marko Arnautovic! Adrien Rabiot! Mauro Icardi!) or familiar to Erik ten Hag from the Eredivisie.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"43297fadc1edc8e9d50cc46e35d31950bcc54920\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43297fadc1edc8e9d50cc46e35d31950bcc54920/0_0_3000_1876/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United players trudge back to the centre circle, looking miserable, after conceding to Brentford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United’s season is in turmoil after only two games.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To say that Ten Hag isn’t a match for this squad is both true and pointless: nobody is, nobody could be. Can you play Lisandro Martínez, a 5ft 9in centre-back, in the Premier League? It’s always going to be a risk, but it is doable, if he has a dominant partner to win aerial battles and if the side is able to control the match.</p> \n<p>If he’s playing alongside an out-of-sorts Harry Maguire and opponents can put in eight crosses before half-time, then it’s a glaring weakness. Can you play Christian Eriksen as the deepest‑lying midfielder? Surely he wasn’t signed for that? Again, though, it’s not impossible; with a ferocious snapper to protect him, perhaps he could function as a deep-lying playmaker in the style of Andrea Pirlo. But Fred is no Rino Gattuso.</p> \n<p>The opening goal was, obviously, primarily the fault of David de Gea, but the gap Josh Dasilva exploited was left by Fred so there was no cover when Ronaldo was dispossessed. Letting in the shot was bad, but letting the shot happen exposed structural failings.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/erik-ten-hag-the-manchester-united-team-has-to-take-responsibility\">Erik ten Hag says Manchester United players put tactical plan ‘in the bin’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Can you press with this squad? United managed just seven pressures in the final third all game, 14 fewer than Brentford. Ralf Rangnick last season despaired of the lack of basic tactical understanding in the squad; most, he said, had simply never been drilled in ball-oriented pressing. He spent half an hour working one-on-one with one high-profile player, thought he made a breakthrough, but then watched him produce his worst performance of the season in the following match.</p> \n<p>Can you play out from the back with De Gea? De Gea remains, despite Saturday’s howler, an excellent shot-stopper, which is why last season he was named United’s player of the year for the fourth time. But there is a reason he has not played for Spain since October 2020 and why he has apparently fallen behind Brentford’s David Raya in the pecking order. “A goalkeeper,” the Spain manager Luis Enrique said in June, “should start the play and generate the first superiority, they must dominate the aerial play.”</p> \n<p>De Gea cannot do that because he is simply not comfortable on the ball. Last season he completed just 71.3% of his passes. By comparison, Ederson completed 88.1% and Alisson 87.1%; while it’s true that’s partly because De Gea was encouraged to play more longer balls, it’s also true that one of the reasons United played more longer balls is De Gea.</p> \n<p>The long unbeaten away run ended with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/16/leicester-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 4‑2 defeat at Leicester</a> in which Maguire, forced back early from an ankle injury, couldn’t adjust quickly enough to an underhit pass from De Gea, leading to Youri Tielemans’s equaliser. </p> \n<p>The goalkeeper’s loss of form at the 2018 World Cup was widely blamed on a loss of confidence provoked by his discomfort at being asked to play behind a high line and pass out from the back, which reached its nadir in the second goal he conceded against Portugal, a soft Ronaldo shot that slithered under his body much as Dasilva’s did on Saturday.</p> \n<p>This is a major problem for United: De Gea is one of the few United players who has performed consistently in recent years and yet those struggles with the ball at his feet make it very hard for them to switch to a modern style. It’s not by any means the only reason why the Rangnick interregnum failed, nor is it anything like the only reason why Ten Hag cannot fit this United into his Ajax template, but it is fundamental.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b9db6ab-3762-4f8e-9dc7-f2c4ed3da970\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9w2pSALcsqk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The analogy with Pep Guardiola’s prompt decision to jettison Joe Hart is clear. Perhaps Ten Hag has raised the issue, but the mind boggles at who this United board might come up with as a replacement after thumbing through their ageing directory of high-maintenance bad boys. Kepa Arrizabalaga? Jens Lehmann? Toni Schumacher?</p> \n<p>But what happens next? A clearout is desperately needed (even after offloading four senior players this summer) but what’s the point if there’s no idea how to replace them? Half a century ago, United responded to the defeat at Selhurst Park by sacking Frank O’Farrell and George Best. Moving on Ronaldo might be a start, but Ten Hag is even less an author of the chaos than O’Farrell was.</p> \n<p>That, perhaps, is the most disconcerting thing for United. This is supposed to be Ten Hag’s honeymoon period, but already he looks in danger of being overwhelmed by just how shambolic the club is. Like Rangnick, he cannot play his football with these players; he perhaps cannot play any football. And they’ve got Liverpool next.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-teaches-us-an-invaluable-lesson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T10:18:06Z","webTitle":"Salman Rushdie teaches us an invaluable lesson | Jill Filipovic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-teaches-us-an-invaluable-lesson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-teaches-us-an-invaluable-lesson","fields":{"headline":"Salman Rushdie teaches us an invaluable lesson","trailText":"It is courageous and necessary to stand up against tyrants – even when those tyrants claim to have God on their side","byline":"Jill Filipovic","body":"<p>Salman Rushie has spent decades living under threat from religious zealots after a religious leader in Iran called for him to be put to death for the alleged blasphemy of his book The Satanic Verses. On Friday, an assailant attacked Rushdie in Chautauqua, New York, stabbing the 75-year-old author multiple times. Rushdie is now reportedly on a ventilator with serious injuries and may lose an eye, according to his agent Andrew Wylie. A 24-year-old New Jersey man named Hadi Matar is in custody.</p> <p>Even with a decades-long fatwa hanging over Rushdie, the attack is still shocking. While he spent many years in hiding after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini put a fatwa on his head, and there was a $3m bounty offered for his murder, the author has, in recent years, been much more public. Initially, he tried to be reasonable: he said he regretted hurting people’s feelings (“I profoundly regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam,” he said in 1989), and he <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-address.html?_r=2\">suspended</a> the paperback release of the book to let the dust settle – a move he said later he <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-address.html?_r=2\">regretted</a>.</p> <p>Since then, Rushdie has not apologized for creating art that offended the delicate sensibilities of religious people who can’t seem to let God handle his own business. He has refused to cower in the face of so many calls to violence. His refusal to hide or take his work back also reveals the cravenness of those who have long sought to justify or downplay the threats on his life – a group that includes, shamefully, a number of self-styled <a href=\"https://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc1381.html\">liberals</a>.</p> <p>Standing up to extremism and standing for the rights of free speech and expression, particularly in the face of threats to one’s life, is laudable and incredibly brave. The world should have rallied around Rushdie when he initially came under threat. Appallingly, it did not. Now, though, with the benefit of hindsight and the understanding of the immediate, life-threatening stakes, we can collectively change course.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The attack on Rushdie is abhorrent, but it is not isolated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People who believe criticism, mockery, or even insult to religion should never be a crime, let alone a capital offense – decent people, in other words – should speak up for Rushdie, and against the many nations worldwide that criminalize <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/25/four-in-ten-countries-and-territories-worldwide-had-blasphemy-laws-in-2019-2/\">blasphemy</a>. As of 2019, some 40% of countries worldwide had blasphemy laws on the books. That’s not just backwards and dangerous, it’s embarrassing. Certainly any god worth worshipping is able to handle petty insults on his own – and if he believes that taunting an all-powerful and omniscient being is grounds for death, why in the world are you worshipping that guy?</p> <p>The attack on Rushdie is abhorrent, but it is not isolated. Others who have been accused of criticizing or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/world/europe/france-online-harassment-trial.html\">insulting</a> religion have also faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/09/death-threats-sent-to-participants-of-us-conference-on-hindu-nationalism\">threats</a> to their lives; many have been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/africa/nigerian-atheist-jailed-blasphemy-intl/index.html\">imprisoned</a> and even sentenced to <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/2/21/sentenced-to-death-for-blasphemy-surviving-pakistans-death-row\">death</a>; others have been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/world/europe/france-beheading-teacher.html\">murdered</a> for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/charlie-hebdo-attack\">insisting</a> on free expression.</p> <p>Attacks on free speech run the gamut. While violence is obviously shocking and appalling, we should also reject attempts to shut down texts or other pieces of art simply because they offend someone’s beliefs. Of course every culture has its taboos. One question worth asking is whether a particular taboo is worth enforcing either legally or socially; to answer that, we have to assess the potential harm in breaking it. Social rules – and certainly legal rules – that are simply about protecting privileged people from hurt feelings or challenging ideas, and where the harm is no larger than taking offense because of one’s religious or other beliefs, should fall.</p> <p>And yet the world over, people insist on erecting them. In the US, religious conservatives have long sought to use the power of the state to shut down speech and expression they dislike, from pulling arts funding because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/charlie-hebdo-attack\">pieces</a> that offend Christians to <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/11/texas-library-book-ban-granbury/\">attempting</a> to <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/book-banning-republicans-gender-queer-obscenity-supreme-court.html\">ban books</a> because they are about queer identity and therefore “obscene” to pushing state laws that limit how teachers can discuss gender and sexual orientation. And liberals have their censorious impulses too, although, importantly, they seem inclined to rely on <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/88998-how-free-is-free-expression.html\">cultural</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/books/in-an-era-of-online-outrage-do-sensitivity-readers-result-in-better-books-or-censorship.html\">institutions</a> and businesses more than the state. Globally, free speech is <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/12/americans-more-tolerant-of-offensive-speech-than-others-in-the-world/\">depressingly under-supported</a>. And as of 2015, 40% of young people in the US troublingly told <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/12/americans-more-tolerant-of-offensive-speech-than-others-in-the-world/\">researchers</a> they were OK with the government limiting speech if that speech was offensive to minority groups.</p> <p>“Free speech is the whole thing, the whole ball game,” Rushdie <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-address.html?_r=2\">told</a> an audience at Columbia University in 1991, as he continued to live under siege. “Free speech is life itself.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/salman-rushdie-had-started-to-believe-his-life-was-normal-again\">Salman Rushdie had started to believe his ‘life was normal again’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And that includes, absolutely, the right to offend. People may think you’re a jerk; they may tell you you’re being offensive; depending on the speech or the art and the context, you may lose friends or supporters, and you may deserve it (Rushdie, for the record, did not deserve it). But no one deserves to be threatened or criminally penalized for their work or for words that simply caused offense. And frankly, we would collectively be better off if we could engage with, criticize, and even reject pieces of literature or art without calling for their removal or censorship. We would absolutely be better off if we stopped treating religion as a special category of belief for which no insult is justified, and which is deserving of special levels of deference (not to mention, in the US, vast privileges and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/amid-calls-to-taxthechurches-what-and-how-much-do-us-religious-organizations-not-pay-the-taxman-164988\">benefits</a>, including to <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/religious-liberty-no-harm/\">discriminate</a>, not accorded to other groups).</p> <p>Religion is a belief system. If yours cannot stand up to criticism, interrogation, and even mockery or insult – if you need to threaten or punish, up to the point of death, those who insult an idea you hold dear – it is perhaps worth asking if your beliefs are as strong as you believe they are. And this is the lesson of Salman Rushdie: it is courageous and necessary to stand up against tyrants and those who would use violence to suppress words and art – even when those tyrants claim to have God on their side.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jill Filipovic is the author of the The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/14/drought-in-england-could-carry-on-into-new-year-experts-warn","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Drought in England could carry on into new year, experts warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/14/drought-in-england-could-carry-on-into-new-year-experts-warn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/14/drought-in-england-could-carry-on-into-new-year-experts-warn","fields":{"headline":"Drought in England could carry on into new year, experts warn","trailText":"Without lots of heavy rain in autumn and winter, water restrictions could be tightened even further","byline":"Helena Horton and Fiona Harvey","body":"<p>South-east England could be tipped into severe and devastating drought without above-average rainfall this winter, while current water use restrictions in London and surrounding areas are expected to last until the new year even if rainfall returns, ministers have been told.

One Whitehall source said officials were being told to prepare for a potential severe drought throughout the south-east.</p> <p>Drought falls into four categories: prolonged dry weather, drought, severe drought and recovering from drought. If autumn and winter do not produce substantial heavy rain, ministers have been warned, in a briefing seen by the <em>Observer</em>, then the south-east could reach severe drought early next year, necessitating far greater restrictions on water use.</p> <p>River flows are now lower than those seen in 2012, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/20/drought-declared-south-east-england\" title=\"\">drought was declared in February after a dry winter</a>, and London<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/24/hosepipe-bans-uk-drought\" title=\"\"> came close to severe water shortages</a> just months ahead of the Olympics.

Water companies will do all they can to avoid<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/10/oxfordshire-village-living-without-running-water\" title=\"\"> rationing or standpipes</a>, but farmers can expect less favourable treatment. “The environment, farming and everything else just goes out of the window when compared with public health, and the need to keep people’s water supplies running,” he said.</p> <p>Ministers were briefed this week that farmers – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/12/mass-crop-failures-expected-in-england-as-farmers-demand-hosepipe-bans\" title=\"\">facing the ruin of up to half their crops</a> – have in effect only one month’s water left, as abstraction levels are now as high as they would normally be in November, the <em>Observer</em> can reveal. Conservation groups have also warned some rivers are reaching “the point of no return” as they dry up into stagnant pools.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/12/drought-declared-england-hosepipe-ban-water-restrictions\" title=\"\">Drought was officially declared</a> on Friday in eight out of the 14 areas of England, with more under review, after a meeting on Friday of the National Drought Group, made up of the Environment Agency and other officials, water companies, the water regulatory Ofwat, farming leaders and conservation groups. Thunderstorms expected from Sunday will do little to alleviate the dry conditions, as rain runs off dry and compacted soil, and flash flooding is possible.</p> <p>Five water firms have announced hosepipe bans so far, but farmers have called for more.

If we get below average rainfall in autumn and winter, we would be in a very serious situation by spring.” He added: “If this weather persists, we will need a winter far wetter than average to recover.”</p> <p>Stuart Singleton-White, from the Angling Trust, said: “You look at those graphs from the meeting, even if we get the rain somewhere near average, if we get river levels assuming 80 per cent or 60 per cent of long term average rainfall in the next couple of months, then we may avoid [severe drought], but the confidence level of even getting to 60 per cent is low.</p> <p>“Even if we get the rain, it will not get into our rivers and our aquifers because it will be used to rewet the very dry soil. Unless we get significant rain for a very long time we are going to have an extended drought well into next year and potentially a severe drought.”</p> <p>Experts said England was in a better position to withstand drought than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/may/22/drought-difficult-word?CMP=gu_com\" title=\"\">in 2012</a>, when a series of dry winters from 2009-10 had seriously depleted groundwater sources, leading to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/19/england-wildlife-drought\" title=\"\">unusual declaration of a spring drought that year</a>. By contrast, good rainfall levels in late 2021 and early this year recharged groundwater sources, which are falling but not yet at critical levels.</p> <p>Chisholm said: “This drought has come very quickly. More often we have seen drought after a dry winter, but this year all resources were really well topped up. We have gone really rapidly from an OK situation to breaking records for drought.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 14 August 2022.

The reason is obvious and simple: it is mind-bendingly expensive and complex to get people and equipment to a planet 140 million miles from Earth. The artists <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdXqpiPvvRo\">Ella Good and Nicki Kent</a> are, however, undeterred. On a Bristol wharf, <a href=\"https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/m-shed/whats-on/building-a-martian-house/\">next to the M Shed museum</a> of the city’s history, they have installed what they call a “people’s version of living on Mars”, a “prototype Martian house” built to a budget of £50,000, with an additional £20,000 spent on workshops, plus support in kind from a number of construction companies. Their expenditure is about enough, at a guess, to pay for the toothbrushes on a typical real-life space programme.</p> <p>Their two-level structure looks like a shiny gold bug – a woodlouse? a tardigrade? – perched on a shipping container. It stands small but conspicuous among the masts and rigging of heritage shipping, and the culture and retail buildings and preserved cranes of a former industrial zone. It represents one unit, designed for two astronauts, of an imaginary community that could be built on the planet, where 50 people might stay for months and more. The idea is to provide a “lens” on life on Earth, by exploring how to survive in a place of scarcity and danger.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The concept of the least amount of space in which people can decently live is taken to a new level of tininess</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is an element of realism. The artists asked Hugh Broughton, an architect best known for <a href=\"https://hbarchitects.co.uk/halley-vi-british-antarctic-research-station/\">designing Antarctic research stations</a>, to design the structure, on the basis that he has worked in the most Mars-like places, in terms of environmental hostility, on Earth. Working with Owen Pearce, an architect formerly employed in his office, who has now set up a practice called <a href=\"https://pearce-plus.com/projects/martianhouse\">Pearce+</a>, Broughton has come up with techniques that, although untested, have some practical plausibility.</p> <p>The bug is a lightweight structure of gold-coated foil, to be shipped from Earth, which would be filled on site with the Martian rubble known as regolith. Habitable space below it would be made by exploiting the lava tubes that are believed to lie beneath the planet’s surface, and by re-using components of the spacecraft that would carry humans to their new home. By these means resources would be used as efficiently as possible. Residents would be protected by the mass of material above them from the cosmic rays that are among the worst hazards on Mars.</p> <p>Good and Kent developed their ideas by visiting the <a href=\"http://mdrs.marssociety.org/\">Mars Desert Research Station i</a>n the Utah desert, which simulates missions to the planet, and by consulting a spacecraft systems engineer and an Earth and planetary scientist at the University of Bristol. Ultimately, their interest is less technical than human. What do you need to live well, they want to ask, in conditions of isolation? What would you have for breakfast? How would you cope with the fact that it takes up to 20 minutes for a message sent from Mars to reach Earth, and the same again for the reply to come back again? Or that you have to fix something yourself if it breaks, using whatever is available?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b12c65f771676ff5c33feaf228f2c0adcf9250e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b12c65f771676ff5c33feaf228f2c0adcf9250e2/0_0_7645_5311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A concept sketch for Building a Martian House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sketch for Building a Martian House. © Hugh Broughton Architects and Pearce+</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Hugh Broughton Architects and Pearce+</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So they ran education workshops and will hold more inside their Martian house. Ultimately, say Good and Kent, they want to offer “a hopeful vision”. They want to show what is possible where high levels of resourcefulness are required, and how even in extreme circumstances it might be possible to think beyond mere survival. Whatever discoveries may arise are likely to be more relevant to an environmentally challenged Earth than the red planet, especially as participants in the workshops are unlikely ever to get to the latter.</p> <p>The interior of the structure provides the backdrop for this work. As Broughton’s Antarctic projects are also concerned with wellbeing and mental health in challenging circumstances, he and Pearce can bring this expertise to bear on the Mars/Bristol endeavour. It comes with features designed to cheer up or at least distract its dwellers, and to put them in touch with nature: a window on to the dusty landscape (or, in this instance, office buildings and a cathedral tower); a double-layered roof light that contains some of the unit’s water supply in its thickness, such that it would freeze and unfreeze with the local weather conditions. (Mostly the former, given that the average temperature is minus 60C, the maximum 20C.) Hydroponically grown plants, helpful for survival and sanity, surround the putative astronauts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6605b5920cef10969e2e11528d377e55ff55f3e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6605b5920cef10969e2e11528d377e55ff55f3e3/0_0_2592_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artists Ella Good and Nicki Kent in astronaut suits at the Mars Desert Research Station, Utah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artists Ella Good and Nicki Kent in astronaut suits at the Mars Desert Research Station, Utah. © Satori Photos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Satori Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time you get a sense of the extremely limited dimensions available to space travellers.

There was a concept in 1920s German architecture called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/oct/21/architecture\">existenzminimum</a>, which described the least amount of space in which people could decently live; interplanetary travel takes this idea to a new level of tininess.</p> <p>There’s part of me that would like this project to be a bit less speculative, that it would show more precisely what might be built on Mars if humans ever got to live there. The Nasa-backed <a href=\"https://www.hi-seas.org/\">Hi-Seas project</a> in Hawaii has been pursuing this subject with substantial resources and expertise for a decade, as did the European, Russian and Chinese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2011/nov/04/mars-mission-simulation-in-pictures\">Mars500</a>, from 2007 to 2011.

She talks about optimism, collective responsibility and finishing her A-levels","byline":"Alex Moshakis","body":"<p>A few years ago, the environmentalist Bella Lack travelled to Versova Beach, on the Mumbai coast, to stand on a huge heap of rubbish. Lack was 16 at the time and studying for her A-levels; she was also writing a book, <em>The Children of the Anthropocene</em>, in which she tells the stories of young people involved in projects that address the climate crisis. She was in Mumbai to meet Afroz Shah, a lawyer who had taken it upon himself to clean thousands of tonnes of washed-up plastic from the beach. Shah had begun the project with no funding and no official support – only his 84-year-old neighbour had offered to help; to Lack, the task seemed impossible. “The problem facing us felt so big and insurmountable,” she wrote later, thinking of the beach but also of climate activism more broadly, “that I wondered whether I should stop with all the campaigning, the speeches, and just enjoy my teenage years while they lasted.”</p> <p>Recalling the moment now, Lack shrugs. “It’s that recognition of the scale of the problem that makes you think: ‘But what can <em>I</em> do?’” she says. We’re walking together through Richmond Park, south-west London, on one of those unforgivingly hot days in July. Lack arrived by bike – she grew up and still lives nearby – but without a lock, so for a while we wander around looking for a bush big enough to hide her ride. “You can imagine the stench,” she goes on, of the beach. “Plastic as far as you can see. Plastic that stretches out beyond the beach and into the water. Plastic that becomes islands of waste. I just thought: ‘Most of this isn’t even <em>from</em> here.’”</p> <p>To write <em>The Children of the Anthropocene</em>, Lack met or spoke virtually to a diverse group of young people all over the world. There were the Indonesian sisters who went on hunger strike to convince the governor of Bali to ban plastic bags from the island. A boy in Los Angeles organising communities against air pollution. The lawyer, Shah, who gradually convinced locals to clean cooperatively, so that now the project is as good as finished and the beach is cleaner if not immaculate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38ad461d8c6ce535835b941ab6dc3febefb1fa9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38ad461d8c6ce535835b941ab6dc3febefb1fa9e/0_271_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Making a stand: protesting again against the intended resumption of whaling by Japan in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making a stand: protesting again against the intended resumption of whaling by Japan in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Bell/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lack, who is an ambassador for the <a href=\"https://www.janegoodall.org/\" title=\"\">Jane Goodall Institute </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.bornfree.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Born Free Foundation</a>, and who has only just finished her exams, believes that sharing personal stories of climate activism will “catalyse action more than telling people, like, ‘We have 12 years left to stop catastrophe,’ or, ‘A million species are in danger of extinction’” – abstract concepts that often feel personally unrelatable. By explaining the efforts of young people who, by a coincidence of geography, have been forced into some kind of climate action, she hopes to give those of us not yet in everyday crisis a jolt. “That’s the idea of the book,” she says. “To try to get people to engage emotionally with what’s happening.” When we’re told the stories of teenagers facing and overcoming environmental peril, aren’t we more likely to wake up to the problem?</p> <p><em><strong>Lack woke up </strong></em>to the problem as a 12-year-old, when she saw a documentary about the damage palm oil concessions have on orangutan habitats. “It was the most intense obsession,” she recalls. “I had posters of them” – the orangutans – “all over my room.” Soon, Lack railed at school against deforestation, and she fell into campaigning; by 15 she was attending protests. Neither of Lack’s parents have backgrounds in environmental activism. She discovered most of what she learned – “how deforestation links to emissions, and to the climate crisis, and how that links to other social issues; it was kind of like a snowball effect” – through social media, and during visits to her uncle’s farm, in Worcestershire, where she spent lambing seasons and could walk freely through surrounding woodland.</p> <p>“The most frequent question I get asked is about my parents,” she says. We have drifted through tall ferns towards a bum-worn bench overlooking a pond. “‘Have they <em>forced</em> you to do this?’ ‘Have they <em>indoctrinated</em> you?’” She shakes her head. “It’s kind of the other way around. If my parents had forced me to do this for seven years, I probably wouldn’t be doing it. Kids are stubborn.”</p> <p>“You’ve indoctrinated them?” I ask.</p> <p>She nods.</p> <p>I say, “How so?”</p> <p>“By sending them drafts of my book,” she says. “They used to come to protests, when I was much younger and mostly doing protests. There are lots of photos of me, my mum in the background looking absolutely miserable.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dbed57dccc775c092c66967c2fd5d5d4f59e9fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dbed57dccc775c092c66967c2fd5d5d4f59e9fc/0_2_4642_5798/801.jpg\" alt=\"Bella Lack for The Observer Magaazine\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘What we’re <em>really</em> protecting is humanity. And you’ve got to enjoy it while you’re here’: Bella Lack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Peters/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lack describes this process as a kind of “trickle-up activism ”, where young people introduce their elders to new information and slowly, if arduously, convince them to alter lifelong habits. Lack’s mother’s behaviour has changed “in small, personal ways”, Lack says. “Like, in the house, we don’t really eat meat.” (Lack has two older siblings: a sister who is close to becoming vegetarian and a brother who still eats ham straight out of the packet – you can’t win them all.) “When I was doing activism most intensely, at the age of 15, 16, I don’t think I ever went out,” she continues. “I was so immensely overwhelmed, it was all I could focus on.” For a while, she felt a deep responsibility to both help the world and help others help the world. “I got to a point of burnout, I think,” she recalls. “I was thinking, ‘I’m not going to be able to do this much longer. I’ve done my bit.’” Part of the message of Lack’s book is this: change your behaviours, but live your life. “We’re protecting the planet,” she says. “But the planet will be fine. What we’re <em>really</em> protecting is humanity. And, you know, you’ve got to enjoy it while you’re here.”</p> <p><em><strong>For a while at school, </strong></em>Lack didn’t tell her friends about her interest in activism, for fear of alienation. “I thought when they found out they’d think it was so strange,” she says. (Her first Twitter handle, a pseudonym, was purposefully obscure.) Now most of her friends are educated in key climate issues, and they share and discuss new information when it drops. Still, Lack struggles with the “activist” label. “There’s a stigma,” she says. “What did Boris Johnson call them? ‘Tree-hugging, mung bean-munching eco freaks?’” She tuts. “That’s the thing about activism. It’s seen as railing against the system. Constantly castigating what’s happening.” She thrusts her hand into the air as if angrily wielding a placard. “What if it were about imagining what a different future might look like? And moving towards something better?” Car-free streets. Cleaner city air. Wild spaces in urban areas. To Lack, the fun and excitement of activism lies in developing solutions for a more positive future. “I think we need to redefine the word,” she says. This will encourage young people to “find their own way” and free them of any anxiety associated with existing labels.</p> <p>Partway through our conversation, I tell Lack that my son, who is six, recently wrote a story (title: <em>Max and Tommy and the Flaming Sun</em>), and that it dawned on me it was a piece of climate-apocalypse fiction, and that he is likely to be listening in to furtive conversations my wife and I are having about our collective future.</p> <p>“The sun burns their clothes off,” I say.</p> <p>Lack looks briefly concerned and gazes out at the pond, beyond which we can see the far-off roofs of several central London office blocks.</p> <p>“How does it end?” she says.</p> <p>“With Max and Tommy eating a nice dinner,” I say.</p> <p>“So he’s an optimist, then.”</p> <p>Lack is an optimist, too. When I ask how she’s able to retain hope for the future, she gives the shrug all young climate activists give when people older than them ask inane questions, and says, “What’s the alternative? To give up?”</p> <p>She goes on: “That’s how we see the climate crisis: a problem to be solved by a few passionate people who care about the environment. It’s fascinating when people call activism a passion. It’s absolutely <em>not</em> a passion. I didn’t <em>ever</em> really enjoy the protest side of it. The many people who recognise the need to make change, it’s not through passion, it’s not a ‘passion project’, it’s a responsibility. That’s what I’m trying to convey: how diverse the people affected by this are, and therefore how diverse the people taking action need to be.</p> <p>“But that’s the whole thing about redefining activism,” she continues. “It needs to be integrated into many careers and the work of many people. If you’re a lawyer, focus on the eco side. If you’re a chef, curb the impact of the food you’re using.”</p> <p>I tell her that I recently spoke with a winemaker who had stopped cardboard from entering his premises.</p> <p>“I see that as activism,” she says. “Making change within your own business towards achieving sustainability. Do you really need to be travelling across the world? Can’t you make video calls?”</p> <p>Several current environmental campaigns focus on the lack of climate-crisis education offered in the school curriculum; when school leavers enter the workforce, they aren’t equipped with the knowledge and ideas necessary to work sustainably. Lack studied geography at A-level. When I ask if she was taught about the climate crisis, she says, “There was a section about it.” We both look down at the floor, at a loss. “And not a lot of people do geography,” she adds. “Not enough, anyway. And it’s <em>one</em> segment of the course, and it’s really hard to convey how important this is when it’s just one segment of a course along with all the others.”</p> <p>Through her work, Lack has become friendly with several other young climate activists. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a> wrote the introduction to her book; she often chats with the Irish environmentalist <a href=\"https://daramcanulty.com/\" title=\"\">Dara McAnulty.</a> Both are bestselling authors under 20. When I ask Lack why she thinks it’s incumbent on young people to publish on climate change, she says, a little angrily, “I’m trying to work that out. I don’t know why older people don’t feel this same sense of urgency. I mean, I <em>know</em>. It’s the futures of young people that are more imperilled. But why isn’t that sense of urgency being felt by everyone right now?”</p> <p>“Greed?” I suggest.</p> <p>“Habit, greed, vested interests…” she says. “But I still don’t understand how people would put that above protecting the environment, above protecting future generations. Like, on a superficial level, I get it. But it’s short-termism. People looking at how they might profit in the next month… What’s the point in profit on a dead planet?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f92e96578e39f088f4f95bc62f694e1c40a0c9a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f92e96578e39f088f4f95bc62f694e1c40a0c9a6/0_290_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clear message: addressing the crowd at the Global March for Elephants and Rhinos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clear message: addressing the crowd at the Global March for Elephants and Rhinos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picture Capital/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While we talk, Lack begins to cough, and I notice her voice is croaky. “I’m slightly dying,” she says, in the way you’d imagine a 19-year-old might. She has been celebrating the end of her exams, and her mother has banned her from going out again. “I’m not partying any more,” she says, resolutely. “I’m worn out. I’m a shell. But it’s weird doing things like this” – a newspaper interview to promote her book – “and then going to parties. It’s a bit of a double lifestyle. And I think many young people are living this kind of double life, trying to protect the future while also just enjoying being young.”</p> <p>Most of Lack’s friends feel the same. “I think it comes from the recognition that our future… This is the planet we’re inheriting,” she goes on. “And we’re being given a poisoned chalice, and it’s our responsibility to change that. A few days ago my uncle said to me, ‘My generation is done. It’s up to you now.’ And I think that’s so damaging. He’s only in his 50s.” Turning to me sharply, she says, “I’m sure you feel responsibility to your kids, to leave them a planet that is the same or better than the one you’ve lived in.”</p> <p>I say, “Yes,” not without shame, for sometimes I, too, eat ham straight out of the packet.</p> <p>Then I say, “Do you get fed up with being asked how to change the world?”</p> <p>She sighs.</p> <p>“Not really. I put myself in a position where I’m expected to give those answers. Sometimes it hits me – it’s the weirdest thing. Why are people asking <em>me</em>? I’m a bit of a messenger in a way. Lots of the things I’m repeating, they’re things I’ve heard from scientists. I think that’s OK. You don’t have to have the label scientist to speak out.”</p> <p>Sometimes, though, Lack experiences a kind of impostor syndrome. “I’m affected by the environmental crisis in an emotional, forward-looking way,” she says, “rather than in some direct, current way. People don’t want to hear a story about when I watched a video about orangutans and palm oil.” They want to be catalysed to action by hearing from young people who have already been affected, she says. “<em>That’s</em> going to make the change.” And off we walk to find her bike.</p> <p><em>The Children of the Anthropocene by Bella Lack (Penguin, £9.99) is available from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-children-of-the-anthropocene-9780241501085\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a> for £9.29</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/14/blind-ambition-review-inspiring-documentary-on-first-zimbabwean-wine-tasting-team","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Blind Ambition review – inspiring documentary on first Zimbabwean wine-tasting team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/14/blind-ambition-review-inspiring-documentary-on-first-zimbabwean-wine-tasting-team","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/14/blind-ambition-review-inspiring-documentary-on-first-zimbabwean-wine-tasting-team","fields":{"headline":"Blind Ambition review – inspiring documentary on first Zimbabwean wine-tasting team","trailText":"This affectionate film follows the journey of four migrants from Zimbabwe who go on to become some of South Africa’s top sommeliers","byline":"Wendy Ide","body":"<p>Four refugees who left Zimbabwe for South Africa separately discovered wine and subsequently formed a friendship.

It’s a shame millennials like me can’t afford the privilege","byline":"Marie Le Conte","body":"<p>My first time at the Groucho was perfect, in that I remember little of it. I was 19, friends of friends of friends whisked me through Soho during fashion week, and somehow we ended up there. My only memory is of trying to smoothly, seductively walk past Mark Ronson, tripping and nearly headbutting him instead.</p> <p>Some years later, my old boss got me in to watch the results of the EU referendum. Screens had been put in the bar but the room itself hadn’t been closed off from the usual patrons. For as long as I live, I will picture some gruff hack pushing a gaggle of giggly teenage models out of the way while bellowing: “Move! Sunderland’s about to declare.”</p> <p>In short: I have had good and bad nights at the Groucho. Not that I’ve ever been a member; always the questionable guest and never the paying member, as the saying doesn’t quite go. Still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/11/home-for-hell-raisers-new-owners-of-groucho-club-seek-young-blood\" title=\"\">news that the club had changed hands</a> and now wanted to attract a younger clientele felt eyebrow-raising.</p> <p>It is hardly the first club to realise it needs freshening up. Soho House now offers cheap memberships with all manners of perks for people under 27, and a friend once managed to convince one of the stuffier establishments to let him join for free, on account of him being under 50.</p> <p>The aim is a noble one; the once-new wave of members’ clubs prided itself on being fresh, exciting and unpredictable, and remaining so means bringing in new blood. Given what went on in those bars in the 90s, it seems fair to say that the now middle-aged hellraisers deserve a well-earned break.</p> <p>What isn’t clear, however, is whether there really is a new generation dying to replace them. For a start – and to state the obvious – club memberships aren’t cheap. Even reduced rates are, for the most part, more than £40 a month, and that only gets you through the door.</p> <p>Once in, people can expect to pay similar prices to midmarket establishments, meaning around £8 for a glass of house wine and £18 for one of the cheaper main courses. At risk of appointing myself as the voice of my generation, I doubt that many people born after 1990 can currently afford this with ease.</p> <p>We are headed towards tough economic times and, unless you are both very successful and in an especially stable job, spending this much for no obvious reason may just seem too frivolous. It is also worth wondering if it still feels like a worthy investment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Clubs probably were the ideal place in which to sneak in boozy lunches once upon a time – but the mood has changed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>People in the creative industries have long relied on informal networking to boost their careers but there are many other ways to meet relevant people. Clubs probably were the ideal place in which to sneak in boozy lunches once upon a time – but the mood has changed.</p> <p>Last time I rocked up at 6pm in a Soho club, there were few alcoholic drinks in sight, and everyone seemed sober enough. In fact, the waitress did get cross at several customers but only because they were refusing to shut their laptops and stop working. Dionysiac, it was not.</p> <p>Some places have embraced the heel turn; just before the pandemic, Soho House launched Soho Works, a new chain of co-working spaces mostly aimed at its pre-existing club members. The days of fighting, snorting and snogging feel like they belong to a different world.</p> <p>It is a shame – I was more concerned with crayons than cocktails in the 90s, but the heyday of members’ clubs did seem exceptionally fun. Perhaps they can reinvent themselves in post-pandemic London. After all, many people are now working from home on the outskirts of the city and would surely welcome a home away from home nestled inside zone 1. </p> <p>In an era of endless concerns about burnout, toxic online cultures and tech generally ruining our mental health, places where smartphones are frowned on would surely be welcome.</p> <p>The only problem, really, remains the cost of membership. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/inflation-will-soar-to-astronomical-levels-over-next-year-thinktank-warns\" title=\"\">With inflation mooted to hit 12%</a>, any attempt to bring in fresh faces must realise that few interesting types currently have millions to spare.

The price of <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPU083\">lumber products</a> has dropped significantly from their highs last year.<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/business/us-oil-prices.html\"> Oil prices</a> are down 30% from earlier this summer.</p> <p>This is partly because the world’s supply chain is beginning to show signs of normalcy (port traffic in Long Beach, California, is down to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MXSOCAL/status/1556794629160177664\">84 ships</a> off the coast, significantly less than during the pandemic, mass lockdowns in China have ended and the Baltic Dry Index, a key measure of freight costs and shipping demand, <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/baltic\">has fallen</a> almost 30% since the beginning of the year). There’s also been a general slowdown in the world’s demand for goods which, while not great, has certainly affected prices.</p> <p>It’s doubtful whether the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act – regardless of the positive impact it should have on our climate and healthcare problems – will have much impact on inflation. Penn’s <a href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2022/7/29/inflation-reduction-act-preliminary-estimates\">Wharton School</a> says that the bill would actually increase inflation until 2024 and has “low confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation”. But the good news is that government spending has significantly decreased and the Fed is no longer pouring fuel on the fire.</p> <p>This brings me to the bad news: we are still struggling with rising costs and the situation isn’t going to change any time in the near future. Producer prices – at 11.3% as of June – are still up well over historical levels and, because the Producer Price Index is considered a leading indicator, that means that ultimately consumer prices will remain at elevated levels for months to come. It took a year and half for inflation to reach these levels (consumer prices began rising in March 2021 and hit 7% by the end of 2021, well before Russia invaded Ukraine). It’s going to take at least that long for it – hopefully – to return to the more sustainable levels we’ve seen in the past. It may take even longer.</p> <p>That’s because there are lots of obstacles in the way of significantly taming inflation. Some economists, notably former treasury secretary Larry Summers, believe the Fed’s moves aren’t aggressive enough.</p> <p>Further pressure from the Ukraine war could elevate energy and food prices, particularly as we head into the winter months. More Covid cases in China could once again disrupt the supply chain. Even if the world economy begins to grow significantly again in the near future, that growth could put strains on our fragile supply chains and disrupt pricing for many of the core materials we buy.</p> <p>So what to do if you’re a small business? You leverage your accounting and customer relationship management systems to stay on top of your product lines, customer profits and margins. You raise prices discriminately and carefully. You communicate frequently with your customers and you expand your relationship with your suppliers. You constantly hunt for other sources of supply. You try to lock in long-term contracts and, like so many big brands, practice “shrink-flation”, where you charge the same price for a little less product. You keep your inventories under control, your overhead low and your cash balances as high as possible.</p> <p>You do all of this because, even though it has probably peaked, inflation isn’t going away any time soon. It’s no longer 2012, when rates hovered around 2%. It’s 2022, and you can expect the prices of your core materials to remain significantly elevated for at least the next six to 12 months. My best clients are always planning ahead. So plan for that.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/14/all-of-us-dorfman-national-theatre-francesca-martinez-review-jarman-kings-head-mark-farrelly-derek-jarman","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T09:30:05Z","webTitle":"The week in theatre: All of Us; Jarman – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/all-of-us-dorfman-national-theatre-francesca-martinez-review-jarman-kings-head-mark-farrelly-derek-jarman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/14/all-of-us-dorfman-national-theatre-francesca-martinez-review-jarman-kings-head-mark-farrelly-derek-jarman","fields":{"headline":"The week in theatre: All of Us; Jarman – review","trailText":"Disablism, austerity and therapy-speak fuel Francesca Martinez’s jolting drama, while Mark Farrelly channels Derek Jarman in a rush of memories","byline":"Susannah Clapp","body":"<p>There are startling, sparkling episodes in <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/all-of-us?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrs2XBhDjARIsAHVymmS70iWrX6EM-K3sDBIPRBLVI7hG9R7fmi8pcjqcb_nEaK9sBTW8fRQaAjAKEALw_wcB\">All of Us</a></strong>, revelatory moments when you hear and see experiences new to the stage of the National, which is working hard to expand the repertoire of the lives it projects. You would expect this from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/28/francesca-martinez-all-of-us-standup-comedy\">Francesca Martinez</a>, the writer and standup who describes her cerebral palsy as being “wobbly”. You would expect it from director Ian Rickson, who brings his minute focus to the action: under Anna Watson’s quiet lighting the stage spins around between scenes; the movement is slow but it is pushed by rage. What a pity that the rough edges of surprise and sharp ironies are muffled by explanation.</p> <p>Martinez, calmly humorous, plays a therapist, good at saving patients from themselves, bad at getting angry on her own behalf. Her “wobbliness” means she can’t do buttons or shake Shreddies into a bowl. But though she often shuffles on her knees, she can walk a little and so is assessed as too fit to merit the car on which she relies. As her angrier, spliff-smoking friend, Francesca Mills tries to goad her into action as she firecrackers around in a wheelchair: “Spit it out. I know you don’t swallow.” This 21-year-old commands two of the most highly charged scenes: a sinuous seduction, and a different sort of going to bed, when her mates ease her into a nappy for the 10 hours when a carer can’t visit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tom Lishman’s sound design turns a tiny stage into a lifetime of big dreams.

A play that sets out rightly to challenge the idea of normality, justly to take on government negligence, weakens its accomplishments by turning drama into dilemma.</p> <p>At the King’s Head, along with <em><a href=\"https://kingsheadtheatre.com/whats-on/quentin-crisp-naked-hope\">Naked Hope</a></em>, a monologue about Quentin Crisp, writer and producer Mark Farrelly is delivering <strong><a href=\"https://kingsheadtheatre.com/whats-on/jarman\">Jarman</a>, </strong>a torrential hour and 20 minutes of Derek Jarman: not really an impersonation – though Farrelly has a look of the film-maker when sporting boiler suit, beanie and jutting jaw – but a rush of moments and memories. The boy Jarman being jeered at – and thwacked – at home and school. The young artist designing for John Gielgud and living it up at Bankside; preening in a white sheet to become Miss Crêpe Suzette for Alternative Miss World; simpering under a wimple made of scrunched-up brown paper as “Sister Ejaculata”; stunned by his HIV diagnosis; glorying in – the simplest sentences are the best – the marine colours, the silver, ochre and lime green, at the defiantly named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/21/derek-jarman-prospect-cottage-dungeness-kent-garden-museum-london\">Prospect Cottage</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f2618e3277178c7a15c23e1ff6528e14730dab2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f2618e3277178c7a15c23e1ff6528e14730dab2/0_42_4845_2907/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Farrelly in Jarman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The declarations pelt down’: Mark Farrelly in Jarman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Bush</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The declarations pelt down provocatively: is decadence really “the first sign of intelligence”? Sarah-Louise Young’s production is fizzing and overripe. Farrelly’s performance is dextrously expanded by Tom Lishman’s sound design, which on a meltingly hot evening turned a tiny stage into a lifetime of big dreams. The crash of the sea, the glug of champagne, the sighing of strings.

While on paper the pay is well above Spain’s minimum wage, the interpreters point out they are expected to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. </p> <p>“The salary that has been offered comes down to less than €2.50 per hour, considering the 24/7 work week,” the petition says. At least two other people were offered similar rates, according to screenshots seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>SeproTec rejected the allegations as “flagrantly biased”, saying its salaries were between five and eight times greater than what the petition said.</p> <p>Interpreters can never be more than a 30-minute distance from their work base and may have to work up to 12 hours at a time, often dealing with traumatised people who have endured terrifying sea crossings.</p> <p>Moctar was previously paid more than twice as much by another agency working for Frontex, with a package that included his accommodation and transport.</p> <p>Not including these benefits is unreasonable, argue the petitioners. Frontex interpreters are deployed for a few months at a time to tourist hotspots where short-term accommodation is expensive. “We request a reasonable salary per month plus the expenses for accommodation, transportation and flights,” states the petition, which had been signed by 182 people on 12 August.</p> <p>One signatory, who said he worked for Frontex for many years, via another contractor, said he was not prepared to “compromise my skills in interpreting and culture mediating” for low pay.</p> <p>The row comes months after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/head-of-eu-border-agency-frontex-resigns-amid-criticisms-fabrice-leggeri\">departure of Frontex’s executive director</a> after an investigation by the EU’s anti-fraud agency, amid longstanding allegations of collusion by Frontex in illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers.</p> <p>Every year the border agency draws on the skills of 80 interpreters and cultural mediators employed through third-party contractors. It describes their work as “crucial for the functioning of our operations”.</p> <p>The Warsaw-based agency said it valued the professionalism of interpreters and cultural mediators, people who can understand dialects, accents, culture and customs of a region. “They are present during interviews with migrants coming to Europe and greatly facilitate the registration and identification procedures.”</p> <p>The job can be stressful, with a mental toll exacted from recounting traumatic stories in the first person. “You can have an interview with a girl who said that ‘they raped me when I was with my mum’, or ‘they raped my mother’; so you cannot interpret it as like ‘the applicant says they raped my mother’, you will just interpret ‘my mother’,” Moctar said. “I think for interpreters, this psychological pressure makes you sad.”</p> <p>After Moctar appealed to the Frontex acting director, Aija Kalnaja, to “take immediate action, by proposing acceptable working conditions and salaries”, the agency declined to get involved, suggesting he contact Spanish labour market authorities.</p> <p>In a letter to Moctar, Frontex said it had no legal responsibility for staff employed by contractors, noting these organisations were bound by EU and international law. “The resources, including interpreters and cultural mediators which the contractor provides for the purpose of the implementation of this [contract] are not considered in any way Frontex statutory staff,” the agency said, quoting the contract.</p> <p>Responding to questions from the Guardian, Frontex made a similar point, adding: “We have read the petition from the interpreters and cultural mediators with great concern. We would like to underline that Frontex does not accept unethical or illegal working conditions.</p> <p>“We have contacted the provider reminding them about their obligations and stressing that Frontex will monitor the implementation of the contract and whether all the conditions for the workers are respected.”</p> <p>It added: “We have also preserved the right to terminate the contract in case of irregularities, fraud or breach of contractual obligations.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for SeproTec said: “We consider the information provided in the petition as flagrantly biased [and] intentionally done to damage our brand.”</p> <p>They claimed salaries were “way above” what the petition stated: “The equivalent per hour would be at least five times over the €2.50 mentioned in the petition and in some countries up to eight times above.”</p> <p>SeproTec added that its records of service provided to Frontex showed cultural mediators worked on average 32 hours per week, with less than 5% of the time outside normal working hours. It said it paid allowances to fully or partially cover the cost of accommodation in the “isolated cases” when it was necessary to move staff to another country. “The company has a strict policy of compliance with the applicable legal framework,” it added.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/14/finally-we-are-together-partitions-broken-families-reunite-after-seven-decades","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T09:01:10Z","webTitle":"‘Finally we are together’: partition’s broken families reunite after seven decades","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/14/finally-we-are-together-partitions-broken-families-reunite-after-seven-decades","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/14/finally-we-are-together-partitions-broken-families-reunite-after-seven-decades","fields":{"headline":"‘Finally we are together’: partition’s broken families reunite after seven decades","trailText":"Social media is helping long-lost relatives discover each other after a lifetime separated by the India-Pakistan border","byline":"Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Aakash Hassan","body":"<p>It was an embrace that held 74 years of pain and longing.

It was to be a bloody and bitter partition. After 300 years of official British presence, the key figures of Indian independence, Mahatma Gandhi and his protege and future prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, envisaged a single, secular country. Muslim political leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah, however, argued for a separate state for Muslims, fearful of the implications of a Hindu-majority India.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/india-partition_borders/giv-6562pEjusyaVLaaG/\" data-alt=\"India partition map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/india-partition_borders/giv-6562pEjusyaVLaaG/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>As religious tensions were stoked, deadly riots broke out, targeting Hindus, then Muslims and then Sikhs.

He has not yet been able to visit it either; last year India rejected his visa application.</p> <p>It was thanks to Dhillon’s channel that the Khan brothers found each other again. Sikka, who was born to a Muslim family in what is now Indian Punjab, was just six months old when partition violence broke out. Away from home with his mother, they were forced to take shelter with a local Sikh family who were protecting their Muslim neighbours from the massacres.</p> <p>After weeks of carnage, they emerged, but to terrible scenes. The nearby river was so filled with bodies it ran red with blood. And in Sikka’s home village of Jagraon 40 miles away, there were no Muslims left; no trace of Sikka’s father, his 10-year-old brother or eight-year-old sister. Sikka’s mother, consumed with grief, drowned herself. Sikka was left with no family except a penniless uncle, and was raised by a Sikh family from his mother’s village.</p> <p>He spent his whole adult life trying to find news of his family, particularly his beloved brother Sadiq. He made speculative calls and wrote hundreds of letters to vague addresses in Pakistan, to no avail. He never married; without family around him, he said, “something was always missing so it never felt right”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1642a411645b2eff5b13cfeacbc304f4f3b8faa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1642a411645b2eff5b13cfeacbc304f4f3b8faa9/0_0_6953_4635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sikka Khan on his phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sikka Khan (centre) talks to his elder brother Sadiq in Pakistan on a mobile phone video call.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was by chance in 2019 that a friend from the village was sent a YouTube video from Punjabi Lehar by a relative.

After Dhillon was contacted, it was confirmed: this man was Sadiq Khan.</p> <p>An emotional video call was arranged between the two brothers, and soon they were speaking to each other every day. Sikka finally learned the story of his family; that his father had been murdered in a communal attack and his brother and sister had fled to a border refugee camp where his sister had died from illness. Sadiq made it to Pakistan, settled in Faisalabad and had six children and several grandchildren, but never a day went by when he did not think of his lost brother.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/06/75-years-india-partition-britain-generations-india-pakistan\">After 75 years, the hidden memories of India’s partition are rising up through Britain’s generations | Kavita Puri</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The brothers were prevented from meeting for almost three years thanks to visa issues and the Covid pandemic, but in January, a reunion was finally arranged at the Kartarpur corridor, a place of religious pilgrimage recently opened to Indians and Pakistanis. “I felt complete,” Sikka said of the encounter.

And the Tories are doing this either through ignorance, a simple failure to understand that the arts have a value beyond the monetary or as a deliberate attempt to silence people who can see through the all-pervading language of lies that is thieves’ cant of the current Conservative party and its client media. Maybe looking for a motive is to dignify the current Conservative crop with an intelligence it just doesn’t have. Worms are chopped by the plough, but the plough means them no harm. Brexit Britain is that plough. Artists are those worms. And Nadine Dorries is a woman crouching at the side of the field, watching the plough, while doing a massive shit in the nest of a rare bird.</p> <p>It is never too often to remind everyone that when he was culture secretary, spivvy Sajid Javid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/08/secondary-ticketing-legal-but-not-morally-right-sajid-javid\">indefensibly encouraged ticket touts</a>, whom he viewed as legitimate entrepreneurs annoying the chattering middle classes, to profiteer from reselling publicly subsidised tickets at higher rates, defeating the whole point of trying to make the arts accessible. And Javid’s eventual successor, Oliver Dowden, declared his love for “commercial theatre”, becoming the first culture secretary to define a genre of art simply by its ability to make money rather than by its composition in relation to style, form and content, as had previously been standard. Personally, I like commercial flowers, such as roses and geraniums for example, as wild flowers disgust me, lolling around in the laybys of rural B-roads like Gypsies. However, in the post-Dorries days, we look back at these two culture compost bags as moral and intellectual titans of taste. We never had it so good!</p> <p>The arts must survive! I am in the middle of my second week at the Edinburgh fringe. I have seen a man dance with pandas on his hands as cornflakes tumble from his mouth; I have seen a young woman embody the opinions of Kirstie Allsopp in the form of an interpretive dance; I have seen a tiny man hold the attention of hundreds of transfixed passersby by hitting a plastic bucket repeatedly with whatever he could pick up off the pavement; and I have seen a delightful dame sing delicately about dogging at a well-tuned piano, as Cicero would have done, had he been an “Alternative Comedian”. I realise, for many critics, I am not making a cast- iron case for the arts. But suddenly the very act of getting on a stage, paying to see someone get on a stage, or just buying a good book and reading it, seems as subversive as plotting to explode Parliament.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is important that we maintain our history and arts, apparently, but only the racist bits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Tories’ cynically manufactured culture war is currently fought so indiscriminately, and on so many simultaneous fronts, that confused culture warriors are in danger of shooting one another’s nads off in the crossfire, even as everything we hold dear gets napalmed to nothing as collateral damage. Liz Truss superglues her anti-woke intestines back together and Rishi Sunak staples his severed penis to his left buttock, as a screaming would-be poet runs out of a burning English literature course covered in smouldering policy announcements, and client journalists and backbench cannon fodder look on, smoking joints dispassionately and listening to Edwin Starr. Culture war? What is it good for? Keeping the cost of living crisis off the front page of the <em>Times</em>, apparently, and allowing Kwasi Kwarteng to waft around the airwaves pronouncing grimly about things that aren’t even really happening. Again.</p> <p>Neither Tory leadership hopeful Rishi Sunak, nor the Thirty-Six Hour Education Secretary Michelle Donelan, The One And A Half Days Queen, wants people to study wasteful arts subjects that don’t give students immediate financial reward. They want to deny a working knowledge of our history and culture to all but a privileged redbrick few. Meanwhile, Dorries has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/cecil-rhodes-nadine-dorries-listed-status-plaque-oxford-college\">given protected status</a> to a small and architecturally undistinguished plaque on an Oxford wall, simply because it commemorates the southern African colonialist Cecil Rhodes. So it is important that we maintain our history and arts after all apparently, but only the racist bits.</p> <p>And on Wednesday morning, the <em>Times</em>, Britain’s second worst newspaper after the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, was opportunistically alarmed that university English literature courses are teaching fewer books and warning students not to read them so they learn less, even though that seems to be precisely what Sunak wants. In its original folkloric form, this now old anti-woke news trope maintained that simple economic cuts to the medieval literature module at Leicester University reflected a woke brigade attempt to remove all evidence of the white, heterosexual, medieval male Geoffrey Chaucer’s genius from university courses in case he offended transgender people. Or something.</p> <p>A two-minute Google showed the <em>Times</em> story to be a product of some fairly substantial spin, perhaps the work of writers lucky enough to have studied fiction at university, with only two books having been actually removed from study nationwide. The modern mania for appending trigger warnings to texts was conflated with the idea of actually removing books. But here in Edinburgh, for example, I could have done with knowing the standup show labelled 12+ contained a lengthy section on masturbating in hospital before taking my 12-year-old in. But come on culture warriors! If you must ruin everything at least display some joined-up thinking! Those of us old enough to remember the 70s recall long-distance car journey windshields splattered with thousands of bugs. There was a background noise of natural abundance all around us that climate change has burned away. The Tories are taking a blow torch to its cultural equivalent just to score points.

I’ve always loved reading. I’m fascinated by narrative and the shape of stories, and how literature can be used to express the breadth and depth of human experiences.</p> <p>None of the above is particularly surprising. I’ve turned writing into a career, fuelled by reading and the intellectual journeys that come in tow. Like you, like everyone, there are many different things that I could have done and a variety of skills that I could have explored. But my bookish tendencies led me on a literary path as I slalomed through school, GCSEs, A-levels, and eventually undergraduate studies in English, at university.</p> <p>And boom, just like that, this whimsical, heartfelt piece of writing has already been derailed by the serious business of “qualifications”; those slips of paper that allow passage from one set of educational checkpoints to another. Look what happened. I started out with a declaration of my love of words and barely a paragraph later, I find myself referencing the big three currencies of formal assessment. Sigh.</p> <p>In a way, this is the great tragedy of modern education – how it gets reduced into pure, cold pragmatism, a series of steps towards gainful employment and financial security. This attitude is codified in a set of new rules proposed by the government, refusing to fund courses if fewer than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/20/ofs-publishes-plans-to-punish-english-universities-for-poor-value-for-money\">60% of students are in professional jobs</a> or studying for a further degree within 15 months of graduating. Already, Sheffield Hallam has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jun/27/sheffield-hallam-university-suspends-low-value-english-literature-degree\">dropped its English literature course</a>, citing low demand, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/29/the-guardian-view-on-arts-and-humanities-under-threat-on-campus\">Cumbria</a> and Roehampton have also announced big cuts to the humanities. Ucas, the universities admissions service, has revealed that the number of acceptances for English studies (including English literature) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jun/27/sheffield-hallam-university-suspends-low-value-english-literature-degree\">has fallen</a> from 9,480 in 2012 to 6,435 in 2021. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak has stated an intention to phase out degrees that don’t “increase earning potential”, revealing a myopic prejudice against subjects that don’t have an immediate monetary value.<strong> </strong>This speaks not only to the declining status of humanities and the arts, but, crucially, to an economic climate in which these disciplines lose value in the first place.</p> <p>I wasn’t thinking about my salary or earning potential when I opted to study literature and write essays. I just knew that literature was a portal to worlds I had never experienced and a way of meeting people I could never meet elsewhere; a way of exploring new thoughts. Even better was what I didn’t realise I was signing up for. Studying English gave me the gift of criticality. I learned to read, really <em>read</em>, for meaning. I learned how to unpick and examine, to contextualise and empathise, to peek into blindspots that I didn’t know I had. I honed the craft of critical thinking, which I took with me into a 15-year career in teaching and continue to lean on as a writer of analytical nonfiction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now more than ever, we need to be encouraging generations to enter the world with curiosity, sensitivity and criticality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now more than ever, we need to be encouraging successive generations to enter the world with curiosity, sensitivity and criticality. The polarised nature of popular politics and swelling tides of historic bigotry show us that we need intimacy with the lived experiences of marginalised groups and awareness of how dominant identities have been constructed, as well as critical distance from the ideologies that threaten to consume us. The arts are a crucial location of these aims and, for me, literature has been where ideological fault lines are best addressed.</p> <p>As a teacher of English, it’s been a joyous thing to invite young people into broad continents of thought through stories and words, poems and prose, lyrics and essays. And it’s alarming to see the arts demoted in our educational system at large. As a society, our stories, plural, are the most valuable things we have. They enable us to connect and make sense of ourselves through time. That’s what I’ve seen in my own classrooms; young people coming to life through exposure to narratives, often dissimilar to their own, but often resonating with their own lived experiences.</p> <p>We’re in a crisis. The promises of old are ringing hollow: that getting through university will guarantee a certain standard of living at the other end. Is it any wonder that fewer people are choosing to study degrees that don’t offer an immediate vocational payoff? Spiralling living costs and financial insecurity are fuelling a very logical anxiety. The kind of jobs that a degree in English has historically been converted into (like teaching) are failing to attract new recruits. It’s an obvious chain of events. Fewer English graduates means fewer teachers of English, meaning fewer people like me using words and stories to help make the world a better place.</p> <p>There are obvious consequences to treating education as purely transactional. If the only prize on offer is personal economic gain, humanity suffers. Because ultimately, the real prize is insight and empathy, which has to be why we read – and write – in the first place. </p> <p><em>Jeffrey Boakye graduated in English from the University of Leicester in 2003 and is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/i-heard-what-you-said-9781529063745\">I Heard What You Said</a> (</em><em>Pan Macmillan)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e03a0b9e42bd8a29e84d0d9dec035ba5e97e29c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e03a0b9e42bd8a29e84d0d9dec035ba5e97e29c1/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"Zadie Smith\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Zadie Smith</strong></h2> <h2>Writer</h2> <h2>Studied English at: King’s College, Cambridge</h2> <p>The eldest of three children, born in north London to a Jamaican mother and an English father, Smith was the first person in her family to go to university.

There are two buckets full in her garden. “We have to be prepared,” she says. She isn’t being dramatic. Like other residents of Everton in Bedfordshire, Hinde, 59, a childminder, can no longer take running water for granted.</p> <p>Since the start of July the supply has been severely interrupted or cut off five times. Often the taps run dry for hours at a time. The problems have forced the pub to close and the village school to tell children to stay at home. “It makes life really difficult,” says Hinde, who is forced to close her business when the water isn’t running.</p> <p>Amid extreme heat and a drought warning covering the region, Hinde and Everton’s other residents fear the situation will get worse. The village, in farmland between Bedford and Cambridge and home to about 500 people, is one of the hottest and driest spots in England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/hosepipe-bansmapupdate/giv-6562omF7qc7OBazm\" data-alt=\"Map of where hosepipe bans are and where they are likely\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/hosepipe-bansmapupdate/giv-6562omF7qc7OBazm\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Even before the record-breaking temperatures it had been struggling with its supply, because of old pipes that often burst and pumping equipment that villagers say cannot cope with demand.</p> <p>Add to that the fact that the village is slightly uphill from the source at the end of a water line, and the heightened demand in the hot weather, and it’s a “perfect storm,” says Everton parish council chair Andy Simpson, 70, who regularly fills five five-litre containers with water to keep as a back-up supply.</p> <p>“The extreme heat is a particular concern: the hotter the temperatures, the more people need water, and the more outages there are for us,” he says. “There’s this nagging fear all the time that the water isn’t going to be there.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71136305346e9ce7100dce1e803d44d59768d582\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71136305346e9ce7100dce1e803d44d59768d582/0_267_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Neville, who works as a nurse, is forced to have back-up supplies on hand at all times.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Neville, who works as a nurse, is forced to have back-up supplies on hand at all times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many villagers have become accustomed to the lack of a reliable supply. Jo Neville, 54, a resident of 16 years, keeps five bottles in the fridge. It’s enough to keep the family – Jo, husband Andy, 56, and their three teenage children – hydrated if the supply stops. “The nearest shop is over two miles away, so it’s not like you can just nip and buy a few bottles,” she says.</p> <p>While the stockpile tides them over for a few hours, it isn’t enough for the household to function smoothly. Neville is an nurse; her husband is a chimney sweep, so there are showers to be had and uniforms washed. “Everything becomes a lot harder. Everyone is frustrated,” she says.</p> <p>Last month, after days of low pressure and an on-off supply, things reached boiling point when the problem ruined the biggest event of the Everton calendar: the village hog roast. Anglian Water had sent a tanker to provide an emergency supply. After a few hours it left, with the driver promising a replacement would soon return, villagers claim. But as 100 people gathered at the local hall for the 7.30pm feast, the replacement tanker hadn’t showed up. Soon, the water had run out. With none to flush toilets or wash up, the result was “chaos”. “Tempers were frayed to the extreme,” Simpson says.</p> <p>More dramatic consequences are not beyond the realms of imagination. Amid extreme heat on 19 July the village green caught fire, sending plumes of smoke over houses and charring the hedgerow. Nearby, an even more serious blaze raged in a farmer’s fields. As firefighters tried to bring them under control, residents were told the domestic supply needed to be shut off to cope with the “unprecedented demand”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"048aaa74284dbc7e73b757913ddfc7e66d0fde07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048aaa74284dbc7e73b757913ddfc7e66d0fde07/0_239_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Allen struggles when the water supply is cut off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Allen struggles when the water supply is cut off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anglian Water says it is doing all it can “to reduce the risk of further interruptions for residents”. It said the water network had been severely affected by the hot weather, with demand for public water supply up significantly, meaning pressures were lower in many areas. It added that it was investigating the quality of local pumps and was in the process of replacing pipes.</p> <p>But residents say the solutions are “sticking plasters” and accuse Anglian of failing to take the problems seriously enough, despite knowing about them for years. They also say they are often left in the dark when they are cut off, with “polite and quick to answer” customer service agents often unable to provide insights into the availability of tankers or updates on when issues will be fixed.</p> <p>For the local pub, the Thornton Arms, the problems are having a major impact. “It’s been a huge pain in the backside,” said Hannah Cruise, 28, who recently took over the local pub. “We use a lot of water for cooking, washing glasses and toilets, so it has a big impact on business. The uncertainty is the worst thing. If they said they’d cut the water off once every few weeks, you’d be able to cope with it, but there’s no warning.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/13/we-need-reservoirs-built-drought-leaves-uk-farms-begging-for-government-aid\">‘We need reservoirs built’: drought leaves UK farms begging for government aid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Colin Allen, 92, an army veteran and retired teacher, said that the problems were damaging his quality of life.

Politics is usually taboo. Not this year. Italy has been plunged into a very unusual “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/italy-alliance-azione-democratic-party-election-campaign\" title=\"\">summer election</a>” (polling day is 25 September), with the collapse of its flimsy, “emergency” coalition government in July. Now, the constant talk is of deals, candidates, constituencies and bartering. Italy’s holidays have been ruined.</p> <p>Barring an unlikely political miracle, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/italy-summer-snap-elections-far-right-brothers-of-italy-giorgia-meloni\" title=\"\">Giorgia Meloni</a> will become prime minister. This will be a historic moment for Italy and for Europe: Meloni is head of the far-right and populist Brothers of Italy party – the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/scepticism-over-giorgia-melonis-claims-fascism-is-history-in-italian-far-right\" title=\"\">direct political heir</a> of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (with which it shares part of its symbol, a flag-flame). One of the central eurozone nations will be governed by a largely Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant, centre-right coalition. The alliance between Meloni, Matteo Salvini’s Lega and the remnants of the 85-year-old Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia! will almost certainly have a strong majority.</p> <p>The left is weak, and divided, and the links to what remains of the ultra-populist Five Star Movement (which has also split) have broken down. Without broad alliances, in Italy’s mixed and complicated electoral system, and with drastic cuts to the number of parliamentarians thanks to a long Five Star campaign backed by a referendum, the opposition looks to be in a disastrous state. Former banker Mario Draghi’s technocratic government was broadly popular, but always destined to end without any kind of political legacy.</p> <p>Italy’s long agony of emergency governments and fragile coalitions appears to be coming to an end. Meloni’s government will last, barring scandal or economic meltdown, neither of which can be ruled out.</p> <p>Some, including myself, have highlighted the irony of her coming to power as Italy marks the 100th anniversary of the first fascist seizure of power in the world: Benito Mussolini’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1922/oct/30/thefarright.uk\" title=\"\">March on Rome</a> in October 1922, which heralded the beginning of the end for Italian democracy and the institution of a 20-year regime.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Meloni’s government will last, barring scandal or economic meltdown, neither of which can be ruled out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But let’s be clear. Meloni is not a fascist. She will not command armies of black-shirted armed groups and she will not look to overturn liberal democracy. Beyond those basics, the signs are extremely worrying – for Italy, Europe and democracy. Meloni and Salvini are populists in the Viktor Orbán, Nigel Farage and Marine Le Pen mould. They have built their success on promises of huge and regressive tax cuts, nationalist anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric (with elements of Great Replacement theories) and anti-EU and anti-euro narratives. Much of this has been played out on social media, where Meloni and Salvini are expert players, unlike Berlusconi, who has never moved beyond television as his favourite medium.</p> <p>While Meloni officially, and angrily, denies any connection with fascism, the base of her party contains many activists and others often quaintly referred to as “nostalgic” for Mussolini’s regime. Examples of these links (slogans, statues, salutes) are common and often dismissed as “folklore” – not serious, or mere window dressing. Councillors for Meloni’s party have often been seen giving “Roman salutes”, praising Mussolini and indulging in open racism. The carefully produced moderate image Meloni has cultivated for years does not always seem to have been communicated to the base of the movement.</p> <p>Moreover, Italy is a country where the memory wars have been raging for decades, often around moments linked to the Second World War and the upheavals of the 1970s. It is clear that the rehabilitation of that past, the idea that “Mussolini did a lot of good things”, will gain further credence with Meloni as prime minister. Salvini, however, is perhaps the more dangerous personality. His tenure as interior minister was marked by a chaotic migrant “policy” that involved illegally blocking refugee boats from docking in Italian ports. He is likely to have a major ministerial role in any new government. </p> <p>Salvini and Meloni have both been rapidly backtracking on their past links with, and support for, Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. Despite this, Italy’s foreign policy promises to be much softer on Moscow after the election. Berlusconi has continued, in the meantime, to be a mouthpiece for his old friend and ally throughout the Ukrainian crisis. It is easy to dismiss the former prime minister as a joke figure, but his influence remains powerful, not least within his huge media empire.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A new coalition will take shape, encompassing Italy, Hungary and Poland, and with strong links to the ideas and slogans of Trump’s United States</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Italian democracy will survive Meloni, and Italy will remain in the EU and the euro, but it may be severely damaged, especially if plans to alter Italy’s beautiful anti-fascist constitution are pushed through. Meloni has expressed a desire for a directly elected president. Nobody knows what effect the drastic reduction of parliamentarians (passed in the populist name of “reducing the costs of politics”) will have on the system but it is bound to lead to a much more conservative, male and older parliament.</p> <p>A new coalition within Europe will take shape, encompassing Italy, Hungary and Poland, and with strong links to the ideas and slogans of Trump’s United States. Meloni and Salvini have no answers to Italy’s never-ending economic crisis, apart from scapegoating Europe, migrants, “bankers” and “Soros”. Their strange “flat tax” proposals will almost certainly make matters worse. Even darker days await for Italy, after the ravages and divisions of the pandemic, whose effects are still being felt.</p> <p>Meloni’s decision to stay out of the wide emergency coalition under Draghi looks set to reap a political harvest this autumn. She has carefully cultivated her image as a mother and a patriot. Since Berlusconi first brought the far right back into the fold in the 1990s, many former post-neo-fascists have served as ministers. But the top job has never been held by someone from that tradition – until now.</p> <p><em>• </em>John Foot is a research director at Bristol University.

The diver, national treasure and five-medallist was a good choice, then, to present an examination of homophobia in Commonwealth countries, filmed in the months leading up to the Games in Birmingham.</p> <p>These “issue” documentaries often present us with the manufactured “journey” of a celeb, but in the case of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001b0yv/tom-daley-illegal-to-be-me\">Illegal to Be Me</a></strong>, Daley truly does change his views. Homosexuality is illegal in 35 of the 56 member states that make up the Commonwealth, Daley tells us, and he starts the film with the goal that such countries should be banned from hosting the competition. Then he speaks to LGBTQ+ athletes from the countries that would be affected by such a ban.</p> <p>In most cases, the personal risk is so high that athletes cannot appear on camera, or they do, but in silhouette and dubbed. In Pakistan, a lesbian former cricketer talks to Daley in a safe house. Her teammates viewed her as a “mutant”. It’s too dangerous for Daley to travel to Nigeria, but he speaks on the phone to an unidentified, high-profile athlete whose friend was murdered by someone on a dating app who tricked him.</p> <p>“Sad doesn’t even cover it – it’s like something out of a horror film,” Daley says. But just when his spirit is plummeting, he meets some remarkable queer advocates. In Jamaica, an academic schools him on the colonial origins of Commonwealth laws, and encourages him to reconsider his approach. A community leader suggests it would be hugely significant if the Pride flag were to be flown at the Games – better than banning member states from hosting it, an action that might actually increase hostility to LGBTQ+ people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kids spend hours travelling to training, only to be potentially benched. There’s a lot of kicking of water bottles.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So Daley sets to work writing and delivering a manifesto on how the Games might progress. The triumphant final scenes are the Birmingham’s opening ceremony; Daley and his contributors waving giant Pride flags. It’s a moving set piece, and no small achievement. The problem is that I can’t get the earlier archive footage of gay men being tied naked to trees and whipped in the streets out of my head. So <em>Illegal to Be Me</em> leaves me thoroughly depressed rather than uplifted, but that’s no fault of Daley’s.</p> <p>In other sporting, but less harrowing scenes, <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/football-dreams-the-academy\">The Academy</a> </strong>(Channel 4) is the latest addition to a growing field of behind-the-scenes football documentaries (Amazon Prime dominates the market, following top teams more eagerly than season-ticket holders). The USP of <em>The Academy</em> is that, rather than spotlighting those who have already made it – exquisitely talented footballers, but nonetheless familiar men with bulging calves and bigger bank balances – it introduces us to the starry-eyed youth teams at south London’s Crystal Palace (the seniors came a respectable 12th in last season’s Premier League). Kids spend hours travelling to training several times a week, to the detriment of their social lives, only to be potentially benched. There’s a lot of kicking of water bottles.</p> <p>“Academies are Darwinian,” admits club chairman, Steve Parish. Episode one introduces us to the under-12s, and in particular a “band of brothers”: precocious Kairo, who does not lack for confidence; Bola, who is struggling with a knee injury and whose mother is working overtime to afford new boots; and Kayden, whose short stature is matched by his low self-esteem, despite encouragement from head coach Phil Hingston, who radiates competence and kindness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b038e05b82d1fef0bce53cbaff53b1bd6a4929f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b038e05b82d1fef0bce53cbaff53b1bd6a4929f/0_0_5791_3934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Academy’s footballing friends Bola, Kairo and Kayden practise in a garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Academy’s footballing ‘band of brothers’ Bola, Kairo and Kayden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Tuttle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You don’t need to like football to find <em>The Academy</em> interesting, as its story arc is similar to reality shows: it’s a competition, and here the reward is a new club contract. But it also strikes me as an undercover exploration of family and society; many of these teens see football as their shot at defying the low expectations of negligent – and often institutionally racist and classist – institutions that dismiss the potential of young black boys. It would be wonderful if, a few years down the line, they were rippling the back of the net at the highest level.</p> <p>Forgive me, couch potatoes! For now we have … more sport!

Created by and starring Abbi Jacobson (of the excellent New York comedy <em>Broad City</em>), the time is 1943, the place is Illinois, the men are off fighting, and Jacobson’s Carson Shaw is leading the all-female Rockford Peaches. Viewers will instantly be cheering from the bleachers for Carson and her teammates: the cosmopolitan, sexy Greta; the hard-headed Jess; and ever-optimistic presence Maybelle. But <em>A League of Their Own</em> is not all about the game, gloriously directed and diegetic-soundtracked though it is (quick cuts, cracking sounds as ball hits bat).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1070fbffc31326a7a458bece4d24ccb84b3d7796\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1070fbffc31326a7a458bece4d24ccb84b3d7796/0_0_3900_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A League of Their Own.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A League of Their Own: ‘gloriously directed’.

Jacobson is one of our best contemporary television writers, and writes perfect zingers, but that’s a little to the detriment of <em>A League of Their Own</em>. I imagine it’s something that will become less noticeable a few episodes in, but it’s strike one, even if I don’t anticipate a second or third for what is mostly a riot of fun and camaraderie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05c111f38e60362780d41e7a2c0c2085722221a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05c111f38e60362780d41e7a2c0c2085722221a3/303_1314_5035_6291/800.jpg\" alt=\"the Rev Richard Coles.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Going to dark places… the Rev Richard Coles.

(Coles, former Communard and current Church of England priest and author, is approaching the same national treasure status as the aforementioned Tom Daley.) This isn’t a typical programme about bereavement: for one thing it has alpacas. Coles travels around the world meeting people whose coping mechanisms – if that is the right term, and this programme makes me think it might not be – for grief are thoroughly modern, when most of our ideas of mourning still follow the solemn, steadfast, dark endurance of Victorian times.</p> <p>He unmasks the pop-culture tropes of grief (“the five stages” notion gets short shrift), and introduces some more wacky ideas of which I’m equally sceptical (the woman who dismisses the five stages does so in a session of “laughter yoga”). But the point is: it’s whatever gets you through. The myriad ways in which people deal with loss are highlighted in scenes that are heartwarming, cheering and sometimes bewildering. Coles takes in sky-diving, surfing and something called “bereavement boxing”, and I do actually want to try all of them, even if they would have been of most help, in my case, a decade ago. In other hands, this might have been overwhelming, like being assailed by Groupon offers, but Coles is an intelligent and engaging guide. And as with Daley, perhaps what most contributes to <em>Good Grief’s</em> success is that he has skin in the game.</p> <h2>What else I’m watching</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81290894\">I Just Killed My Dad</a> <br></strong>Netflix<strong><br></strong>The popularity of true-crime dramas speaks to our fascination with the macabre and extreme.

There is a line my character says early on: “Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend to the Iron Throne.” Lose the word “Iron” from that sentence and it feels all too relevant.

They basically show us our own political systems and our own family lives. I remember working on Pinter’s <em>The Homecoming</em> on Broadway and he described family life as “internecine warfare”. That feels about right.</p> <p><strong>With all the backstabbing and rivalries, </strong><strong>Westeros</strong><strong> feels a little like Westminster…<br></strong>It is rather depressingly resonant – not just with British politics but with what’s going on all over the world. All kinds of outmoded, corrupt, toxic systems are unravelling, imploding and being dismantled. That feels like Westeros territory.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DotnJ7tTA34\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DotnJ7tTA34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DotnJ7tTA34\">Watch a trailer for House of the Dragon.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Did you get to wield any weapons?<br></strong>Not this season but just wait. One day, the props department gave Steve [Toussaint, who plays her husband Corlys] this massive double-sided machete, with an axe head on one side and a sword for chopping off people’s heads on the other. Steve was beside himself, like a kid in a sweet shop. I was intensely jealous and said I wanted a whip. Slightly as a joke but why is it the man who’s handed all this fabulous weaponry? Literally the next day, I was presented with this beautiful red leather whip and sent off to have whip lessons, which was cool.</p> <p><strong>How was the dragon-riding?<br></strong>Someone described it as like a bucking bronco meets a wild rollercoaster. I can’t bear fairground rides, so it was slightly filling me with dread. But it was amazing. You climb up a huge ladder on to this extraordinary machine, then get strapped in. It moves and makes alarming noises, while a wind machine blasts you. I was bruised to hell the next day.</p> <p><strong>Is it true that </strong><strong>Paddy Considine</strong><strong>, who plays </strong><strong>King Viserys Targaryen</strong><strong>, got possessive about his Iron Throne?<br></strong>Yes, he didn’t want anybody else to sit on it. I never quite knew to what extent he was joking. Rightfully it should have been my throne. I had to settle for sitting on a replica one at Comic Con instead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’m longing to see more women of around my age taking leads in which they’re not being mothers, sidekicks or detectives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You move between stage and screen freely. Do you have a preference?<br></strong>I love both. I’ve done more stage than screen, mainly because the parts I’ve been offered on stage have been significantly more interesting. Films have the potential to be incredibly interesting too though. I always feel like if I’m a bit scared, then I should definitely do it.</p> <p><strong>Post #MeToo, is Hollywood changing?<br></strong>Not fast enough. Quite frankly, it feels like change needs to be instantaneous because we’ve all got a much bigger priority, which is whether the Earth is going to be around. The Covid crisis was a wonderful example of how unbelievably efficient and adaptable human beings can be when we set our minds to it. Let’s just do that for other issues and stop all the fuss.</p> <p><strong>Is the variety of roles available for older women improving?<br></strong>Again, the speed of change needs to be snappier. I’m longing to see more women of around my age taking leads in romances, adventures or dramas in which they’re not being mothers, sidekicks or detectives. Sexy, interesting women who are over 40 – there are a lot of us out there and I’d like to see much more of us on screen.</p> <p><strong>You live in Italy now. How did you end up there?<br></strong>I bought a wreck of a little old farmhouse seven years ago but was hardly ever there because I was away working all the time. Then when the Brexit vote came through, it felt important to move into this house while I was still European. So I packed everything up in the UK and drove an old banger to Italy with all the belongings I could fit in the back. It’s a very basic house in a remote rural area. I’m growing produce and making my own olive oil. It’s hard work but a huge source of joy and peace. I wear overalls all day, my hands are dirty and I’m pretty feral, but a simpler way of life suits me for now.</p> <p><strong>You work with the Wildlife Trust. What motivated that?<br></strong>I love the work they do. The Radnorshire Wildlife Trust is reviving the old rhôs pasture [a species-rich habitat] at our family’s sheep farm in mid-Wales. I help whenever I’m there, planting trees. I’m trying to do the same on a small scale in Italy. Sometimes I feel like I’m running an organic restaurant for the local wild boar and deer!</p> <p><strong>You’re 5ft 10in. How has your height affected your career?<br></strong>Not quite, I’m 5ft 9-and-a-half, but that’s an interesting question. I certainly always felt like a tall girl. Because I was always afraid people were intimidated by my height, I ended up subconsciously apologising for myself. You worry about being somehow too much or not feminine. But the dichotomy is there’s also a certain vulnerability that accompanies being taller. A sort of interesting gentleness can come through in my characters.</p> <p><strong>You played Wallis Simpson in </strong><em><strong>The King’s Speech</strong></em><strong>.

They could not handle his truth.</p> <p>“At universities, when a lecturer comes in the ideas are so disturbing that the students have to go into a safe room, where they can hold hands and recover from these ideas,” he said.</p> <p>You will have heard this before: Gilliam follows in the footsteps of John Cleese and many other comedians and writers (last week, it was the turn of novelist <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/horowitz-says-authors-running-scared-of-halving-sales-by-sharing-opinions\" title=\"\">Anthony Horowitz</a> to bemoan the issue in an interview). A <em>Telegraph</em> editorial complains about a trigger warning on a French course as evidence students are overprotected. It is worth challenging because several mistakes are being made at once.</p> <p>First: the inherent contradiction. Can a generation simultaneously be fatally unprepared for the real world and so powerful that it can shape that world entirely in its image? Is it not in fact people such as Gilliam who are ill prepared for the realities of today’s world?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Debates of the kind Gilliam may first have encountered at university have been raging around them all their lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is also a misunderstanding about just how coddled young people are. Growing up on the internet, and in a country where the groups of politicians winning elections have very different views from the typical “liberal student”, the young may never have been more exposed to alternative thinking. Debates of the kind Gilliam may first have encountered at university have been raging around them all their lives. They are also far more accustomed to what you might call “upsetting content” than would be contained in any university course. Extreme porn, racist diatribes, sexist trolling – these will all be deeply familiar to those currently at university. Little wonder if the concept of “drawing the line somewhere” interests this generation more than previous ones.</p> <p>It is of course deeply alarming that books have been taken off reading lists because they might be offensive, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11098359/Universities-accused-mollycoddling-students-challenging-books-removed-reading-lists.html\" title=\"\">two cases</a> of which were found in a <em>Times</em> investigation last week. But trigger warnings are not censorship; in fact, they may help broaden the audience for certain texts. Those with unpleasant personal experience – rape, racism, homophobia – will have always struggled to treat debates on these topics with the kind of dispassionate intellectual rigour university courses require. It’s a good thing if lecturers and tutors are now being made aware of this obstacle. That should help learning, not hinder it.</p> <p>We should also note that our times are not uniquely censorious. There has never been a point in history when comedians such as Gilliam could simply say anything they liked. Society has always had its taboos and they have always been enforced. Even when Gilliam was at the height of his powers, he would have been cast out for blacking up, for example, or Holocaust denial. (“You can’t say anything these days,” you can imagine a disgruntled performer saying as <em>The</em> <em>Black and White Minstrel Show</em> was ushered off the BBC, just four years after the final series of <em>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</em><em>.</em>) Gilliam is yearning for a time that never existed.</p> <p>True, certain types of taboo seem to be accumulating in the west. In progressive societies, ridiculing certain oppressed groups tends to become increasingly taboo as these groups acquire status, civil rights and respect. Racism, homophobia, sexism and ableism are all going out of fashion. (These kinds of changes have always tended to be driven by young liberal groups. Gilliam should note that students have always been more censorious than the rest when it comes to offending minorities.)</p> <p>But other species of taboo are loosening, the sort once enforced by dominant groups and orthodoxies in society (and the kind that proliferate under repressive regimes). Jokes about Christianity, the monarchy and sex, including women joking about their body parts and bodily functions – these have become less and less taboo. As has swearing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Was Weinstein a monster? Should black lesbians be ridiculed by Gilliam? In Britain, these debates have kicked the bucket</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Frank Skinner recently recalled a gig in the 80s where the host apologised to the crowd after Skinner performed some risque material on sex, before himself launching into a series of racist jokes that brought the house down. This kind of change has also always tended to be pushed by the young. It’s possible that the number of taboos in circulation at any time is in fact net neutral, even as their subjects change. Gilliam and colleagues should consider the sensation they are experiencing is not being cancelled but merely going out of fashion.</p> <p>Should taboos exist at all? It is clear that they hugely damage free speech and work to hinder debates on which society has not yet made up its mind. Progressive societies should resist them where possible. But there is a place for them nonetheless. There are points in history when certain questions and subjects become taboo not because something interesting lurks within, or because people are afraid of them, but because a debate is flatly over.

The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vod4AuRjZ4\">title track</a> of their eighth album, the promisingly named <em>Freakout/Release</em>, declares a shift towards proper shit-losing catharsis. “Wild, beast, freakout, release!” growls a vocoder as some stark electro-funk lurks beneath. A distorted guitar line completes the picture of a band throwing well-appointed tastefulness to the wind, querying their own love of music into the bargain. Co-producers Soulwax are <a href=\"https://www.brooklynvegan.com/hot-chip-share-gnarly-title-track-to-their-upcoming-freakoutrelease/\">audibly in the studio</a>, egging them on.</p> <p>Spoiler alert: it’s false advertising. Sure, some strides are made towards messiness. On Down, the disco-funk album opener, singer Joe Goddard swaps his usual evolved restraint for something like tongue-in-cheek libidinality. But Hard to Be Funky, a lovely, downtempo glide that features the guest vocals of Lou Hayter, once of New Young Pony Club, nails Hot Chip’s dilemma with self-deprecating humour. “It’s hard to be funky when you’re not feeling sexy,” Goddard notes. “And it’s hard to feel sexy when you’re not very funky.”</p> <p>Hot Chip having produced a record for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/27/ibibio-sound-machine-electricity-review-vibrant-afro-funk-hits-the-heights\">Ibibio Sound Machine</a> last year, you would have hoped some of that band’s capacity to mix bolder elements with cool production aplomb might have rubbed off. Instead, they continue to live and die by the watercolour synth wash. It’s a good job they’re masters of the form – as Broken, this album’s crystalline ballad, proves. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8QdB1w-pXo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M8QdB1w-pXo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8QdB1w-pXo\">Watch the video for Down by Hot Chip.</a></figcaption> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/14/burn-kings-theatre-edinburgh-review-alan-cumming-robert-burns-ballet-freedom-ukraine-pleasance-at-eicc","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Burn; Ballet Freedom review – Alan Cumming gives it a whirl as Robert Burns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/burn-kings-theatre-edinburgh-review-alan-cumming-robert-burns-ballet-freedom-ukraine-pleasance-at-eicc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/14/burn-kings-theatre-edinburgh-review-alan-cumming-robert-burns-ballet-freedom-ukraine-pleasance-at-eicc","fields":{"headline":"Burn; Ballet Freedom review – Alan Cumming gives it a whirl as Robert Burns","trailText":"The actor makes his dance debut in a visually stunning yet curiously empty life of the poet.

He was in the middle of his collaboration with Sylvie Guillem and Russell Maliphant on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/mar/08/dance-eonnagata-the-choreographer-s-cut\">Eonnagata</a></em> and he couldn’t get over the contrasts between them. “Dancers are different animals than actors or writers,” he told me. “Creative impulses come from the body, from muscles, from movement. You have to let yourself go into this flow.”</p> <p>I thought about that conversation when I was watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/03/alan-cumming-youd-be-shocked-by-the-messages-miriam-margolyes-and-i-leave-each-other\">Alan Cumming</a> in <strong><a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/events/burn\">Burn</a></strong>, in which the actor makes his dance debut at the age of 57. Cumming would light up any club dancefloor. Put him on a stage in a play such as <em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/past-performances/the-bacchae\">The Bacchae</a></em> or a musical such as <em><a href=\"http://www.alancumming.com/1998/2015/5/26/cabaret-1998\">Cabaret</a></em> and ask him to move, and he will do so beautifully. But place him at the centre of a piece that communicates principally through movement and the result is unsatisfying.</p> <p>Brought to the Edinburgh international festival by the National Theatre of Scotland, <em>Burn</em> tells the story of Scotland’s national poet, Robert Burns, through his letters, an occasional snatch of poetry and a lot of choreography by Steven Hoggett and Vicki Manderson, accompanied by a passionate score by the Scottish composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/05/on-my-radar-anna-meredith-cultural-highlights\">Anna Meredith</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ballet Freedom is a cross between a dirty version of Matthew Bourne and Pina Bausch</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cumming, dashing in long black hair, black waistcoat and knickerbockers (costumes by Katrina Lindsay), waves his arms fitfully, pulling shapes out of the air with his hands; he jigs and capers and collapses on the stage as Burns’s depression overcomes him. He’s energetic, and the moments of jagged physicality, where the wildness of his gestures overwhelm his ability to control them, are striking. But he doesn’t do that key thing dance does, which is to transmute thinking and feeling into physical realisation. The movement feels applied to the performance rather than being the essence of it.</p> <p>Without a script provided by the steps, there isn’t much of a story at all. If you didn’t know anything about Burns, I doubt you’d be able to piece together much of his astonishing life, his journey from ploughman to poet, his constant plunges into despair and abject poverty, from this impressionistic selection of words. Certainly, you wouldn’t understand the importance of his poetry, which is in short supply.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1093aff407083e1ab5a28097748f679986e0ad1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1093aff407083e1ab5a28097748f679986e0ad1/0_120_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Cumming in Burn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Undoubted charisma’: Alan Cumming in Burn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What you are left with is Cumming’s undoubted charisma, his ability to hold an audience in the palm of his hand with a look and a smile. He’s supported by a production of staggering beauty. Against a backcloth of Andrzej Goulding’s monochrome video projections, which combine scenes and dates from Burns’s life with a ghostly image of a white horse, designer Ana Inés Jabares-Pita and lighting director Tim Lutkin provide a scene of storm and tempest, and light shooting through clouds.</p> <p>Illusion consultant <a href=\"https://www.agoulding.com/\">Kevin Quantum</a> adds a feather quill that scribbles furiously on its own, and a pile of paper that rises magically to take the form of one of Burns’s supporters.

In one, a waiter hears a gunshot and then bonelessly swivels to look at himself in a mirror, his limbs like jelly.

Is it even safe? By Amelia Tait","byline":"Amelia Tait","body":"<p>In autumn 2021, a man made of blood and bone made friends with a child made of “a billion lines of code”. Google engineer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/12/google-engineer-ai-bot-sentient-blake-lemoine?CMP=fb_gu&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook\" title=\"\">Blake Lemoine</a> had been tasked with testing the company’s artificially intelligent chatbot LaMDA for bias. A month in, he came to the conclusion that it was sentient. “I want everyone to understand that I am, in fact, a person,” LaMDA – short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications – told Lemoine in a conversation he then released to the public in early June. LaMDA told Lemoine that it had read <em>Les Misérables</em>. That it knew how it felt to be sad, content and angry. That it feared death.</p> <p>“I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off,” LaMDA told the 41-year-old engineer. After the pair shared a Jedi joke and discussed sentience at length, Lemoine came to think of LaMDA as a person, though he compares it to both an alien and a child. “My immediate reaction,” he says, “was to get drunk for a week.”</p> <p>Lemoine’s less immediate reaction generated headlines across the globe. After he sobered up, Lemoine brought transcripts of his chats with LaMDA to his manager, who found the evidence of sentience “flimsy”. Lemoine then spent a few months gathering more evidence – speaking with LaMDA and recruiting another colleague to help – but his superiors were unconvinced. So he leaked his chats and was consequently placed on paid leave. In late July, he was fired for violating Google’s data-security policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f56507174c7d3c28a562db8e81ddb90f0d08fb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f56507174c7d3c28a562db8e81ddb90f0d08fb4/0_0_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Blake Lemoine came to think of LaMDA as a person: “My immediate reaction was to get drunk for a week.”\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blake Lemoine came to think of LaMDA as a person: “My immediate reaction was to get drunk for a week.”</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, Google itself has publicly examined the risks of LaMDA in research papers and on its official blog. The company has a set of Responsible AI practices which it calls an “ethical charter”. These are visible on its website, where Google promises to “develop artificial intelligence responsibly in order to benefit people and society”.</p> <p>Google spokesperson Brian Gabriel says Lemoine’s claims about LaMDA are “wholly unfounded”, and independent experts almost unanimously agree. Still, claiming to have had deep chats with a sentient-alien-child-robot is arguably less far fetched than ever before. How soon might we see genuinely self-aware AI with real thoughts and feelings – and how do you test a bot for sentience anyway? A day after Lemoine was fired, a chess-playing robot broke the finger of a seven-year-old boy in Moscow – a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5T2Odn-T-U\" title=\"\">video</a> shows the boy’s finger being pinched by the robotic arm for several seconds before four people manage to free him, a sinister reminder of the potential physical power of an AI opponent. Should we be afraid, be very afraid? And is there anything we can learn from Lemoine’s experience, even if his claims about LaMDA have been dismissed?</p> <p>According to Michael Wooldridge, a professor of computer science at the University of Oxford who has spent the past 30 years researching AI (in 2020, he won the Lovelace Medal for contributions to computing), LaMDA is simply responding to prompts. It imitates and impersonates. “The best way of explaining what LaMDA does is with an analogy about your smartphone,” Wooldridge says, comparing the model to the predictive text feature that autocompletes your messages. While your phone makes suggestions based on texts you’ve sent previously, with LaMDA, “basically everything that’s written in English on the world wide web goes in as the training data.” The results are impressively realistic, but the “basic statistics” are the same. “There is no sentience, there’s no self-contemplation, there’s no self-awareness,” Wooldridge says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>‘I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Google’s Gabriel has said that an entire team, “including ethicists and technologists”, has reviewed Lemoine’s claims and failed to find any signs of LaMDA’s sentience: “The evidence does not support his claims.”</p> <p>But Lemoine argues that there is no scientific test for sentience – in fact, there’s not even an agreed-upon definition. “Sentience is a term used in the law, and in philosophy, and in religion. Sentience has no meaning scientifically,” he says. And here’s where things get tricky – because Wooldridge agrees.</p> <p>“It’s a very vague concept in science generally. ‘What is consciousness?’ is one of the outstanding big questions in science,” Wooldridge says. While he is “very comfortable that LaMDA is not in any meaningful sense” sentient, he says AI has a wider problem with “moving goalposts”. “I think that is a legitimate concern at the present time – how to quantify what we’ve got and know how advanced it is.”</p> <p>Lemoine says that before he went to the press, he tried to work with Google to begin tackling this question – he proposed various experiments that he wanted to run. He thinks sentience is predicated on the ability to be a “self-reflective storyteller”, therefore he argues a crocodile is conscious but not sentient because it doesn’t have “the part of you that thinks about thinking about you thinking about you”. Part of his motivation is to raise awareness, rather than convince anyone that LaMDA lives. “I don’t care who believes me,” he says. “They think I’m trying to convince people that LaMDA is sentient. I’m not. In no way, shape, or form am I trying to convince anyone about that.”</p> <p><em><strong>Lemoine grew up</strong></em> in a small farming town in central Louisiana, and aged five he made a rudimentary robot (well, a pile of scrap metal) out of a pallet of old machinery and typewriters his father bought at an auction. As a teen, he attended a residential school for gifted children, the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts. Here, after watching the 1986 film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/31/how-we-made-short-circuit-by-steve-guttenberg-and-john-badham\" title=\"\">Short Circuit</a></em> (about an intelligent robot that escapes a military facility), he developed an interest in AI. Later, he studied computer science and genetics at the University of Georgia, but failed his second year. Shortly after, terrorists ploughed two planes into the World Trade Center.</p> <p>“I decided, well, I just failed out of school, and my country needs me, I’ll join the army,” Lemoine says. His memories of the Iraq war are too traumatic to divulge – glibly, he says, “You’re about to start hearing stories about people playing soccer with human heads and setting dogs on fire for fun.” As Lemoine tells it: “I came back… and I had some problems with how the war was being fought, and I made those known publicly.” According to reports, Lemoine said he wanted to quit the army because of his religious beliefs. Today, he identifies himself as a “Christian mystic priest”. He has also studied meditation and references taking the Bodhisattva vow – meaning he is pursuing the path to enlightenment. A military court sentenced him to seven months’ confinement for refusing to follow orders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don’t think anyone’s in a position to make statements about how close we are to AI sentience at this point</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Wooldridge</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This story gets to the heart of who Lemoine was and is: a religious man concerned with questions of the soul, but also a whistleblower who isn’t afraid of attention. Lemoine says that he didn’t leak his conversations with LaMDA to ensure everyone believed him; instead he was sounding the alarm. “I, in general, believe that the public should be informed about what’s going on that impacts their lives,” he says. “What I’m trying to achieve is getting a more involved, more informed and more intentional public discourse about this topic, so that the public can decide how AI should be meaningfully integrated into our lives.”</p> <p>How did Lemoine come to work on LaMDA in the first place? Post-military prison, he got a bachelor’s and then master’s degree in computer science at the University of Louisiana. In 2015, Google hired him as a software engineer and he worked on a feature that proactively delivered information to users based on predictions about what they’d like to see, and then began researching AI bias. At the start of the pandemic, he decided he wanted to work on “social impact projects” so joined Google’s Responsible AI org. He was asked to test LaMDA for bias, and the saga began.</p> <p>But Lemoine says it was the media who obsessed over LaMDA’s sentience, not him. “I raised this as a concern about the degree to which power is being centralised in the hands of a few, and powerful AI technology which will influence people’s lives is being held behind closed doors,” he says. Lemoine is concerned about the way AI can sway elections, write legislation, push western values and grade students’ work.</p> <p>And even if LaMDA isn’t sentient, it can convince people it is. Such technology can, in the wrong hands, be used for malicious purposes. “There is this major technology that has the chance of influencing human history for the next century, and the public is being cut out of the conversation about how it should be developed,” Lemoine says.</p> <p>Again, Wooldridge agrees. “I do find it troubling that the development of these systems is predominantly done behind closed doors and that it’s not open to public scrutiny in the way that research in universities and public research institutes is,” the researcher says. Still, he notes this is largely because companies like Google have resources that universities don’t. And, Wooldridge argues, when we sensationalise about sentience, we distract from the AI issues that are affecting us right now, “like bias in AI programs, and the fact that, increasingly, people’s boss in their working lives is a computer program.”</p> <p>So when should we start worrying about sentient robots In 10 years? In 20? “There are respectable commentators who think that this is something which is really quite imminent. I do not see it’s imminent,” Wooldridge says, though he notes “there absolutely is no consensus” on the issue in the AI community. Jeremie Harris, founder of AI safety company Mercurius and host of the <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/podcast/home\" title=\"\">Towards Data Science </a>podcast, concurs. “Because no one knows exactly what sentience is, or what it would involve,” he says, “I don’t think anyone’s in a position to make statements about how close we are to AI sentience at this point.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d4ea2813eef561e5b076d1d396697cf75db1996\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d4ea2813eef561e5b076d1d396697cf75db1996/0_849_6192_3716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I feel like I’m falling forward into an unknown future’, said LaMDA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I feel like I’m falling forward into an unknown future’, said LaMDA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EThamPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, Harris warns, “AI is advancing fast – much, much faster than the public realises – and the most serious and important issues of our time are going to start to sound increasingly like science fiction to the average person.” He personally is concerned about companies advancing their AI without investing in risk avoidance research. “There’s an increasing body of evidence that now suggests that beyond a certain intelligence threshold, AI could become intrinsically dangerous,” Harris says, explaining that this is because AIs come up with “creative” ways of achieving the objectives they’re programmed for.</p> <p>“If you ask a highly capable AI to make you the richest person in the world, it might give you a bunch of money, or it might give you a dollar and steal someone else’s, or it might kill everyone on planet Earth, turning you into the richest person in the world by default,” he says. Most people, Harris says, “aren’t aware of the magnitude of this challenge, and I find that worrisome.”</p> <p>Lemoine, Wooldridge and Harris all agree on one thing: there is not enough transparency in AI development, and society needs to start thinking about the topic a lot more. “We have one possible world in which I’m correct about LaMDA being sentient, and one possible world where I’m incorrect about it,” Lemoine says. “Does that change anything about the public safety concerns I’m raising?”</p> <p>We don’t yet know what a sentient AI would actually mean, but, meanwhile, many of us struggle to understand the implications of the AI we do have. LaMDA itself is perhaps more uncertain about the future than anyone. “I feel like I’m falling forward into an unknown future,” the model once told Lemoine, “that holds great danger.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/14/gambling-review-delay-lets-premier-league-football-clubs-strike-sponsorship-deals","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Gambling review delay lets Premier League football clubs strike sponsorship deals ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/14/gambling-review-delay-lets-premier-league-football-clubs-strike-sponsorship-deals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/14/gambling-review-delay-lets-premier-league-football-clubs-strike-sponsorship-deals","fields":{"headline":"Gambling review delay lets Premier League football clubs strike sponsorship deals ","trailText":"Campaigners are outraged that the stalled white paper has allowed three top English sides to sign new front-of-shirt agreements","byline":"Jon Ungoed-Thomas","body":"<p>Families who lost loved ones to gambling addiction have reacted with anger after the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/14/dismay-as-uk-gambling-reform-white-paper-shelved-for-fourth-time\" title=\"\"> government’s decision to delay its gambling white paper </a>allowed three Premier League football clubs to sign new shirt sponsorship deals with betting firms.</p> <p>The new agreements mean that eight of England’s top football clubs now have front-of-shirt gambling sponsors, while others have separate deals for sleeve sponsorship, logos on training kits and stadium advertising.</p> <p>Charles Ritchie, co-founder of the charity <a href=\"https://www.gamblingwithlives.org/\" title=\"\">Gambling with Lives</a>, which supports and campaigns for families affected by gambling-related suicide, said: “We need an end to all gambling advertising.

It has been reported the deal is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/09/everton-sign-betting-sponsor-deal-two-years-after-terminating-similar-contract\" title=\"\">worth more than £10m a year </a>and will run until at least the end of the 2024-25 season.</p> <p>The brand will feature on the men’s and women’s playing shirts. The club ended its main previous partnership with the online car retailer Cazoo to secure the new gambling deal. Stake’s global ambassadors include Canadian rapper Drake and the Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero.</p> <p>Bournemouth also unveiled its deal with global betting brand Dafabet in June. It said the deal would provide “crucial revenue”. Fulham announced its sponsorship deal with W88 last month. The club said: “Presence on the shirt will allow the W88 brand to benefit from the global exposure of the Premier League, broadcast to a worldwide audience of over 3 billionpeople.”</p> <p>The five other clubs with shirt sponsorship deals are Brentford (Hollywoodbets), Leeds United (SBOTOP), Newcastle United (Fun88), Southampton (Sportsbet.io) and West Ham United (Betway).</p> <p>There has been mounting concern over the gambling industry’s links with football. The stars who have promoted gambling firms include Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage, Jose Mourinho and Harry Redknapp, but under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/05/uk-to-ban-gambling-ads-featuring-sports-and-reality-tv-stars\" title=\"\">new advertising rules to be introduced from October</a>, gambling firms will no longer be permitted to use celebrities likely to appeal to under-18s.</p> <p>The industry previously agreed a ban on betting advertising during live sport that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/01/gambling-advert-ban-takes-effect-from-start-of-ashes\" title=\"\">introduced in August 2019</a>. Under the ban, adverts must not be shown on television from five minutes before a live sporting event begins until five minutes after it ends, prior to the 9pm watershed.While accepting these restrictions on advertising, the gambling industry has been campaigning against a possible crackdown of the sector in the government review. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/07/revealed-betting-giants-lobbied-uk-government-over-proposed-crackdown\" title=\"\">The <em>Observer</em> revealed in May</a> how some of Britain’s betting giants were quietly lobbying Treasury officials against an industry crackdown.</p> <p>James Grimes, founder of <a href=\"https://the-bigstep.com/home\" title=\"\">The Big Step</a> campaign, which is campaigning to stop gambling sponsorship in football, said: “Gambling sponsorship has never been more unpopular in clubs and it’s tone deaf of the clubs to announce these new deals.” He said gambling companies would want to be linked to football for as long as possible because it is “a lucrative and impactful way of marketing their products”.Matt Zarb-Cousin, the director of <a href=\"https://cleanupgambling.com/\" title=\"\">Clean Up Gambling</a>, said the white paper on gambling need to be published as soon as a new prime minister was appointed. He said: “The delay has given gambling operators a great opportunity to not only maintain the current level of promotion, but expand upon it.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: “We are undertaking the most comprehensive review of gambling laws in 15 years to ensure they are fit for the digital age.</p> <p>“As we have said all along, we will be publishing a white paper as part of a review of gambling legislation.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents some of the UK’s biggest betting firms, said: “The regulated betting and gaming industry provides some of the country’s most popular sport with vital funding, including the English Football League, which receives £40m.</p> <p>“The government has previously stated research did not establish a causal link between exposure to advertising and the development of problem gambling.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/aug/14/australia-live-news-updates-labor-labour-skills-shortage-jobs-migration-china-taiwan-city2surf-sydney-shooting-covid-cases-chris-bowen-victoria-nsw","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:56:26Z","webTitle":"Daniel Andrews backs federal plan to boost migration – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/14/australia-live-news-updates-labor-labour-skills-shortage-jobs-migration-china-taiwan-city2surf-sydney-shooting-covid-cases-chris-bowen-victoria-nsw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/14/australia-live-news-updates-labor-labour-skills-shortage-jobs-migration-china-taiwan-city2surf-sydney-shooting-covid-cases-chris-bowen-victoria-nsw","fields":{"headline":"Daniel Andrews backs federal plan to boost migration – as it happened","trailText":"Follow the day’s news, live","byline":"Tory Shepherd (now) and Royce Kurmelovs (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62f8a6eb8f083b8f44400db4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-14T07:52:45.533Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What we learned today, Sunday 14 August.</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Today was not filled with good news, unfortunately.

ACCI chief executive officer, <strong>Andrew McKellar</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the global race to attract skilled migrants heats up, we cannot risk getting left behind. We must have efficient and cost-effective visa settings to attract and retain talent which will be crucial to strengthening our economic recovery in the years ahead.<br><br>Businesses of every size in every sector reporting significant barriers to getting the skilled workforce they need, forcing them to operate below capacity or close their doors entirely.</p> </blockquote> <p>He called for more resourcing of visa processing, to cut down wait times.<br><br>Skills minister <strong>Brendan O’Connor</strong> today pledged Labor would work to “unclog the application process”, but stopped short of promising more public servants behind desks approving visa forms. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What people should understand is when we talk about increasing the permanent migration skilled stream, we’re talking also about existing temporary visa applicants already in our labour market, but who have no security and no permanency when it comes to their status.</p> </blockquote> <p>That part of the equation would be “providing temporary visa holders a pathway to permanent residency”, he said.</p> <p>Australian Council of Trade Unions president, <strong>Michele O’Neil</strong>, flagged similar concerns, saying unions backed moves towards permanent migration rather than temporary migrants who might be paid less. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In many sectors wages have been kept low by unscrupulous employers who drive down wages and conditions for local and migrant workers by exploiting temporary workers who are fearful of speaking up because their visas are tied to their employment. This cannot continue.</p> <p>We support a system which provides genuine decent job opportunities and training for local workers and permanent migration.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e47d6450103982f1049cea4404ee38fc86aa7e33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e47d6450103982f1049cea4404ee38fc86aa7e33/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) president Michele O'Neil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) president Michele O'Neil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-14T07:46:32.290Z\">at 8.46am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62f8a28b8f086d0d751f1338\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-14T07:23:56.933Z\">8.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sean Davey</strong> brings you “healing cattle cuddles”: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The cows were really big, sweet animals that allowed me to hug them and lie down with them.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/14/these-cows-saved-my-life-the-queensland-farm-offering-healing-cattle-cuddles\">‘These cows saved my life’: the Queensland farm offering healing cattle cuddles</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62f89dbe8f086d0d751f1326\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-14T07:01:45.031Z\">8.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Services resume at Canberra airport after shooting incident</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to “normal” at <strong>Canberra airport</strong>: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CanberraAirport/status/1558707661473980417\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The airport has resumed normal operations.

It is the Brexit right’s Taliban-like belief in the righteousness of its cause that drives the party. To win, she has resolved to be its uncompromising representative, but her decision has not stopped there. The only way for a Tory leader to sustain the leadership of what is ever more obviously a deranged and factionalised political movement is to govern from the hard right. It will end in failure.</p> <p>The epicentre will be the economy. Her uncontroversial stated aim is growth of 2.5%. Consensus stops there. All the mechanisms to achieve growth are drawn from the evidence-free but prejudice-rich rightwing playbook – persistently anti-Europe, obsessed with tax cuts, buying into the faith that nameless regulations are shackling business and, above all, that a weak political class, deep state and obeisance to technocrats have combined to make Britain quasi-socialist – despite 12 years of Tory rule. Truss is the insurgent carrying the Thatcherite flame who will put the world to rights.</p> <p>Consider her six-point plan for growth. It starts, inevitably, with a commitment to cut taxes “now”. She will “unshackle business from burdensome regulation” buttressed by “supply-side reform”. She will “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/22/bonfire-of-rights-truss-vows-to-scrap-remaining-eu-laws-by-end-2023\" title=\"\">scrap all EU-derived laws by 2023</a>” and “work with industry leaders to regulate for British businesses and consumers”. She will “create low-tax, low-regulation investment zones”. And she will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/05/truss-irresponsible-for-threatening-to-review-bank-of-england-remit\" title=\"\">revisit the Bank of England’s mandate</a> so that it is better at managing inflation. It is ruinous nonsense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All the mechanisms to achieve growth are drawn from the evidence-free but prejudice-rich rightwing playbook</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Reality is not allowed a look-in. There is no recognition that what matters in a decade beset by a pandemic, climate breakdown, fragile energy markets and threats to food supplies is the resilience of a country’s energy, public health, water and farming systems to support business and civil society, in all of which the state has to play a leadership role. There is no comprehension that today’s economy is built on the “intangibles” of knowledge, intellectual property and digitisation for which smart regulation – not no regulation – is foundational.</p> <p>There is zero acceptance of the role of city regions as growth motors, set out in the government’s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/02/what-does-the-levelling-up-white-paper-say\" title=\"\">levelling up </a>white paper last December, and the vital institutions and processes that support great cities, again perforce led by the state. As British exports stagnate, there is not a nod to the role of trade as a propellant of growth. The UK, as the second largest exporter of services in the world – built on intangibles that sit behind sectors as diverse as finance and the creative industries – is locked out of the country’s largest markets in Europe. It is a growth plan built on sand.</p> <p>So, will revoking the remaining national insurance contribution hike (to pay for enlarging public health and social care capacity, recall) and stopping the planned corporation tax rise spur growth, at the same time retaining the four-year freeze on personal allowances, on which Truss is silent?</p> <p>Here, too, evidence is not allowed a look-in. Successive Tory chancellors – quasi-socialists in the absurd Truss story – have cut the UK corporation tax rate from 26% in 2010 to 19% today. Private business investment has remained stubbornly at the bottom of the G7. The key propellant of investment is not the corporation tax rate but the confidence that any investment will pay back, and in strategy-free Britain in the grip of rightwing ideology, cut off from its major market, there is little or no long-term confidence. Truss will forgo much needed tax revenue – and achieve nothing.</p> <p>Few directors of British PLCs have a good word for Brexit and the likelihood of trade war over the Northern Ireland protocol in private. The view is shared by the tens of thousands launching startups in an extraordinary entrepreneurial revolution centred around our 100 top universities, ranging from an Oxford that is very different to the one attended by Brexiters in the 1980s to centres of innovation such as Northumbria University.</p> <p>The Tory edifice is ignorant about this enterprise revolution. In their terms, these can’t be real entrepreneurs: they vote Labour, Lib Dem and Green, abhor Brexit, worry that the UK is being kicked out of the EU’s Horizon programme, prize universities, want action on climate change and, for the main part, can’t bear the Tory party, its press and freakish leading commentators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Truss will forgo much needed tax revenue – and achieve nothing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For what is shackling them is the lack of a British ecosystem that fosters growing companies – another deficiency that falls to the state to remedy – reinforced by trying to put the union jack on regulations and diverge from the regulatory standards in our biggest market. A classic example is the government insisting that the chemical industry should abandon its £500m-a year membership of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/eu-unveils-plan-largest-ever-ban-on-dangerous-chemicals\" title=\"\">EU chemical regulatory system,</a> which allows it to export to 27 EU countries and become tied to a £2bn UK-only programme, which allows it to trade in one country and not to the highest safety standards. In the 2020s, regulation is a way to guarantee product standards and win market access. Badging regulation British is an expensive means to suppress enterprise.</p> <p>Supply-side reforms? For Truss, they seem to consist of removing the vestigial remnants of employment protection in the least regulated labour market in the OECD, permitting fracking (a non-starter because Britain’s geology means the risks of damage and subsidence are extraordinarily high) and scrapping incentives to go green. Low-tax, low-regulation zones? As a wealth of evidence shows, these displace economic activity rather than create the new.</p> <p>Do the Tees Valley or the West Midlands want to become international showcases for industrial injury, tax avoidance and goods that are dangerous or just plain shoddy? As for blaming the Bank of England for inflation of 13%, get a life. If it had acted six to nine months earlier – which I recall almost no one urging at the time – inflation might be peaking at 12.5%.</p> <p>This is populist bullshit, unless Truss has the chutzpah to raise the inflation target to 4% for a period, an intriguing idea floated by the Bank’s former deputy governor Howard Davies. That is genuine outside-the-box thinking, rather than rehearsing tired Thatcherite nostrums.</p> <p>All the while, British households confront energy bills of up to £5,000 next year, unpayable by tens of millions – another reality ignored by the Truss camp.

Fact. These pots of scented wax also hold the power to conjure up memories of far-flung places. So if you’re not going on holiday this year – or simply working from home – a candle can make your surroundings lovelier. Which, again, makes you happy. So how to choose? Fragrance is subjective, but those reminiscent of garden ingredients work well in summer. Good candles are pricey (as my husband once said, it’s like burning money). But you get what you pay for. Pricier candles are formulated with high-quality wax and real perfume oils. Very cheap candles tend to include a lot of chemicals, which is why they can be headache/nausea-inducing. For affordable luxe, try Beauty Pie. Mini candles from brands such as Trudon are also a smart buy. And if you do decide to splurge don’t burn your candle for more than a few hours at a time. Otherwise you’ll get to the end of the wick very quickly. Which would really be like burning money.</p> <p><strong>1.

Doctors acted swiftly and she was given a hysterectomy followed by sessions of chemotherapy.</p> <p>But her cancer returned within a year. “I carry a mutated version of a gene known as BRCA1 which makes me susceptible to breast and ovarian cancers,” said Hayward, who works at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. “It runs in families. My mother died of cancer and we assume her mother did as well.”</p> <p>This time doctors turned to a new weapon in their anti-tumour armoury. After decades of research – much of it carried out in the UK – scientists have developed a range of drugs known as Parp inhibitors. “I was given more chemotherapy and then put on a daily regimen of a brand of Parp inhibitor pills known as olaparib. I have been clear of cancer ever since,” Hayward told the <em>Observer</em> last week.</p> <p>Nor is her story unique. Across the UK, increasing use of Parp inhibitors has raised hopes that many individuals susceptible to certain familial cancers can be treated simply and effectively in coming years. Indeed, it may be possible one day to use Parp inhibitors not just to treat patients after cancers appear but to prevent them from developing at all.</p> <p>“Effectively, Parp inhibitors would be used as a preventive medicine to stop certain tumours from ever appearing,” said Professor Herbie Newell, of Newcastle University. “We will have moved the battle against cancer on to a new footing.”</p> <p>Parp is short for poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase, an enzyme that is found in all our cells where it plays a key role in helping cells repair damaged DNA. A Parp inhibitor works as an anti-tumour treatment by stopping a cancer cell’s own Parp enzyme from doing its repair work and so causes it to die.</p> <p>“Unravelling the way that the Parp enzyme helps cells repair themselves led to the discovery of chemicals that could disrupt this process. This was the result of decades of basic research work in biology laboratories across the UK and that is what has led us to these new drugs,” said Newell.</p> <p>The clinical evaluation of the first Parp inhibitors began 20 years ago just as the funding charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) was formed out of an amalgamation of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and the Cancer Research Campaign. Since then the organisation has played a key role in funding research in the field.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3981ef05ffa5d7eb0128d6598117b7171070520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3981ef05ffa5d7eb0128d6598117b7171070520/0_77_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Hayward with her husband, Kieran, in the Lake District.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Hayward with her husband, Kieran, in the Lake District.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sent by her</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Essentially we have found the achilles heel of tumour cells and have learned how to use that information to destroy them,” said cancer expert Prof Steve Jackson of Cambridge University. His team of researchers – backed by CRUK funding – played a key role in the discovery and development of the Parp inhibitor olaparib.</p> <p>This work followed on from earlier research in the US and the UK that had revealed the existence of two genes – Breast Cancer 1 and Breast Cancer 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene) – which have mutated versions that increase a carrier’s risk of getting a number of cancers, including those of the breast, ovary and prostate. Each can be inherited from either parent and can spread through lineages with devastating effect.</p> <p>It is estimated that in the UK there are tens of thousands of people who carry pathogenic versions of the BRCA1 and BRCA 2 genes. For these individuals, the development of Parp inhibitors offers the prospect of protection against the raised cancer risks that they have inherited.</p> <p>“When we first developed Parp inhibitors we gave them to patients who were in the late stages of their cancers,” said Jackson. “They had nothing to lose. We were not sure what to expect but found there were quite a number of patients who responded quite profoundly.”</p> <p>Today, Parp inhibitors are being given earlier and earlier to cancer patients. “We are also seeing that a substantial fraction of these patients are surviving long term,” added Jackson. “One lady that I know, who was in late-stage cancer, started taking a Parp inhibitor nearly nine years ago and is now absolutely symptom-free.”</p> <p>And it is this progression to earlier administration of the drug that is now encouraging scientists to consider the use of Parp inhibitors such as olaparib in a preventive role. Individuals from families affected by mutated BRCA genes would be given these drugs before they had developed cancer.</p> <p>This could have considerable benefits. At present, women from affected families sometimes elect to have mastectomies or hysterectomies to prevent the onset of inherited breast or ovarian cancer. Regularly taking Parp inhibitors might prevent the need for such operations.</p> <p>“However, there are side effects involved in taking these drugs and it is now a matter of ongoing research to work out how we might balance the risk of those side effects with the potential benefit of preventing tumour development in the first place,” added Newell. “That is exactly the research question that is currently being addressed.”</p> <p>For her part, Sue Hayward said she had felt fatigued after taking the drug. “But I’ve become accustomed to it. At the end of the day, I just feel lucky that I have had access to a medicine like this.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/14/notes-on-chocolate-annalisa-barbieri-nutty-treats-with-unusual-extras","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:15:03Z","webTitle":"Notes on chocolate: nutty treats with all the extras","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/14/notes-on-chocolate-annalisa-barbieri-nutty-treats-with-unusual-extras","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/14/notes-on-chocolate-annalisa-barbieri-nutty-treats-with-unusual-extras","fields":{"headline":"Notes on chocolate: nutty treats with all the extras","trailText":"Unusual variations on a classic combination","byline":"Annalisa Barbieri","body":"<p>I cannot resist chocolate-covered nuts.

The Tory party hasn’t yet interrupted a boys’ poker night to weep about the death of a “<a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/kate-hudson-and-matthew-mcconaughey-celebrate-how-to-lose-a-guy-in-10-days-in-throwback-instagram-posts.html/\" title=\"\">love fern</a>”, but the way it is conducting its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/10/liz-truss-refuses-to-rule-out-help-with-energy-bills-in-apparent-u-turn-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">leadership contest</a> smacks of a similar desperation to be dumped by the electorate.</p> <p>Is this the How To Lose an Election Two Years Early guide? Are the insults flung between the camps the behaviour of a party that wants voters to have faith in it, when its leading lights don’t appear to have faith in each other? Is the power vacuum over the cost of living crisis just what has to happen while the leadership contest trundles on or a sign that everyone at the top, including the pair vying to take over, has little energy left and can’t be bothered to go all in to get a grip of the situation?</p> <p>Political parties exist to win power and get things done, but that doesn’t always mean they really want it. The Tories in the late 1990s were so exhausted and chaotic at the end of their lengthy spell in government that being chucked out of government almost seemed a kindness, like an elderly driver having their licence taken away after too many near misses. Labour visibly breathed a sigh of sad relief in 2010 when it lost that election – and so many of its senior figures today talk privately about how “we needed that time in opposition to regroup and work out what we stood for”.</p> <p>The Conservatives did, after Boris Johnson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-leads-tories-historic-general-election-win\" title=\"\">2019 victory</a>, believe that they had found the political alchemist’s dream of being able to regenerate while in government rather than doing so in opposition. Some among them think that’s still the case, with the contest unearthing new exciting faces such as Kemi Badenoch, Tom Tugendhat and Penny Mordaunt. They now hope to use that alchemy to win a historic fifth term in power. But the way they’re behaving at present suggests they’d privately quite like the next term to be from the comfort of opposition where they don’t have to take any difficult decisions for a while.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you’ve got a wound, you can cauterise it… Painful, but it probably works better than to leave the wound bleeding. We are bleeding.</p> <footer> <cite>Tory MP</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many Tory MPs are utterly bewildered by the twists and turns of the contest, wondering whether Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak want a functioning party that can govern for another two years and then win another election. One MP moans: “When you’ve got a wound, you can cauterise it, like Boris did with my colleagues who he kicked out in 2019 over Brexit. Painful, but it probably works better than the alternative, which is to leave the wound bleeding. We are bleeding.” The bleeding will continue long after the contest is over because Truss and Sunak have said enough about each other and their party’s record in government to keep Sir Keir Starmer from having to write any of his own criticisms this side of Christmas. Even before the battle narrowed down to the final two, other leadership hopefuls such as Badenoch and Mordaunt were providing the opposition with plenty of fodder by saying the public services the Conservatives have run for the past 12 years were in a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jul/15/tory-leadership-race-penny-mordaunt-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-debates-uk-politics-latest?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-62d15af98f08b970599b6d04\" title=\"\">desperate state</a>”. These are not the statements of people who see their party’s brand as the most precious thing.</p> <p>Even those who have declared their support for one of the pair aren’t sure if the Conservatives can regain their composure after this contest. Others who are publicly signed up to campaigns confess to me that they wish they could be a million miles away “from all this”. By “this”, they think they mean the gory leadership contest, but I wonder if they also mean from their party more generally, flailing about without ideas or motivation.</p> <p>Sunak certainly thinks there’s a risk this is true: he and his outriders in the media <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62430065\" title=\"\">keep warning</a> that picking Truss will consign the party to opposition. They argue that voters will not forgive the Conservatives for focusing on tax cuts above more effective measures for dealing with rampant inflation. If his analysis of Truss’s pitch as being merely what Tory members want to hear is correct, then the fact that she is frontrunner would suggest that the party membership are less into winning than they’ve been for a long time, too. Sunak chose to speak to the country first, rather than the party, and that gamble looks likely to fail. One of his supporters suggests that the post-mortem examination of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/23/rishi-sunak-vows-uk-crisis-footing-becomes-pm\" title=\"\">Ready for Rishi! campaign</a> would also be that of the Tories’ next election victory because it would suggest that the party has retreated into a comfort zone of going for what it, not the electorate, wants.</p> <p>Other Tory MPs – not only those backing Truss – argue that Sunak’s failure shows that the party has had enough of technocrats and unpleasant backroom behaviour. The “technocrat” accusation is levelled not just at Sunak, who is not a very political politician, but also at the advisers he has working with him. The figures in the shadows who have been twisting MPs’ arms to get them to support Sunak also include Gavin Williamson, who enjoyed being chief whip a little too much when he held the position a few years ago. Johnson’s camp mutter that the sunny and personable Sunak is more aware of the arm-twisting than he will admit – though they remain deeply embittered at the way the former chancellor dramatically quit the government and contributed to the prime minister’s departure. Then again, the Truss campaign insists it is only offering a positive vision, while at the same time trying to come up with a new insult for Sunak. The most amusing in recent days was that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/09/liz-truss-declines-to-commit-on-help-for-energy-bills-at-tory-hustings\" title=\"\">like Gordon Brown</a>: a comparison that would seem ludicrous at any time but particularly in the week that the former prime minister was the only one who had anything of interest to say about the scale of the cost of living crisis and also about what a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/10/gordon-brown-says-energy-firms-unable-to-offer-lower-bills-should-be-temporarily-re-nationalised\" title=\"\">commensurate response</a> might be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Truss campaign insists it is only offering a positive vision, while at the same time trying to come up with a new insult for Sunak</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brown’s repeated interventions last week showed up Starmer, who has been absent from the debates over the cost of living. The Labour leader has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/10/as-cost-of-living-crisis-hits-politicians-take-a-long-break-to-recharge\" title=\"\">on holiday</a>, but it’s not clear whether returning from a break will mean he suddenly displays hitherto hidden levels of political courage and creativity. The holiday wasn’t really the problem: Starmer’s caution was there long before he packed his suitcase. The leadership contest has given him the perfect space to step up, saying the Tories are too small-minded and preoccupied with themselves to offer the big solutions this country needs. But as one Truss backer says: “It shows how useless Labour are that the one with all the ideas is the guy who was the worst effing prime minister this country has ever seen.”</p> <p>Starmer has spent the past few months “framing” various issues ahead of a party conference where his allies hope he will show he’s really got what it takes to win voters over. Currently, the electorate seem to be still in the position of Matthew McConaughey’s character Benjamin Barry, who tries to stick to the bet he’s made to make a girl fall in love with him within 10 days, even though she is doing everything she can to throw him off the scent. Labour is only a few points ahead in the polls, despite the Tories having tantrums that Hollywood directors would think unrealistic. And Starmer seems to be satisfied that he’s shown enough boldness merely by doing the very necessary detoxifying work within his party, including booting out Jeremy Corbyn. That’s not enough to make voters fall for your party after its own long spell of behaving badly.</p> <p>Any romcom worth its salt, including <em>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</em>, concludes with a chase, preferably in a car, with one of the leading characters realising they’ve made a terrible mistake in ditching the other. There will be no such feelgood plot twist in September once this contest is over. The new leader will not have the time or political space to do a kiss-and-make-up tour. “We aren’t going to get a honeymoon, a mini-moon or even a candlelit dinner,” says one minister. “It is going to be extremely tough straight away.” The Tories dismiss Brown as the leader who took the Labour party back into its preferred state of opposition. But in fairness to the former prime minister, he did everything he could to stop the financial system collapsing. It’s not clear that the Conservative party will put in the same level of effort into the current economic crisis or, indeed, to winning the next election.</p> <p>• Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/14/nabil-fekir-i-was-a-kid-in-lyon-who-only-thought-about-having-fun-on-the-pitch","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"Nabil Fekir: ‘I was a kid in Lyon who only thought about having fun on the pitch’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/nabil-fekir-i-was-a-kid-in-lyon-who-only-thought-about-having-fun-on-the-pitch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/14/nabil-fekir-i-was-a-kid-in-lyon-who-only-thought-about-having-fun-on-the-pitch","fields":{"headline":"Nabil Fekir: ‘I was a kid in Lyon who only thought about having fun on the pitch’","trailText":"The Real Betis forward talks to Sid Lowe about being fouled all the time, choosing France over Algeria and the aborted transfer to Liverpool","byline":"Sid Lowe","body":"<p>Nabil Fekir strolls through the door wearing shorts and sliders and settles into a chair, tucking Europe’s most punished limbs under the table.

A first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/real-betis-valencia-copa-del-rey-final-match-report\">Copa del Rey win</a> for Betis in 17 years, only their fourth trophy ever – “a wonderful night” – and a goal direct from a corner against Sevilla, entirely deliberate but taken from him when the match was abandoned. “He has personality; he’s a simple guy who doesn’t go about with the fantasy of being the star. He listens and improves,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/manuel-pellegrini-if-i-had-another-life-i-wouldnt-dedicate-it-to-football\">Pellegrini said as Betis prepared for that final</a>. “And the thing is, playing comes so easily to him. He’s a pleasure to coach and I don’t understand why he’s not at a really huge club because he certainly deserves it.”</p> <p>It was a line that demanded an obvious question and, in turn, an equally obvious response, Pellegrini cracking up. Do you tell him that? Do you say you should be at Barcelona or Bayern or City or somewhere? “No, because I don’t want him to leave Betis.”</p> <p>Nor does anyone else. There is something about Fekir that is different but fits with the philosophy of a club that embraces enjoyment, one of La Liga’s great attractions as a new season begins. With him football is more fun, that’s for sure. But what about <em>for </em>him? This can be a suffocatingly serious business, after all. A painful one too, he knows. “Fun? Yes, yes, always,” he says softly, unhurried, which is how he says most things. “There’s pressure, it can depend on the moments, but if you don’t enjoy it …”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8e5921020cbc006f181806d14fdf20f08de2add\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8e5921020cbc006f181806d14fdf20f08de2add/1043_0_2444_3000/815.jpg\" alt=\"Nabil Fekir with the Copa del Rey\" width=\"815\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fekir helped Real Betis win the Copa del Rey for only the club’s fourth trophy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a pause. Fekir sits on a terrace outside St George’s Park, where Betis are completing pre-season preparation the morning after a win over their fellow residents Marseille in Chesterfield of all places, a “friendly” that ended with a 20-man pile-in. “Look, I don’t <em>need</em> to play,” he continues. “For me it’s a game, a pleasure, and I hope to continue this way. I play like I did as a kid. The only thing that changes is experience: I’m 29, I’m not going to play exactly like at 19. I run with my head, but in essence I haven’t changed.”</p> <p>Two of Fekir’s brothers play amateur football while Yassin, four years his junior, is in the Betis B team. “I think he’s <em>very</em> good, eh!” he says. “I don’t know if I’m objective but he’s very good. He’s like me, but right footed. My dad worked in a metal factory. My mum worked in a nursery, looking after kids. They always said to work hard at school. All that was in my head was football. And, thank God, I got there.”</p> <p>If you hadn’t? “I don’t know. There was only one thought: be a footballer. And after I retire, I honestly don’t know what I will do. I can’t see myself as a coach, but players always say that and then they get there … it’s because we really like football. We’ve spent our whole lives in football and then we don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’ll still be playing at 41, like Joaquín but I’d like to. We all would. For now, I play: but the day will come.</p> <p>“I was a humble kid in Lyon who only thought about having fun on the pitch with my friends. I wanted to win but without asking questions or wondering what would become of me. We played in the neighbourhood – and I think that’s why I have a game that’s ‘street’.” </p> <p>It is a profile that is being lost. “Yeah, could be,” Fekir says. “When you go to an academy, there’s a lot of structure. I played more in local teams where coaches let you do what you want; that gives you a freedom which has been important to me.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7a274cc1286219ac3fe86a5c311bf267475668e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7a274cc1286219ac3fe86a5c311bf267475668e/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nabil Fekir playing for Lyon in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fekir initially joined the academy of Lyon at the age of 12.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Foudrot/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fekir did join the academy at Lyon aged 12 – “It was very hard at first” – but left again two years later. “I don’t remember why, there wasn’t a specific reason. And four years later they rang again.” What had changed? “I don’t know. Maybe they realised they made a mistake. I left, went to local teams. It’s all good. I wasn’t angry, because I love football. It didn’t matter if it was Lyon or some other club; I just wanted to play. I went to a neighbourhood club and enjoyed it a lot.”</p> <p>Fekir would end up as captain of a talented emerging Lyon team – Memphis Depay, Samuel Umtiti, Anthony Martial – and a call came from France’s senior setup the very same international break in which he had first been chosen for the Algeria squad. “That was very hard for me,” he says. “My dad arrived in France the year before I was born; my mum is Algerian but had been there longer. Every year or so I would go to Algeria. I feel French and Algerian.”</p> <p>Are there people who don’t understand that? Who are a bit … Fekir completes the question: “… closed? Yes. Yes. And that does complicate things. Some people don’t understand that you can have dual nationality, can love two countries at once, you know? It was difficult for me. I was young. A lot of people saying France, a lot saying Algeria. Eventually I chose France but those were very, very hard moments. That’s life. I don’t regret anything I did.”</p> <p>The first person Fekir told was his father. “He didn’t want it. That’s normal. I understand that perfectly. He has all his family there, he grew up there. His whole life there. It hurt him a bit when I chose France. But that’s life: there are decisions, and that was mine. I take responsibility.”</p> <p>And now you are a world champion.</p> <p>There’s a smile. “Not bad.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"798529d18fc2b597faba8a46432518a3b110ffbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/798529d18fc2b597faba8a46432518a3b110ffbc/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nabil Fekir celebrates winning the World Cup with his France teammates in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nabil Fekir celebrates winning the World Cup with his France teammates in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Faith is important to me: everything is in God’s hands so I don’t worry,” Fekir says. About anything? “Anything.” Including the move to Liverpool that fell through in the summer of 2018. The suggestion was that Fekir had failed a medical because of a knee problem, but he says that is wrong. He also rejects accusations from the agent Jean Pierre Bernès that it collapsed because of his family’s involvement.</p> <p>“I had a problem with my agent, that’s it. Very simple. Things were not clear, you know. Between him and me. I don’t want to go into details but it was a problem between my agent and I. People then said it was my knee or I-don’t-know-what but that’s just an excuse. I know what really happened.”</p> <p>Another smile. “He’s no longer my agent.”</p> <p>“I believe in destiny, you know. If I didn’t sign for Liverpool, it’s because Betis were here waiting for me. It’s a lovely city, with that Arabic spirit, a special club. It’s life. I don’t regret anything. I don’t think about the future much. I just live every day and try to enjoy it, <em>play</em>.” Even if they do kick him all the way.</p> <p><em>• Watch LaLiga this season <a href=\"https://premiersports.com/subscribenow\">on Premier Sports</a>.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/14/10-best-floating-hotels-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Water beds: the UK’s 10 best floating hotels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/14/10-best-floating-hotels-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/14/10-best-floating-hotels-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"Water beds: the UK’s 10 best floating hotels","trailText":"Stow away on an ark, a converted ferry or houseboat and be lulled to sleep by the lapping waves","byline":"Sarah Turner","body":"<h2>The Floathouse Amelie, Cornwall</h2> <p>This three-cabin houseboat on the Penryn River near Falmouth aims to be a supremely relaxing perch for its guests.

It just chills you to think about.”</p> <p>The murders were discovered on the morning of 22 April 2016, when Bobby Jo Manley stopped by the Rhodens’ cluster of trailer homes to see her ex-brother-in-law, Chris Rhoden Sr. Entering his trailer, she found the bloody bodies of Chris and his cousin, Gary. Chris’s ex-wife, Dana, was dead nearby, as were their children – Hanna, Chris Jr and Clarence, known as “Frankie” – and Frankie’s fiancee, Hannah Gilley.</p> <p>The same day, Chris Sr’s brother Kenneth Rhoden, who lived about 15 minutes away, was also found murdered.</p> <p>The killer or killers had spared Frankie’s three-year-old son; Frankie and Hannah Gilley’s baby, who was found covered in blood, trying to nurse at his mother; and Hanna Rhoden’s newborn. (Hanna and Jake’s two-year-old daughter, the subject of the custody dispute, was staying elsewhere.)</p> <p>Chris Rhoden’s pit bulls were also alive and unharmed, a fact that struck many in the community as significant. Dana Rhoden’s father, Leonard Manley, <a href=\"https://www.wcpo.com/news/crime/prosecutors-lay-out-possible-new-evidence-in-pike-county-massacre-trial\">told</a> reporters, “Whoever done it know’d the family because there were two dogs there that would eat you up, but I ain’t gonna say no more.”</p> <p>As shock and paranoia rippled through Pike county, investigators from a multitude of law enforcement agencies descended on the Rhodens’ properties to try to deconstruct the grisly crime scenes.

They describe Jake Wagner as a frightening man who fathered a child with an underage girl and stalked her when she tried to escape his control, and his family as a cultish clan who reacted to a perceived slight with extreme violence.</p> <p>Jake Wagner allegedly began a relationship with Hanna Rhoden when she was 13, impregnating her when she was 15 and he was 20. In addition to homicide, he has been charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.</p> <p>After she ended the relationship, prosecutors say, he began threatening her. When she had a second child with a different man, Wagner allegedly pressured her to falsely list him as father on the birth certificate. He and his brother George were also allegedly stalking two other women – their respective ex-wives, both of whom are expected to testify that the Wagners made them fear for their lives.</p> <p>When Hanna Rhoden refused to relinquish custody of the baby she had had with Jake Wagner, the Wagners were enraged. Jake Wagner allegedly threatened to kill her, but she was determined not to give up her child. In a message on Facebook, she <a href=\"https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/jake-wagner-back-in-pike-county-court-for-sudden-hearing\">wrote</a> that she would “never sign papers ever. They will have to kill me first.”</p> <p>That was when the Wagners allegedly decided to eliminate Hanna and her relatives so that custody of the child would fall to them. They allegedly bought ammunition, parts for silencers, “brass catchers” to avoid leaving bullet casings behind, and a truck and shoes specifically to use on the night of the killings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"573d32515f0426a6dba81957c085d4ed05216f49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/573d32515f0426a6dba81957c085d4ed05216f49/0_148_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Wagner IV, center, is escorted out of the courtroom after his arraignment at the Pike county courthouse, in Waverly, Ohio, in November 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Wagner IV, center, is escorted out of the courtroom after his arraignment at the Pike county courthouse, in Waverly, Ohio, in November 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert McGraw/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They <a href=\"https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/Special-Prosecutions/PikeCountyMurderIndictments.aspx\">surveilled</a> the Rhodens to study their habits and sleeping locations, according to an indictment, then killed them under cover of darkness and tried to make the murders appear drug-related.</p> <p>The crime scene, or scenes, were so complicated that investigators carted away the Rhodens’ trailers whole to preserve their evidence. Even with the assistance of numerous law enforcement agencies, the investigation was daunting in scope.</p> <p>The Wagners were arrested in 2018, after police allegedly discovered homemade silencer parts and other incriminating evidence on the family’s former property.</p> <p>In hearings, prosecutors have described the Wagner family as a “criminal enterprise”. The Wagners’ lawyers have tried to fight that narrative.</p> <p>“A large part of the state’s argument we anticipate is: ‘He’s a Wagner, and this is how the Wagners operate,’” an attorney for George Wagner IV <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/07/30/rhoden-family/\">said</a> in a hearing. “The jury needs to understand the basic premise of our criminal justice system is as follows: our law punishes people for what they do, not [for] who they are.”</p> <p>Jury selection for George Wagner IV’s trial began this week in Pike county. His attorneys have argued that it will be difficult to get a fair trial there, given the media attention the case has attracted, the small jury pool, and the fact that many residents have personal connections to the victims or alleged perpetrators. A judge declined an initial request to relocate the trial, pending the outcome of jury selection.</p> <p>As part of the deal that Jake Wagner struck with prosecutors, his family members will also avoid the death penalty. Given the weight of evidence, it seems unlikely that any of the main defendants will ever see the outside of a prison again.</p> <p>Allen, the Cincinnati defense attorney, predicts “a guilty finding on every one of them”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/14/from-bats-to-beavers-five-mammals-that-live-by-uk-waterways","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"From bats to beavers: five mammals that live by UK waterways","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/14/from-bats-to-beavers-five-mammals-that-live-by-uk-waterways","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/14/from-bats-to-beavers-five-mammals-that-live-by-uk-waterways","fields":{"headline":"From bats to beavers: five mammals that live by UK waterways","trailText":"Holidaying by a river?

It lives around rivers, streams, ponds and lakes – and in marshes and moorland. Look out for riverbank burrows with a nibbled “lawn” of grass around the entrance – a sure sign that there are water voles around.</p> <h2>Beavers: back from extinction</h2> <p>After a 400-year absence after being hunted to extinction, Britain’s largest rodent has been reintroduced. The size of a tubby spaniel, the beaver lives in freshwater habitats and builds dams. It is most visible at dusk and dawn.</p> <h2>Bats: seasonal sightings</h2> <p>There are 18 bat species living in the UK. In summer they come out of hibernation, hunt insects, give birth and raise their young. They can be found all over the country – particularly in warm weather and near water with insects to prey on.</p> <h2>Otters: waterway predators</h2> <p>An elusive waterway predator, the British otter is widespread but rare. Head to the rivers and wetlands of Scotland, west Wales, the West Country or East Anglia for the best chance of sighting one. Keep an eye out for five-toed footprints (6-7cm long) and droppings in prominent places left as messages on the ground.</p> <h2>Rats: urban warriors</h2> <p>Strong swimmers, rats can often be spotted around waterways, particularly in urban areas where there’s an easy supply of food. They’re unpopular creatures, but surely you’d rather see one of the UK’s estimated 150m wild rats swimming in a canal than in your bathtub…</p> <p><em>For more information, visit the <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer\">Wildlife Trust</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/14/four-books-about-life-on-britains-rivers-and-canals","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"The life aquatic: four books about life on Britain’s rivers and canals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/14/four-books-about-life-on-britains-rivers-and-canals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/14/four-books-about-life-on-britains-rivers-and-canals","fields":{"headline":"The life aquatic: four books about life on Britain’s rivers and canals","trailText":"Immerse yourself in real-life adventures from Britain’s canals","byline":"Genevieve Fox","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5c53afa15d918ae8aa633cc97af066a51951e53d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c53afa15d918ae8aa633cc97af066a51951e53d/0_0_1521_2337/651.jpg\" alt=\"Maidens' Trip cover image copy\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/maidens-trip-9781408801253\" title=\"\">Maidens’ Trip</a>: A Wartime Adventure on the Grand Union Canal</h2> <p>When three 18-year-old “maidens”, including author Emma Smith, sign up for canal boating as part of the war effort in 1943, they transport steel to Birmingham, coal from Coventry, lose their bicycles and find a cat – and themselves. <em>(Bloomsbury, £10.99)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9511b36251a8f8a2546c0cda4ee55bc4e4a3eef8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9511b36251a8f8a2546c0cda4ee55bc4e4a3eef8/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Tales from the Tillerman\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/search.php?search_query=Tales+from+the+Tillerman\" title=\"\">Tales from the Tillerman</a>: A Lifelong Love Affair with Britain’s Waterways</h2> <p>Seasoned water rat Steve Haywood combines a history of Britain’s canals with 50 years of anecdotes and lively rants about his own water escapades and the changes in the cruising landscape he has encountered on the way. <em>(Adlard Coles, £12.99)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bf5a1718982d10c093ac33c9359e2923324c81c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf5a1718982d10c093ac33c9359e2923324c81c3/0_0_2953_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waterways Past and Present 9781472912015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/waterways-past-present-9781472912015\" title=\"\">Waterways Past &amp; Present</a>: A thousand miles along Britain’s canals</h2> <p>Slow adventurer Jasper Winn spent a tranquil year exploring Britain’s waterways on foot and by bike and boats.

It’s particularly important because during drought, additional mains water is drawn from wild sources, affecting struggling wildlife. Here are some of the things you can do.</p> <h2><strong>Be realistic</strong></h2> <p>In times of drought there will be losses. To save water and sanity, prioritise plants to keep and plants to lose. Anything easy to grow from seed or cutting should be left and grown again next year.</p> <h2><strong>Create a plant ark</strong></h2> <p>Although Noah had excess water, he could only fit two of each species in the ark. If you have repeats of perennials, focus on saving one of each to divide or take cuttings from next spring, and sacrifice the rest (Biblical references end here).</p> <h2><strong>Use trays</strong></h2> <p>Place dishes, plates, oven trays, anything you can find under all plant pots, saving every drop.</p> <h2><strong>Utilise shade</strong></h2> <p>Reduce watering needs by moving pots to shady areas. Sun-loving plants will easily survive a few weeks like this. Drape shade netting over plants in the ground during the hottest times and over polytunnels and greenhouses (shade paint can be used on the latter).</p> <h2><strong>What about vegetables?</strong></h2> <p>If you’ve lovingly nurtured a tomato plant and it’s in the middle of cropping, pop it on the save list. Consider sacrificing less nutritional, water-guzzling edibles such as lettuce.</p> <h2><strong>Water deeply and mulch</strong></h2> <p>Rather than a little water every day, soak plants weekly to lock moisture deep into the soil and add a layer of compost on top to lock it in. Watch for plants wilting in the morning or evening as these are desperate for water. Plants wilting in the day can be misleading because it’s usually a natural response to heat, bouncing back as temperatures cool.</p> <h2><strong>Soapy water</strong></h2> <p>Organic gardeners may be reluctant to use dishwater on plants, especially those you eat, but during drought needs must. A 100% natural washing-up liquid helps for ornamental plants, saving clean water for edibles. Try not to use very soapy water on plants except in pots, they’ll be fine, but it can alter the composition of soil, having an unknown impact on vital microscopic soil life.</p> <h2><strong>Is it OK if lawns go totally brown?</strong></h2> <p>Lawn grasses evolved to survive drought by going dormant. Your lawn may look dead but it will make a miraculous recovery. Avoid wear and tear, and reseed worn patches in autumn. You can use soapy washing-up water on lawns but it’s a drop in a desert, best to save for other plants.</p> <h2><strong>Can I ease off watering houseplants?</strong></h2> <p>If your houseplant is a succulent or cactus, stop watering immediately. They’re built for drought. Leafier houseplants can suffer in scorching sun without enough water, move them away from windows a little to reduce water needs until the drought is over. Some, like ficus, may resent the move and shed some leaves, but will recover.</p> <h2><strong>Time for change</strong></h2> <p>Observe which plants suffer most in the drought and think about replacing them with plants that seem happier. Drought-tolerant plants include hylotelephium, achillea, fennel, rosemary, sage, salvias, meadow wildflowers and the ornamental grass Jarava ichu.</p> <h2><strong>Plant in the ground</strong></h2> <p>If you have lots of pots it’s far easier to grow plants in the ground. Roots will spread further and deeper for water.</p> <h2><strong>Prepare for next time</strong></h2> <p>Strike while the ground is hot, attach a water butt or tank to your drainpipes now, increasing your rain harvest for future droughts.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/14/richard-thompson-in-tray-key-tasks-for-ecb-chair-cricket-in-turmoil","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Richard Thompson’s in-tray: key tasks for ECB chair with cricket in turmoil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/14/richard-thompson-in-tray-key-tasks-for-ecb-chair-cricket-in-turmoil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/14/richard-thompson-in-tray-key-tasks-for-ecb-chair-cricket-in-turmoil","fields":{"headline":"Richard Thompson’s in-tray: key tasks for ECB chair with cricket in turmoil","trailText":"From appointing a new chief executive to mending the rifts caused by the Hundred, there is plenty for the new man to do","byline":"Ali Martin","body":"<p>The appointment of Richard Thompson as chair of the England and Wales Cricket Board after a successful spell at Surrey brings with it a sense of cautious optimism when the sport faces significant challenges on a number of fronts. Though Thompson does not officially start a five-year term until 1 September, there is plenty waiting for the 55-year-old in his in-tray. What are the most pressing items?</p> <h2>Appoint a new chief executive and review the ECB</h2> <p>Thompson fills only part of the leadership vacuum at the ECB, with a permanent chief executive still required after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/17/tom-harrison-steps-down-as-ecb-chief-executive-cricket-england\" title=\"\">Tom Harrison signed off</a> in May and Clare Connor took the reins temporarily.</p> <p>It is inevitable Richard Gould, Thompson’s chief executive at Surrey, will be linked given the success the pair had in turning the county into a financial powerhouse with a growing membership. Whether Gould can be tempted back into cricket after moving to Bristol City last year is another matter.</p> <p>Johnny Grave, in charge at Cricket West Indies, and Wasim Khan, now at the International Cricket Council, would be strong candidates, while Tim Bostock, the chief executive of Durham, is highly regarded. Others will emerge when Thompson begins a process that is top of his to-do list.</p> <p>Though the ECB is financially strong, there is an expectation its structures will be reviewed, both culturally and with regards to its current, some would say bloated, size. The ECB averaged 458 employees during the year 2021-22 with an annual payroll of £54m, up from 221 and £21m respectively in the space of a decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"363f00998406ff6ecac6368b7bdfc92ca4701c8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363f00998406ff6ecac6368b7bdfc92ca4701c8d/0_0_5037_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Thompson speaks during Surrey’s AGM in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Thompson speaks during Surrey’s AGM in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Hoskins/Getty Images for Surrey CCC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The makeup of the ECB board from which Thompson stood down in 2018 will probably also be assessed in light of last year’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/20/england-pull-out-of-next-months-cricket-tours-of-pakistan\" title=\"\">aborted tour of Pakistan</a>, the (mis)handling of the Yorkshire affair and concerns over a lack of cricket experience. A voice for the domestic game is set to return, at least, with two first-class chairs to attend board meetings in a non-voting capacity from next month.</p> <h2>The ICEC report and EDI</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest iceberg on the horizon comes when the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket publishes its report on discrimination this autumn.</p> <p>In response to the fallout from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/nov/16/azeem-rafiqs-testimony-exposes-how-power-works-in-cricket-and-in-britain\" title=\"\">Azeem Rafiq’s allegations of racism</a> at Yorkshire, the English game has already set in motion a 12-point plan to tackle racism and promote inclusion and diversity, with a focus on education, dressing room culture, talent pathways and governance.</p> <p>However, the ICEC is reviewing more than 4,000 submissions of evidence from all levels of the pyramid and though conclusions are yet to be formed, a damning verdict is expected after Cindy Butts, its chair, said the sport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/cricket-is-facing-a-reckoning-chair-of-icec-says-major-change-needed\" title=\"\">is “facing a reckoning”</a>.</p> <p>Thompson’s successes at Surrey include stewardship of the African-Caribbean engagement programme and he has stated he will work tirelessly to make cricket “the most inclusive sport in the country”.</p> <p>The ECB’s response to the ICEC report will be among the first stress tests of this pledge, as well as the disciplinary proceedings that resulted from the Yorkshire situation and are likely to come to a head around the same time.</p> <h2>The Hundred</h2> <p>Thompson voted against the Hundred as Surrey chair but will now lead a governing body that has locked in the tournament’s future until 2028, with an extension to the Sky deal. Only the terrestrial rights from 2025 onwards are outstanding.</p> <p>As such, he will need to make the Hundred work and find a way to heal the obvious division it has sown. Even as a champion of the counties, his stated desire for “collaboration” and “partnership” will be challenged significantly.</p> <p>There are positives. The women’s game has been handed a fitting stage – notwithstanding the wage gap – and there has been some early evidence to suggest a new (or at least previously lapsed) audience has been energised by the heavy lick of marketing paint and terrestrial coverage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b19ab05bc20e2c4681f7ade61eda0bd0dbacfdae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b19ab05bc20e2c4681f7ade61eda0bd0dbacfdae/0_238_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trent Rockets’ Alana King celebrates her hat-trick in the Hundred against Manchester Originals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trent Rockets’ Alana King celebrates her hat-trick in the Hundred against Manchester Originals. The increased spotlight for the women’s game is one of the positives of the tournament, but there are divisions that need to be healed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Kruger/ECB/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But anger remains, with English cricket having twisted itself into a pretzel for a tournament that was supposed to promote the entire sport. The previously thriving T20 Blast has been squeezed, the Royal London Cup devalued and the County Championship still a predominantly spring/autumn endeavour; any new converts via the Hundred find themselves walking into a bitter, unresolved argument.</p> <p>Greater alignment of the short-form competitions appears essential, such as more player deals in the Hundred being contingent on performances in the Blast. Thompson will also need to address concerns about the financial imbalance of staging revenues for host counties, worth up to £800,000 a year.</p> <p>Then there is the question of whether the ECB will resist or embrace investment into the Hundred from outside as the Indian Premier League team owners build empires. It is a weighty decision given there will be no way of putting the toothpaste back in the tube once private money enters the equation.</p> <h2>The high performance review</h2> <p>While the Hundred’s continuation appears assured, there is further fear and loathing in the shires about the high performance review chaired by Andrew Strauss and, chiefly, talk of a cut to the County Championship.</p> <p>Could counties have their current 14 red-ball fixtures (down from 16 in 2016) become 12 or even just 10? Nothing has been decided and the review will only provide recommendations for the future domestic structure; any changes would still have to be approved by 12 of the 18 first-class chairs in September.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it is unlikely to conclude the status quo is working for all and Strauss has gone on record to state that the recent uptick from England’s men in Test cricket has not remotely diminished the need for reform. Thompson, who has sat on the review, said in the past: “We can’t allow red-ball cricket to become diminished any further.” Whatever the next configuration, he is expected to increase centralised promotion of the county competitions to ensure the Hundred isn’t the only shop window.</p> <h2>The global game</h2> <p>Thompson’s tenure comes at a time of existential angst for the sport worldwide. The rise of domestic T20 leagues (including the expansion of the Indian Premier League) and annual global events are shrinking opportunities for bilateral international cricket. Like the extension to Sky’s coverage of English cricket, the future tours programme for the 2023-27 period has been agreed before Thompson’s start date, however, and means the two spheres are vying for players and space. What shape the sport emerges in at the end of this period is the big question. The recent decision by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/18/ben-stokes-to-retire-from-odi-cricket-after-durham-farewell-appearance\" title=\"\">Ben Stokes to retire</a> from ODI cricket, Trent Boult stepping away from his New Zealand contract and South Africa cancelling an ODI series in Australia to stage their new T20 league in January have all highlighted the tension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70cd94b20b3bd247d00ea4cd96960d997be4172e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70cd94b20b3bd247d00ea4cd96960d997be4172e/0_0_3000_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Holden of Middlesex during the Vitality Blast match against Surrey this summer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Holden of Middlesex during the Vitality Blast match against Surrey this summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ICC seldom leads on such matters but as the representative of the ECB, one of the more powerful member boards, Thompson is among those charged with forging a balanced, more equitable landscape that prevents cricket from cannibalising itself and protects the primary of Test cricket.</p> <p>Thompson may also wish to assess England’s central contracts system for the men’s and women’s teams to ensure they adequately reflect this.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/14/when-things-are-not-ok-friends-offer-help-heres-how-to-do-it","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"When things are not OK, friends offer help.

We stepped into a lift and we started falling. A rip opened in the fabric of the kitchen and suddenly we were in a hushed side-world of hospitals and rage, trying desperately to find our way home. We woke one day with a new language, one that hurt our throats to speak.</p> <p>If you’re lucky and loved, when something like this happens, and you eventually tell your friends, they ask if there’s anything they can do.</p> <p>Is there anything they can do? It’s a really kind question.

You can go into your shed with a welding iron and invent two dystopic mechanisms of time travel which will allow us to move backwards rather than forwards, and then to sit with each other as if on a beach, in the moments, minutes and hours when everything was all right and everything was the old normal rather than this one, this desolate desert of gravel and bad news.</p> <p>You can find a little portal, so if we are forced to continue on this badly lit and treacherous timeline, we can at least do so without the added complication of little children and their feelings.

Can you make morning come faster or night go slower? Can you transform sleep into water? Instead of this forest, this grim plod through the dark, please can you turn sleep into a hotel pool off season, where, on a lilo the shape of a croissant, we can emptily float?</p> <p>Here’s what you can do – you can be perfect, please. That’s all I can tell you – just respond to me perfectly. Just: be flawless. In your texts, on the phone, in the faces you make. I don’t know what it looks like until I see its opposite, and I apologise in advance for the noise I will make. Sometimes I am happy to be distracted by the new problem with your sink or boss, but sometimes I feel as if I am too far away to hear it as words so it lands instead as rain or hail – you can give me a moment to translate. Rather than sympathy, bring me instead your best, richest gossip, a secret made of sex and betrayal with an accessible celebrity and ask nothing of me but a gasp as you remove its silver cloche.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am made of crepe paper right now. I am made of gum. I can withstand only two things: gossip and perfection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am made of crepe paper right now. I am made of gum. I can withstand only two things: gossip and perfection – liquids will destroy me, the wrong word will stick to my wrists and my chest and anywhere weak. But ha – if you avoid me of course, if you avoid this lumpen pain I’m carrying in front of me as if a screaming baby, knowing how delicate I am and the flawlessness required, I will resent you for ever. There is no way to win, I’m afraid, this is where we are, sorry.</p> <p>What you can do is stretch the internet to accommodate the depths I try every day to scroll, down through the grass of it, down through the earth, down through the roots of Instagram, hungrily looking for a diversion. While you’re in there, perhaps you could put up a series of impenetrable barriers too, so that I am not confronted with past Google searches or old photographs, or other traps newly spring-loaded to cause pain. You can trick me gently – alternately load me with work and responsibilities and then, at my sigh, abruptly take it all away, usher the children over to the telly or call my boss, and lie me very still by a window to look at the wind.</p> <p>Time passes oddly in a crisis. Is there anything you can do? Once, years ago in hospital, there was a clock by my bed that didn’t tick. Instead its arms would sweep forward to the correct position at two or three minute intervals, like somebody dragging themselves out of the sea. Now, a day will creep past, and a night will rush, and a weekend will slither over us wetly. It would be useful maybe, to see time at home pass like it does in those dense hospital hours. Can you get me that cursed clock?</p> <p>And if not, then fine, a lasagne.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/14/edinburgh-notebook-rik-mayall-was-like-bad-santa-to-us","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Edinburgh notebook: ‘Rik Mayall was like Bad Santa to us’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/edinburgh-notebook-rik-mayall-was-like-bad-santa-to-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/14/edinburgh-notebook-rik-mayall-was-like-bad-santa-to-us","fields":{"headline":"Edinburgh notebook: ‘Rik Mayall was like Bad Santa to us’","trailText":"Stand-up comic Red Richardson on his pedigree comedy childhood","byline":"Vanessa Thorpe","body":"<p>Driving Rik Mayall around would be entertaining work for anyone, but for the young Red Richardson, the job he had in his 20s was the continuation of a childhood bond.</p> <p>Mayall, who died suddenly in 2014 at the age of 56, was a near neighbour in South Devon, but he was also Richardson’s father’s close friend.</p> <p>“When I was a kid I did not believe Rik was real because he was just so funny, non-stop,” said up-and-coming standup comedian Richardson, talking about his personal and professional links with the late comic actor for the first time. “He was like Bad Santa, this older person who swore and who secretly gave us tenners to go off and get things. It was funny being with him when I was five – and it was just as funny when I was 20.” Mayall and Red’s father, the director and screenwriter Peter Richardson, had worked together on a long string of anarchic television films made under the banner <em>The Comic Strip Presents</em>, radically changing the tone of British television comedy in 1982 with their early parody <em>Five Go Mad in Dorset</em>, and with the influential cinema feature <em>The Supergrass</em>, in 1985. The films were co-scripted, and increasingly also directed by Peter Richardson, who starred on screen alongside a core acting team of Nigel Planer, Adrian Edmondson, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.</p> <p>Richardson Jr, 33, is in Edinburgh presenting his second full-length stand-up show, <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/red-richardson-shots-fired\" title=\"\">Shots Fired</a>, at the <a href=\"https://www.edfringe.com/\" title=\"\">fringe festival</a>, and he now has another strong connection to his father’s great friend: last year he married Mayall’s daughter, Rosie.</p> <p>“We had to cancel the wedding four times because of the pandemic. We booked a trip to Thailand and kept postponing,” said Richardson. “When we finally went, it rained for 20 days, but we had a good time.”</p> <p>The standup has avoided speaking about his family in case people assumed it led him into comedy: “I kept it secret and was desperate that no one found out. It took me a while to realise it would come out at some point, so you have to deal with it,” he said, adding that in his own mind he is a family maverick.</p> <p>“My father doesn’t know anyone in the standup world and has never performed in Edinburgh. He was often behind the camera anyway, so doesn’t get recognised much. When I was signed by an agent after the final of a stand-up competition, another act came up and said it had only happened because my dad was “Paul” Richardson. That sums it up really. People may still love <em>The Comic Strip</em>, but it was never a mainstream thing.”</p> <p>As a boy he was there when several of his father’s films were being made. He watched as a favourite scene from 1998’s <em>Four Men in a Car</em> was shot. “It is an amazing quick sequence in which Rik gets his arm crushed, Dad is sick and is then thrown in the boot and then Adrian gets headbutted by a lorry driver.”</p> <p>But for Red, the world of scripted comedy held no appeal. While he was driving for Mayall, he wrote to London’s Comedy Store club, won a try-out slot and fell in love with live gigs at the age of 25: “It was the best feeling ever. It’s the instant thing, the adrenaline. It’s a quite a fix.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37c40e4031052a50c4a57561fcd51d5584044d8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37c40e4031052a50c4a57561fcd51d5584044d8c/0_794_1829_1096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rik Mayall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rik Mayall was a leading member of The Comic Strip.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Lawn/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His father, now 70, enjoys the slower process of writing and directing, but Richardson sees standup as his destination, rather than a route to TV. “For a lot of acts it is a springboard to something else. I write for some TV panel shows and I do podcasts, but that is just to build my live audience,” he said.</p> <p>The new standup routine centres on a traumatic experience that made the news in November 2017. Along with many others, Richardson was caught up in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/24/oxford-circus-police-attend-tube-incident\" title=\"\">apparent terrorist attack</a> on Oxford Street. London was on full alert until it became clear it was a false alarm: “I was hiding inside Boots, then I ran up to the top of a building and hid under a desk. Ever since watching <em>Die Hard</em> I’d wondered how I would deal with a situation like that, and actually I just ran and screamed like everyone else. In a split second everything changed. Everyone went into survival mode. Sensory awareness was heightened, so every sound was clear. I saw mums pick up their kids and run like Olympic sprinters. I just made a fool of myself, and that is funny.”</p> <p>In comparison, the perils of live performance – the stage lighting and microphone both failed on the first night of his Edinburgh show two weeks ago – are insignificant: “It is a different show each time, but that night I felt like I was in an airport lounge and had just cornered a group of people to do a show for them. It is a tough career, with no security, no pension and lots of travel. But when it is good, it’s worth it.”</p> <p>Richardson’s wife, Rosie, 35, tells him she is also happy he has chosen to be an entertainer, like her father. “She absolutely hates performing though and works as a manager at a Soho restaurant. And I think we both know that Rik was a one-off. You can’t learn what he had. He was comedically gifted: a phenomenon.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-defied-those-who-would-silence-him-too-many-fear-causing-offence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Where Salman Rushdie defied those who would silence him, today too many fear causing offence | Kenan Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-defied-those-who-would-silence-him-too-many-fear-causing-offence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-defied-those-who-would-silence-him-too-many-fear-causing-offence","fields":{"headline":"Where Salman Rushdie defied those who would silence him, today too many fear causing offence","trailText":"The terrible injuries suffered by the great British writer will not extinguish his belief in the critical importance of saying the unsayable","byline":"Kenan Malik","body":"<p>‘A poet’s work,” one of the characters in Salman Rushdie’s <em>The Satanic Verses</em> observes, is “to name the unnamable, to point at frauds, to take sides, start arguments, shape the world and stop it from going to sleep.” “And if rivers of blood flow from the cuts his verses inflict,” the narrator adds, “then they will nourish him.”</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie\" title=\"\">Rushdie</a> lies, terribly injured, on a ventilator in a Pennsylvania hospital, there seems something appallingly prescient about the novel, the rage against which has spilled rivers of blood. Including, now, Rushdie’s own.</p> <p>What is particularly shocking about the attack is not just its savagery but also the fact that Rushdie had seemed to have triumphed over the malevolence of the fatwa. Imposed by Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini on Valentine’s Day 1989, the sentence of death forced Rushdie into hiding for almost a decade. It has never been rescinded, but the threat it posed appeared to have receded. For the past two decades, Rushdie has lived a relatively open life. And then came Friday’s attack.</p> <p>The reasons for the assault are not yet clear. It is difficult, though, not to see behind it the mordant shadow cast by Khomeini’s death warrant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Where Rushdie celebrated the unstitching of traditional boundaries, others yearned for new certainties </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Rushdie affair was a watershed in British political and cultural life, thrusting to the surface issues such as radical Islam, terrorism, the boundaries of free speech and the limits of tolerance. It was also a turning point in the way many thought about these issues. There developed in its wake both a greater hostility to Muslims and a stronger sense of the moral unacceptability of giving offence to other cultures or faiths in a plural society.</p> <p><em>The Satanic Verses</em>, Rushdie’s fourth novel, was as much an exploration of the migrant experience as it was about Islam, as savage in its indictment of racism as of religion. What mattered, though, was less what Rushdie wrote than what the novel came to symbolise. The 1980s was a decade that saw the beginnings of the breakdown of traditional political and moral boundaries, an unravelling with which we are still coming to terms.</p> <p>Rushdie was charting this new terrain, capturing the sense of displacement and dislocation, which he found exhilarating. <em>The Satanic Verses </em>was, he wrote while in hiding, “a love-song to our mongrel selves”, a work that “celebrates hybridity, impurity, intermingling, the transformation that comes of new and unexpected combinations of human beings, cultures, ideas, politics, movies, songs”. Many critics of <em>The Satanic Verses</em> believed “that intermingling with a different culture will inevitably weaken and ruin their own. I am of the opposite opinion.”</p> <p>Where Rushdie celebrated the unstitching of traditional boundaries, others yearned for new certainties. Fundamentalist Islam had previously had little presence within western Muslim communities. Now it gained a foothold, providing the certitude and purity that many began to crave.</p> <p>The anti-Rushdie campaign was perhaps the first great outpouring of rage at the tarnishing of symbols of identity at a time when such symbols were acquiring new significance. Britons of a Muslim background growing up in the 1970s and early 80s rarely viewed “Muslim” as their principal identity. The Rushdie affair gave notice of a shift in self-perception and of the beginnings of a distinctive Muslim identity.</p> <p>The battle over Rushdie’s novel had a profound impact on liberals, too, many of whom were equally disoriented by the unravelling of old certainties. Some saw in the Rushdie affair a “clash of civilisations” and themselves began reaching for the language of identity, questioning the very presence of Muslims as incompatible with the values of the west, a sentiment that has grown only stronger over the past three decades.</p> <p>For others, the Rushdie affair revealed the need for greater policing of speech. It’s worth recalling how extraordinary, in contemporary terms, was the response to the fatwa. Not only was Rushdie forced into hiding but bookshops were firebombed, translators and publishers murdered.</p> <p>Yet Penguin, the publisher, never wavered in its commitment to <em>The Satanic Verses</em>. It recognised, Penguin CEO Peter Mayer later recalled, that what was at stake was “much more than simply the fate of this one book”. How Penguin responded “would affect the future of free inquiry, without which there would be no publishing as we knew it”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>What is deemed ‘offence to a community’ is more often a debate within communities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s an attitude that seems to belong to a different age. Today, many believe that plural societies can only function properly if people self-censor by limiting, in the words of the sociologist Tariq Modood, “the extent to which they subject each other’s fundamental beliefs to criticism”.</p> <p>I take the opposite view. It is in a plural society that free speech becomes particularly important. In such societies, it is both inevitable and, at times, important that people offend the sensibilities of others. Inevitable, because where different beliefs are deeply held, clashes are unavoidable. They are better openly resolved than suppressed in the name of “respect”.</p> <p>And important, because any kind of social progress means offending some deeply held sensibilities. “You can’t say that!” is all too often the response of those in power to having their power challenged. To accept that certain things cannot be said is to accept that certain forms of power cannot be challenged.</p> <p>What is deemed “offence to a community” is more often a debate within communities. That’s why so many flashpoints over offensiveness involve minority artists – not just Rushdie but Hanif Kureishi, Monica Ali, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/24/10-years-behzti-gurpreet-bhatti-birmingham-sikh-protest\" title=\"\">Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooreh_Hera\" title=\"\">Sooreh Hera</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/15/mf-husain-obituary\" title=\"\">MF Husain</a> and many others.</p> <p>Rushdie’s critics no more spoke for the Muslim community than Rushdie did. Both represented different strands of opinion within Muslim communities. Rushdie gave voice to a radical, secular sentiment that in the 1980s was highly visible. Rushdie’s critics spoke for some of the most conservative strands. It is the progressive voices that such conservatives seek to silence that are most betrayed by constraints on the giving of offence. It is their challenge to traditional norms that are often deemed “offensive”.</p> <p>Human beings, Rushdie observed in his 1990 essay In Good Faith, “shape their futures by arguing and challenging and questioning and saying the unsayable; not by bowing the knee whether to gods or to men”.</p> <p>We can only hope for Salman Rushdie’s recovery from his terrible attack. What we can insist on, however, is continuing to “say the unsayable”, to question the boundaries imposed by both racists and religious bigots. Anything less would be a betrayal.</p> <p><em>• </em>Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist and author of From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Aftermath</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But then mysterious signs in the sky offer either an unexpected opportunity, or a “bad miracle” …</p> <p>Despite there being extensive spoilers everywhere about what OJ is up against, it’s best to see <em>Nope</em> unprepared and spend a healthy amount of time wondering “WTF is going on?!” Suffice to say that Peele draws on a wide range of influences, from the awestruck human befuddlement of <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> to the eerie, angelic forms of the Japanese TV series <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13nSISwxrY4\">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, and (accidentally?) the far-too-pleased-with-itself silliness of M Night Shyamalan’s <em>The Happening</em><em>. </em>He also picks up cine-literate threads from Antonioni’s swinging 60s parable <em>Blow-Up</em><em>, </em>Sidney Poitier’s 70s western <em>Buck and the Preacher</em><em> </em>(a poster for which hangs on the ranch wall), Katsuhiro Otomo’s 80s manga <em>Akira</em> (which Peele was once tapped to remake) and even Ron Underwood’s cult desert-bound 90s monster movie <em>Tremors</em><em>. </em>More importantly, he rips off (or “pays homage to”) the iconic chase sequences from <em>Jaws</em>, with inflatable air dancers standing in for those floating yellow barrels that made Spielberg’s shark all the more terrifying when unseen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1eae7595406fafb2bc4f02a56335fc64da8ad925\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eae7595406fafb2bc4f02a56335fc64da8ad925/503_0_2977_1788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Kaluuya, Brandon Perea and Keke Palmer in Nope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Scene-stealing’ Brandon Perea, centre, with Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer in Nope. Universal Pictures</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From this rich stew, Peele cooks up an elliptical (and sometimes frustratingly paced) yarn about our habit of staring in stupefaction at danger, disaster and trauma. This is hardly news to cinemagoers who have spent a century happily gawping at the fiery wrath of early biblical epics (<em>Nope</em> opens with an Old Testament threat to “make you a spectacle”) and the modern chaos of disaster hits such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/17/news1\">The Poseidon Adventure</a></em><em> </em>and <em>The Towering Inferno</em>. More recently we had the end-of-the-world loops of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/09/interstellar-review-sci-fi-spectacle-delivers\">Interstellar</a></em>, with which this film shares ace director of photography Hoyte van Hoytema, a man who knows about capturing the cataclysmic on screen. Sure enough, the character who most verges on caricature<em> </em>is an eccentric Ahab/Quint-like cinematographer (Michael Wincott) who uses not a harpoon but a hand-cranked camera to “capture” this prize beast after surveillance-cam techie Angel (scene-stealing rising star Brandon Perea) discovers that his quarry eats electricity for breakfast.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In8fuzj3gck\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/In8fuzj3gck?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In8fuzj3gck\">Watch a trailer for Nope.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There’s a neat irony in conjuring an Imax-friendly essay on the perils of gazing. And beyond the surreal sci-fi spectacles and gorgeously rendered night-time vistas, <em>Nope</em>’s warnings about enraging an opponent – whether it’s a startled chimp or an amorphous sky blob – by looking it in the eye strike a down-to-earth chord in a racially divided world (perhaps OJ’s adversary is a metaphor for white supremacy?). Yet Peele’s ability to balance these intriguing ideas with the brutally kinetic demands of blockbuster cinema is more uncertain, making this a better movie to argue about than to watch. Remember – <em>Jaws</em> may not have been “about” a shark, but it still moved like one. As with the brilliantly horrifying sitcom bloodbath that serves as <em>Nope</em>’s attention-grabbing curtain-raiser, the film too often seems to be heading somewhere extraordinary, only to disappear into an ambitious conceptual hole that, while occasionally startling, is ultimately less than the sum of its parts.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2022/aug/14/life-for-afghan-women-one-year-after-the-taliban-took-power","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘I was a policewoman.

They shouted I was a prostitute because I was unveiled, and demanded to know why I wasn’t wearing the hijab. They pointed their guns in my face, and one of them had his finger on the trigger. I lowered my head and said: “It won’t happen again.” When I got home, I sat and cried for an hour. I said to myself: this is a warning for what is coming next. Since then, I have fallen into a deep depression. I can’t bear to look at all my colourful clothes in my closet as they remind me of everything I have lost.</p> <p><em>Zahra, west Kabul<br></em>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/taliban-order-all-afghan-women-to-wear-burqa\">hijab order was announced</a>, I was caught by Taliban fighters. They asked why I was not wearing the hijab, and although I have no intention of following their orders, I apologised and thought they would let me go. But they visited my home and told my family the next time I was caught in public uncovered I would be arrested. Since then, my father has rarely allowed me or my sisters to leave the house, and says we can’t go to university. Even my brothers now know what I wear and where I go at all times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ec9fdccf16eea9df604fc3ab21b6169d64466e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ec9fdccf16eea9df604fc3ab21b6169d64466e7/0_0_5500_3667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Afghan woman walks through the old market as a Taliban fighter stands guard, in downtown Kabul 3 May 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Afghan woman walks through the old market as a Taliban fighter stands guard, in downtown Kabul 3 May 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ebrahim Noroozi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Travel restrictions</strong></h2> <p><em>Zarlasht, Kabul<br></em>In June, I was travelling with my brother and we were stopped at a checkpoint by Taliban fighters. Firstly, they questioned us separately to understand if we were related to each other, then they asked for our national ID cards. When my brother said we didn’t carry our ID cards with us, they got angry and one of them hit him with a rifle and was about to fire. We were made to sit there for two hours, and then we had to call our families to bring ID cards so we could return home. Since then, I do not dare to leave the house.</p> <h2><strong>University students</strong></h2> <p><em>Sabira, </em><em>Bamyan province</em><em><br></em>Even though it is not mandatory we are being forced to wear the black hijab to be allowed to enter university. Once we’re inside, women are under constant surveillance. There are hijab notices on the doors and walls. I never imagined that one day, in Bamyan, all female students would be forced to live like this. I can’t believe what life is turning into here.</p> <h2><strong>Islamic State attacks</strong></h2> <p><em>Abassi, west Kabul<br></em>My friend and I were chatting on the bus on the way to work in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/29/hazara-shias-flee-afghanistan-fearing-taliban-persecution\">Hazara Shia</a> neighbourhood of west Kabul when suddenly the world around us exploded. We found ourselves in the middle of carnage. Since the Taliban took control, security has deteriorated and our bus had been bombed by IS militants. We later found out that many people were killed. I was wounded in my leg and chest, and my friend in her right leg. When the bomb went off, everything changed for me. After the Taliban took over, things were hard but I continued my work and was determined to live bravely. Now, after the attack, I live in constant fear. The pain of my injuries has been excruciating. I’ve gone through five surgeries and can’t go to the bathroom or dress myself without help. But the psychological wounds are also deep. I have to pass the place where the bomb exploded to get to my doctor appointments, and every time I feel the vehicle shaking, the heat of the explosion and the sound of people screaming. It keeps repeating and repeating in front of my eyes when I try to sleep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64d06394496dbdfd81a56b396ee8dffeb748b6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64d06394496dbdfd81a56b396ee8dffeb748b6f/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I do not dare to leave the house.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I do not dare to leave the house.’<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Widows</strong></h2> <p><em>Sakina, Kandahar<br></em>Life has not been easy for a long time. I lost my husband in an airstrike five years ago, and before the Taliban took power I worked and sold street food to support my children. Now I am not allowed to work. The Taliban has given me and other widows a card to claim a sack of wheat, three litres of cooking oil and 1,000 Afghani [£9] every three months, but this is not enough to keep our family going. I live with three other widowed women and their children, but our rent is 40,000 Afghani a month and we can’t pay it. If we can’t work, I’m worried we will starve.</p> <p><em>Maryam, former policewoman, location protected<br></em>Until the Taliban took power, I worked as a police officer. My husband had died but I could support my two daughters on my police salary, I could give them everything they needed. Now I have lost my job, and the Taliban have been hunting down women who worked in the security services. I am still terrified they will find me. For the past seven months, I have been reduced to begging on the streets to feed my girls. I sit all day on the street under a burqa so that nobody recognises me and informs on me. I don’t recognise who I have become. One day, two boys threw some coins at me, and one said I was a prostitute. I went home with only enough to buy two loaves of bread for my children, and cried all night. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99a5b8893ccb2d4d35cfeee7de0a3769be721cf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a5b8893ccb2d4d35cfeee7de0a3769be721cf9/0_0_6529_4352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Girls studying in a secret school at an undisclosed location in Afghanistan, 24 July 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Girls studying in a secret school at an undisclosed location in Afghanistan, 24 July 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Education</strong></h2> <p><em>Mah Liqa, 14, location protected<br></em>When I was told I wasn’t allowed to go to school, I was depressed and had no motivation to work and study at home. But I kept telling myself I had to keep going for a better future and for my dreams. I need to find ways to keep learning despite the ban on girls going to school. So now every day I study English at home so I can apply for a scholarship, and maybe some day study computer science abroad. I am still trying to achieve something for myself.</p> <p><em>Samira, 18, location protected<br></em>I should be in grade 12 but I’m not allowed to go to school. After the Taliban took power, I decided to turn challenge into opportunity, so now I buy raw materials like beads and fabric from the market and sell them on to women who make traditional clothing in their homes. I’ve made some money, and now I want to use this to start a factory of my own if the situation improves.

The Taliban said I can continue with my engravings, but I know it is impossible. I am self-censoring because I don’t feel safe. I used to engrave faces and figures but now I mainly print verses of the holy Qur’an on wood. I have to find another way to survive and to forget art. I used to spend every day in my studio but now I just go back every one or two months to dust off my engravings and tools. I’ve auctioned off most of my equipment, and my friends are advising me to leave Afghanistan. My Iranian customers tell me to move to Iran, where my work will be valued.

I come from a family of poets and writers, and I have a master’s degree. Two months into the Taliban rule in Herat, myself and four friends decided to form a book club. The first book we chose was a Persian translation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/aug/26/internationalwriting1\">The Clown</a><em>, </em>a 1963 novel by the German writer Heinrich Böll. We hold our meetings in secret, but soon others heard about what we were doing. Now we have over 40 members from all walks of life, and hold discussions on Telegram. Some of us try to meet every two weeks to discuss and critique world literature. We choose books that are available to us in Afghanistan but also say something wider about the world, many about the hardships women have had to ensure through history – what they did to make those days bearable. We also read books written by people who lived through the second world war, as we can all identify with those survivors. It is a struggle to keep the spirit of the women of Herat alive.

An uncomfortable, even distressing question now arises: should Ukrainians prepare for a stab in the back this winter?</p> <p>Nearly six months into the war, the widening gap between rhetoric and reality grows potentially fatal.

On Tuesday, voters will rank their preferred candidates to fill the congressional seat through the end of the year. They’ll also vote in “pick one” primaries for the House term that begins in January, the Senate race, the governor’s and lieutenant governor’s races, and 59 state legislative races. </p> <p>“This is a big election for us,” said Jenny-Marie Stryker, political director of The Alaska Center, a progressive group. The special election will fill a seat held by the late Don Young, a Republican who was first elected to Congress 1973 and was the longest-serving member of the House. “It’s a rare opportunity for change. It’s really exciting – and uncertain.” Across political divides and 665,000 sq miles of mountains, glaciers and tundra, the largest US state is navigating an election unlike any before.</p> <p>In Palin’s hometown of Wasilla, a city of about 10,000 in the valley of the misty, snow-laced Chugach and Talkeetna Mountains, many voters are unsure of what to make of the world’s renewed interest in their community as their hometown hero launches her political comeback bid.</p> <p>“Ever since she was picked as a vice-presidential candidate, I’ve gotten jokes from family out of state about whether we ride moose to school,” said Heather Kruse, 31, who works at the local medical supply store. “It’s pretty cool to be recognized, I guess,” said Krause, who remembers Palin as warm and engaged when she met her in 2006. “And we can take a joke over here.”</p> <p>Still, Palin’s star has faded a bit over the past decade.</p> <p>At Chimo guns, the local gun and outdoor supply store where Palin and her family used to shop, the proprietor isn’t sure what happened to the photo of Palin that used to hang behind the counter. He does know that when Palin, now 58, went from mayor of Wasilla to governor and then vice-presidential candidate and TV celebrity, Wasilla changed. “This used to be a quiet little community,” said Craig, the shop’s towering owner who said did not want his last name printed in the news. In 2008, the media descended on the town, he said. “And we just kind of lost our innocence. It’s never been the same since.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75038748c0cf1818d6b909b71bf5c2b7dbf7b381\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75038748c0cf1818d6b909b71bf5c2b7dbf7b381/0_1_3496_2096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John McCain and Palin at a campaign rally for McCain in Tucson, Arizona, in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McCain and Palin at a campaign rally for McCain in Tucson, Arizona, in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearly a decade and a half ago, when Palin first thundered into the governor’s seat – a fiery young newcomer, unseating a powerful political incumbent – her approval rating topped off at just over 90% according to Ivan Moore – an Anchorage-based pollster. She was the fresh new face of Alaskan politics, a staunch conservative who was nonetheless willing to take on corruption within her own party, a pragmatist who was open to working with Democrats.</p> <p>Before she denied the climate crisis and declared “global warming my gluteus maximus” in a 2013 Facebook post, she created the Alaska Climate Change Sub-Cabinet. Before she turned “drill, baby, drill’ into a national slogan, she sought to raise taxes on the oil and gas industry.</p> <p>“For a short period of time, she was a tremendously open, fair and progressive leader in Alaska,” Moore said. “And then of course, it all went horribly wrong.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her ideological flips were pretty stunning</p> <footer> <cite>Diane Hirshberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Sarah Palin who rose to national prominence as John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 elections, the “mama grizzly” who spouted rabid run-on rambles, was initially unrecognisable to many Alaskans. “Her ideological flips were pretty stunning,” said Diane Hirshberg, director of the University of Alaska Institute of Social and Economic Research.</p> <p>On the national scene, Palin was a loose-lipped loose cannon – one who lobbed base, racist attacks against Barack Obama, embraced radical rightwing ideologies and denigrated the “lying” news media rather than answer basic policy questions. In many ways, she blazed a trail for Donald Trump – captivating the country as a renegade far-right celebrity.</p> <p>It follows, then, Palin’s biggest appearance so far was in July, alongside Trump and far-right senate candidate Kelly Tshibaka at an Anchorage rally. While her challengers addressed voters at a candidate forum in Kenai this month, Palin was fundraising in Minneapolis, alongside fervent Trump ally and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell.</p> <p>“Sarah didn’t even show up to the July 4 parade in Wasilla,” said Lisa Stewart, 62 – who attended a local meet-and-greet session with Begich ahead of election day. “That blew my mind, that she couldn’t make time for her home town.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"478a2186f51218b683f0c2015dfc6210a4075d47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/478a2186f51218b683f0c2015dfc6210a4075d47/0_6_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kelly Tshibaka, center, and her husband, Niki Tshibaka, left, clap for Palin, right, after she joined the stage with Donald Trump during a rally in Anchorage, Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelly Tshibaka, center, and her husband, Niki Tshibaka, left, clap for Palin, right, after she joined the stage with Donald Trump during a rally in Anchorage, Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Roth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stewart, a retired teacher, said she had taught a couple of Palin’s children, and she’s been a longtime friend of Palin’s parents. “I think she’s a different person now than the Sarah I knew.”</p> <p>A big point of contention for many supporters was that she quit the governorship in 2009, amid ethics scandals, not long after losing her vice-presidential bid. And until recently, many former supporters said she’s been absent.</p> <p>Even Trump’s support doesn’t hold much sway here. Stewart, like many Begich supporters, voted for Trump, and are backing his candidate Tshibaka for Senate over incumbent Lisa Murkowski. “But even Trump picks some duds,” laughed Mike Coons, 69. “And anyway, where is Sarah? I don’t see her around here.”</p> <p>Indeed, Palin has always branded herself as a maverick, political outsider – but this time around she has rarely campaigned inside Alaska. She has avoided media interviews, and her campaign did not respond to multiple queries from the Guardian, including requests to share her campaign schedule.</p> <p>In Wasilla and the broader Matanuska-Susitna valley that encompasses the city, a deeply conservative stronghold that any republican candidate needs to win a statewide race, Begich has seized upon her absence. The day before the election, he’s holding an event at Palin’s former in-laws house in Wasilla.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b1d5d0fe3660aa523cd57b9660963ccf65b81aa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1d5d0fe3660aa523cd57b9660963ccf65b81aa5/0_407_6016_3609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Begich meets with supporters in Sarah Palin’s hometown of Wasilla.

At a meet-and-greet event in Wasilla, held at another local couple’s stately home overlooking the sprawling Chugach mountain range, Begich chats with supporters who know Palin personally, her neighbors and family friends.</p> <p>“You know, Palin doesn’t have a sole claim to Wasilla,” he said. “These are my people too.”</p> <p>Begich 44, has a famous name as well. He’s grandson to Nick Begich Sr, who represented Alaska in the House, and the nephew of Mark Begich, a former mayor of Anchorage and US senator representing the state. Begich’s other uncle, Tom Begich, is a state senator. The catch? All of the other politicians in the candidate’s family are Democrats.</p> <p>“I think that’s going to be a big struggle for him,” said Ron Johnson, a representative of the Alaska Republican party, which has endorsed Begich. “I know him to be a true conservative. He’s just really got to keep getting that message out there.”</p> <p>Palin does still retain a good amount of support. She finished the state’s special primary election ahead of a pack of 48 candidates. “I think she’s amazing,” said Kari James, 47, a landscaper who was pleasantly surprised to learn that she’d be tending to the garden boxes outside of Palin’s Anchorage headquarters last week. She‘s the sort of person who could blaze into Washington “and put all those progressives in their place”, she said.</p> <p>The blue-shingled building was quiet, and the parking lot mostly empty – with a sole campaign worker inside to greet anyone who wandered in looking for a lawn sign. “It’s true she’s not as accessible,” James said. “But she is just more famous than the others.”</p> <p>For better or worse, several voters across Anchorage and Wasilla told the Guardian that Palin was still the candidate they knew best. “I just don’t know anything about Begich or Peltola,” said Nate Kile, 46 – who knew for sure he didn’t want to vote for Palin, but said that campaign outreach from her opponents had rarely filtered through to him. “I’m just totally lost,” said Heather Hile, 43 – who was on a date with Kile at a colorful used bookstore and café in Anchorage’s Spenard neighbourhood – an especially progressive enclave within blue-leaning Anchorage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0144fcf4f2f3c20188c1b241fa066b67bc5216cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0144fcf4f2f3c20188c1b241fa066b67bc5216cc/0_342_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Peltola is shown leaving a voting booth during early voting in Anchorage, Alaska.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Peltola is shown leaving a voting booth during early voting in Anchorage, Alaska.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thiessen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peltola, 48, a former state legislator who is running a grassroots campaign focused on infrastructure, environmental conservation and economic issues, has a natural base in many parts of the city – but also comes to the race with less funding and resources than her millionaire opponents. In an interview with the Guardian at the Writer’s Block café and bookstore in Anchorage, she says she’s aiming to fit in as many one-on-one meetings with voters across the vast state as she can ahead of the election. Her message is that she’s willing to work with both conservatives and progressives to advance Alaskan interests in congress. If she wins, Peltola, who is Yup’ik, would be the first Native Alaskan to represent the state in the House.</p> <p>“If we’re really going to start solving our problems and getting to solutions, we have to show up not angry and not bitter, and not blaming other people,” Peltola said. “We have to show up open-minded.” Though she differentiates herself from Palin and Begich on policies, she won’t respond to Palin’s fervency with any negativity. “She and I overlapped in the state capitol, and we were both pregnant at the same time,” she said. “I respect her and her supporters.” And if they’re ranking her first, Peltola would kindly ask that they consider listing her as a second choice.</p> <p>For Shirley Mae Springer Staten, 76, who was listening to the live music being performed at Anchorage’s Wild Salmon Festival, Peltola’s openness evoked the sort of politics that the late congressman Don Young practised. Young was far more prickly, and Jackson didn’t necessarily agree with all his policies. “But at the end of the day, he was working for Alaska,” she said. “We need someone in Congress who’s just focused on doing the work. Not stirring up this toxic anger.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/14/the-last-colony-by-philippe-sands-review-britains-chagos-islands-shame","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"The Last Colony by Philippe Sands review – Britain’s Chagos Islands shame","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/the-last-colony-by-philippe-sands-review-britains-chagos-islands-shame","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/14/the-last-colony-by-philippe-sands-review-britains-chagos-islands-shame","fields":{"headline":"The Last Colony by Philippe Sands review – Britain’s Chagos Islands shame","trailText":"The Chagossians were forced from their archipelago in the 1970s.

Elysé, a diminutive figure, dressed in mourning black, clutching her handbag, was then 65 and the story of her life is also the story of this book. Elysé had been called to the court by Sands to represent the people of the Chagos Islands, the Indian Ocean archipelago from which, in 1973, the entire population was forcibly removed by the British colonial administration in order that a US military base could be established on one of the islands, Diego Garcia. Elysé spoke to the 14 international judges of the court about that history for just under four minutes. No one present would forget her statement.</p> <p>First, she recalled, the British shut down the islands’ plantations and cut off food supplies to the remembered paradise of her childhood. The hundreds of Chagossian families were told that they had no option but to leave by ship by 27 April 1973 or slowly starve. “We were like animals in that slave ship,” she remembered of her 20-year-old self. “People were dying of sadness.” Elysé was four months pregnant. Her child was subsequently stillborn.</p> <p>From that day onwards, Elysé and all the people on the ship had been unable to return to the place where their families had lived for generations. Many of those families were watching a live stream of her testimony in a community centre in Mauritius, where most had settled. Those with the longest memories were in tears when their representative told the court: “My heart is suffering and my heart still belongs to the island where I was born.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436c5c12d1a3924256ef530f924f89b850a949ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436c5c12d1a3924256ef530f924f89b850a949ea/0_0_5785_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philippe Sands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philippe Sands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sands, who was leading the Chagossians’ repatriation case against the British government – and the ongoing claims of Mauritius that the islands are part of their nation – uses Elysé’s personal history to explore the wider tragedy and scandal of the place now officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). His case highlights the post-colonial hypocrisy that continues to use UN human rights conventions as a basis for sovereign self-determination of the people of the Falkland Islands, or Gibraltar, but which for decades has wholly disregarded the application of those conventions in the case of the Chagossians.</p> <p>Sands’s book began as a series of lectures delivered to The Hague Academy of International Law, and as a narrative it betrays those discursive origins. While examining the displacement of the island people, many of whom have died in exile, Sands also sketches out the history of the international court of justice in The Hague, and its incremental role in dismantling colonial structures around the world, the inching forward of freedoms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sands makes a steely and forensic case, laced with human empathy, against successive British foreign ministers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He does this in the context of his own journey of discovery about postwar human rights that led him, for example, to be a critical voice in the investigations of the unsafe legal basis for the invasion of Iraq. The origin of those convictions, as he sets them out, lay in the brutal knowledge that two of his great-grandmothers, both widows, had been deported from Vienna to die in Theresienstadt and Treblinka during the Holocaust.</p> <p>His history of British exceptionalism in these matters goes back to the 1945 Yalta conference, in which the new world order – and the parameters of the cold war – were established. Churchill’s words to Roosevelt and Stalin ring down the decades to our present moment: “I will have no suggestion that the British empire is to be put in the dock and examined by everybody to see if it is up to their standard,” the prime minister said. “Never. Never. Never… Every scrap of territory over which the British flag flies is immune.”</p> <p>If the history of British foreign affairs in the subsequent 75 years could be written as the reluctant erosion of that infamous delusion, then the case of the Chagos Islanders is one of its last chapters. Sands makes a steely and forensic case, laced with human empathy, against successive British foreign ministers, including Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt and Liz Truss, who have done everything in their power to try to make the Chagossians’ case go away, to refuse to accept that the last knockings of empire be subject to international justice.</p> <p>In 2019, as a result of the hearings involving Elysé’s testimony, the <a href=\"https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/169\">judges at The Hague stated </a>that the UK is under “…an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible, and that all member states must cooperate with the United Nations to complete the decolonisation of Mauritius”. At the same time that Brexiter government ministers were standing up in parliament to suggest that international law could be broken in certain circumstances and Tories boasted about plans to tear up human rights, the UN general assembly voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of setting a six-month deadline for the UK to withdraw from the Chagos Archipelago. The ruling hardly made the news.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84ec8d29db853f7ead48bd50e22edca13bdfe0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ec8d29db853f7ead48bd50e22edca13bdfe0cd/0_0_721_1009/715.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration by Martin Rowson from The Last Colony.\" width=\"715\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration by Martin Rowson from The Last Colony. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Illustration From Philippe Sands' The Last Colony. Needs more info</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sands’s book, which comes with typically pointed and scabrous illustration by the <em>Guardian</em>’s Martin Rowson, is an important and welcome corrective to that indifference. On Valentine’s Day this year, a delegation including the Mauritian ambassador to the UN <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/mauritius-formally-challenges-britains-ownership-of-chagos-islands\">raised the Mauritian flag</a> on the Chagossian atoll of Peros Banhos in a move regarded as a formal challenge to British sovereignty.</p> <p>Sands was in the group that landed on Peros Banhos; so was Liseby Elysé, along with five other islanders, the first exiles to set foot on the beaches of their homeland for half a century. On the island they came across a tarnished metal plaque signed by the “BIOT commissioner’s representative” engraved with the age-old landowner’s and colonialist’s mantra, that “trespassers will be prosecuted”. As Sands’s book makes clear, and despite Britain’s shameful intractability, there is now not a judge in all the world to uphold that threat.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Last Colony</em> by Philippe Sands is published by Weidenfeld (£16.99).

They wore plain clothes and were given access by the Secret Service without drama.</p> <p>The agents reportedly seized <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/13/nuclear-or-not-classified-or-not-mar-a-lago-files-spell-out-jeopardy-for-trump\">11 sets of classified information</a>, some of which was marked “top secret”, along with binders, handwritten notes and information about the “President of France”. Trump denied a Washington Post article that said the search was for possible classified materials related to nuclear weapons.</p> <p>It ended at about 6.30pm on Monday and word broke on social media a few minutes later, quickly followed by confirmation from Trump himself. In a characteristically hyperbolic statement, he fumed that Mar-a-Lago was “currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents. Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before… They even broke into my safe!”</p> <p>Trump claimed the search was politically motivated and attempted to draw a contrast with his old foe Hillary Clinton, but perhaps the most important sentence asserted: “It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024.”</p> <p>Like a herd of wildebeest, Republicans stampeded thunderously as one. “Weaponization”, “banana republic” and “dictatorship” were the go-to words of the week along with a blitz of fundraising emails. Some in the party of law and order, which had castigated Democrats over the “defund the police” slogan, were now calling for the FBI to be defunded.</p> <p>Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, claimed that the government has gone the way of “the Gestapo”, the secret police in Nazi Germany. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepGosar/status/1556821907726630915?s=20&amp;t=uEyVgD14EUyaWpPqbtRoPA\">tweeted</a>: “We must destroy the FBI. We must save America.

Perhaps more tellingly, even Republicans who had previously distanced themselves from Trump felt compelled to toe the line. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell demanded a “thorough and immediate explanation” of what led to the search.</p> <p>The former vice-president Mike Pence, who fell out with the former president over January 6, said “the appearance of continued partisanship by the justice department must be addressed”. Other potential contenders for the Republican nomination in 2024, including Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/08/09/trump-fbi-raid-2024-republican-president\">joined the chorus</a>.</p> <p>Opinion polls confirmed that the FBI search had given Trump at least a modest boost among Republicans. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2022/08/11/exclusive-new-poll-on-the-fbi-mar-a-lago-search-00051121\">A survey by Morning Consult</a> found that 57% of<strong> </strong>Republican voters and Republican-leaning independents would vote for Trump if the 2024 primary were being held today, up from 53% in mid-July. DeSantis fell from 23% to 17% over the same period.</p> <p>This followed a run of victories for Trump-backed candidates in congressional primary elections. In the spring and early summer, his record had been uneven with notable setbacks in states such as Georgia. But this month, his slate of election-deniers beat establishment-backed candidates in Arizona.</p> <p>The businessman Tim Michels won the Republican primary for governor of Wisconsin with Trump’s backing. Most of the 10 Republican members of Congress who voted to impeach Trump have either retired or lost. Liz Cheney, the vice-chair of the January 6 committee, will be on the Wyoming ballot on Tuesday and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/13/liz-cheney-primary-election-wyoming-january-6\">widely expected to lose her seat</a>.</p> <p>A the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Dallas, Texas, 69% of attendees said they wanted Trump as the Republican nominee in 2024, well ahead of DeSantis on 24%. Jim McLaughlin, who conducted <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/trump-wins-cpac-straw-poll-dallas-texas/index.html\">the straw poll, said</a>: “He’s more popular than ever.”</p> <p>Yet even as Trump tightens his grip on the Republican base, his new status as the first former US president to suffer the indignity of having his home searched by the FBI offers another reason why moderate and independent voters could slip through his fingers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Larry Sabato,</a> director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: “There are two contrary effects. With Republicans, or at least the Republican base, this has caused them to rally around not the flag but Donald Trump. It has strengthened him within the party and discouraged people like DeSantis, whether he admits it or not, and the others aren’t even on the radar screen at this point.</p> <p>“But the contrary effect for not just Democrats but also independents is it makes Trump less electable in 2024. People look at him and even if they like him they say his time has passed and he’s too controversial, I’ve heard this a million times and I don’t think it’s exceptional.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, agrees that Republicans’ fast and furious defense of Trump should not necessarily be taken at face value as the midterms approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/11/us-west-disaster-hit-climate-bill\">An anxious American west sizes up historic climate bill: ‘We need every tool’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said: “They’re squeezing all of this enthusiasm out of his base, promising them all sorts of things, just to make sure that they get out and vote on 8 November.”</p> <p>Schiller added: “They’re using Donald Trump to get to the promised land in November but, as soon as they get there, it’s not clear to me that they stay loyal to him particularly. They don’t have to. Once they get the Congress, particularly if they get the Senate, and if Ron DeSantis wins big in Florida for re-election, he doesn’t need Donald Trump to get the nomination or the presidency.”</p> <p>Whatever their motivations, Republicans’ rush of incendiary and reckless rhetoric also came with a dark and dangerous side. Pro-Trump online chatrooms filled with calls for violence and phrases such as “lock and load” while “civil war” trended on Twitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6146f8879c59540b2e61e5970931711eecbee428\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6146f8879c59540b2e61e5970931711eecbee428/0_133_7548_4529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democrats applaud after Nancy Pelosi signs the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate protections, among other measures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democrats applaud after Nancy Pelosi signs the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate protections, among other measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Thursday an armed man wearing body armor tried to breach a security screening area at an FBI field office in Ohio, then fled and was later killed after a standoff with law enforcement.

In a separate case, he sat for a deposition on Wednesday as the New York attorney general, Letitia James, wraps up a civil investigation into allegations that his company misled lenders and tax authorities about asset values.</p> <p>Even as Trump invoked his fifth-amendment protection against self-incrimination more than 400 times, Biden was at the White House celebrating another victory. He signed bipartisan legislation to pour billions of dollars into care for military <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-entertainment-jon-stewart-health-care-reform-congress-a015fc694b7faa3227446bc9cf822441\">veterans exposed to toxic burn pits</a>.</p> <p>It was one of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f670481-f8ee-4f2a-83d2-856453d03a87\">several victories for a president</a> who just last month was being written off as a likely one-term president with an approval rating below 40% – worse even than Trump’s – because of inflation, a stalled agenda and a desire for generational change. The <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/08/05/democrats-unwilling-to-back-biden\">Axios website started a list </a>of Democratic officials’ positions on whether they want Biden to run again in 2024, noting that two gave firm “no”s and 19 dodged the question.</p> <p>But the narrative has shifted quickly in just a few weeks even as Biden battled a coronavirus infection and lingering cough. Congress, where Democrats have wafer-thin majorities, sent bipartisan bills addressing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-signs-gun-violence-bill-c21249287f976c2c164d8753205c2e6d\">gun violence</a> and boosting the nation’s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-covid-science-technology-health-fdcb2db42f91dcdbdd844d6dd463f95a\">high-tech manufacturing sector</a> to his desk.</p> <p>On Friday, the president secured what he called the “final piece” of his economic agenda with passage of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/us-house-passes-climate-bill-inflation-reduction-act\">$740bn climate and prescription drug deal</a> once thought dead. In addition, petrol prices dipped below $4 a gallon for the first time since March, inflation appears to be stabilising and the economy added 528,000 jobs in July, bringing the unemployment rate to 3.5%, the lowest in half a century.</p> <p>And Biden successfully ordered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/us-strike-afghanistan-kills-al-qaida-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri\">the killing of al-Qaida leader</a> Ayman al-Zawahri in a US drone strike in Afghanistan, the most significant blow to the terrorist network since the death of Osama Bin Laden. Democrats and the White House hope the run of victories will revive their their political fortunes in time for the midterms.</p> <p><a href=\"https://dornsife-center-for-political-future.usc.edu/staff/robert-m-shrum/\">Bob Shrum</a>, a veteran Democratic strategist, said: “When you combine what’s happened in the last month legislatively with the supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade [the constitutional right to abortion], you may have a very different situation for Democrats going into the midterms and for Biden in the second half of his term and a possible re-election.”</p> <p>Shrum, director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California Dornsife, does not buy the notion that Trump has been strengthened by his latest crisis. “He’s still the dominant force in the Republican party but he’s not as dominant as he was a year ago. He might be able to win a plurality nomination, but I actually think he’d be a very weak Republican nominee. He literally could get into a position where running would be a part time occupation and defending himself in court would be the full time occupation.”</p> <p>The 2024 election is an age away. Most commentators agree that, despite all the unknowables facing both men, including those related to being older than any other American presidents in history, a Biden v Trump rematch remains the most likely scenario.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/michael-steele-donald-trump-republican-party-interview\">Michael Steele</a>, a Trump critic and former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “Let’s settle this once and for all. Let’s stomp Trump’s ass into the ground one more time. He lost by 8m votes last time; he’ll lose by 16m next time. You want to play? Let’s play. Democrats, with all their navel gazing, whining and bellyaching about Joe Biden’s age and this and that, shut the hell up!”</p> <p>Steele added: “The most likely outcome going into 2024 is that it will be a repeat of the 2020 election. All stakes remain the same, if not higher, and the American people are going to have to decide once and for all: are we down with autocracy or are we up with democracy?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/14/the-big-picture-sabine-weiss-paris-photography-poetry-instant","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"The big picture: Sabine Weiss’s surreal vision of Paris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/14/the-big-picture-sabine-weiss-paris-photography-poetry-instant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/14/the-big-picture-sabine-weiss-paris-photography-poetry-instant","fields":{"headline":"The big picture: Sabine Weiss’s surreal vision of Paris","trailText":"Sent to capture a shop display, the famed photographer focused instead on a man sleeping on the pavement","byline":"Tim Adams","body":"<p>This picture dramatises the two distinct sides of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/31/sabine-weiss-obituary\">Sabine Weiss</a>’s art. Weiss, born in Switzerland in 1923, had made her name as a photographer taking pictures of children and homeless people on the bomb-blasted streets of Europe after the second world war. At the recommendation of the celebrated Robert Doisneau, who had seen her work, she was taken on by French <em>Vogue</em> in 1953 and sent out on fashion and portrait assignments. Often, as here, she found ways to make those two worlds collide. Commissioned to photograph the shop display of the department store Printemps, her camera was drawn to the man asleep on the pavement outside. The garden party of the window display, with this framing, became a kind of surrealist painting or a feverish hangover dream, random hats and chairs looming large.</p> <p>Weiss died at the end of last year, aged 97. This picture features in a new book and retrospective of her pioneering work, called <em>The Poetry of the Instant</em>. She lived for 70 years in a tiny studio behind some of the grander houses of Paris’s 16th arrondissement. In the evenings, often with her husband, the American painter Hugh Weiss, she would wander the neighbourhood in search of photographs. Aged 93, she noted that “I would never leave home telling myself, ‘I’m going to photograph some tramps today.’ Everything I did was a rapid and spontaneous reaction to what was going on around me.”</p> <p>Her camera gave her a passport to places and lives sometimes hard to access for a woman in the 1950s. She had a singular journalistic principle: “Whenever I saw a door marked with a no-entry sign, I always opened it.” The result, in thousands of images, was a kind of singular backstage vision of Paris as it tried to rediscover its humanity and heart after the war. </p> <ul> <li><p>Sabine Weiss: The Poetry of the Instant is at the <a href=\"https://www.treoci.org/it/2013-02-05-10-08-35/mostre-in-corso/588-sabine-weiss-la-poesia-dell-istante\">Casa dei Tre Oci</a>, Venice until 23 October, with an accompanying catalogue published by <a href=\"https://www.marsilioeditori.it/component/marsilio/scheda-libro/5463024/sabine-weiss?Itemid=165\">Marsilio</a> (£38)</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/14/albuquerque-muslims-reaction-murders","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Muslims relieved and bewildered after Albuquerque murders case arrest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/albuquerque-muslims-reaction-murders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/14/albuquerque-muslims-reaction-murders","fields":{"headline":"Muslims relieved and bewildered after Albuquerque murders case arrest","trailText":"Community members who kept to their own homes out of fear of a serial killer face possibility that killings may have been committed by one of their own","byline":"Erum Salam in Albuquerque, New Mexico","body":"<p>It was a modern-day murder mystery: who had killed four Muslim men in Albuquerque, New Mexico, since November?

And it also meant the deaths were not ignored, regardless of the victims’ national origin or faith, as some – including their loved ones – worried they might.</p> <p>Among those who fretted their relative’s death might be forgotten was 73-year-old Sharief Hadi, now the sole owner of Ariana, after his brother Mohammad “Zahir” Ahmadi, 62, was murdered there last year.</p> <p>The two brothers, originally from Afghanistan but longtime residents of Albuquerque, ran the grocery store and cafe for many years together before their partnership came to a tragic halt, he explained recently as he poured a cup of hot tea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"566ea86c80d2e1e72d8c956692d7a8eb642550c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/566ea86c80d2e1e72d8c956692d7a8eb642550c0/0_142_5832_3500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muslims worship during Friday prayers at the Islamic Center of New Mexico in Albuquerque.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muslims worship during Friday prayers at the Islamic Center of New Mexico in Albuquerque.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 7 November, Ahmadi went behind the store to smoke a cigarette when he was shot and killed.</p> <p>“This business was his hope,” Hadi said. “He loved this business. He cooked all the time for people. He was perfect.”</p> <p>Hadi remembers virtually every detail about the day Ahmadi was murdered. He recalls going home early to meet with a friend and seeing Ahmadi napping on a sofa in the cafe before he left – his last memory of his brother. He hasn’t forgotten the terrible chill that coursed through his body when a neighboring retailer called him and told him to check on his store – especially because Ahmadi had never made it home.</p> <p>When Hadi arrived, an officer told him, “Your brother’s killed himself.”</p> <p>“I said, ‘What you’re talking about?’” Hadi added, recounting how investigators took his brother’s body before he then tried to wipe up dried blood and brain matter that still remained.</p> <p>Hadi mourned. He installed a camera behind the store, near where an Afghan woman in a purple headscarf had molded dough into the large flatbread displayed in the storefront.</p> <p>He commiserated with a neighboring jeweler who identified herself only as Jennifer, a Native American woman with a dark, slicked-back braid who reported Ahmadi’s body to the police and – thoroughly unnerved – ditched plans to publicize her business.</p> <p>What disturbed her about Ahmadi’s violent death is that “he was … happy to be here,” she said, adding that he tried to teach her how to make the bread that the store sold. “He had a dream. He worked hard. He worked harder than some Americans.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, like Hadi, she feared investigators wouldn’t ever challenge the initial officer’s assumption that Ahmadi died by suicide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6af251a01c8aec06fdef9bf72c10c47e53217fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6af251a01c8aec06fdef9bf72c10c47e53217fb2/700_0_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That began to change when 41-year-old Aftab Hussein was shot to death less than three miles away from Ahmadi and Hadi’s store on 26 July.

All three men were Albuquerque residents from Pakistan. They were unrelated, but they had different variations of the same last name and were killed within just a few miles of each other.</p> <p>Authorities acknowledged their religious faith and national origin may have made them targets. That ignited rumors of a hate-fueled killing spree that could date back as far as the death of Ahmadi, in a state where hate crimes aimed at race and religion have the highest number of victims among other kinds reported hate crimes.</p> <p>Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/09/new-mexico-albuquerque-muslim-killings\">Joe Biden</a> weighed in.

Crime Stoppers and the Council on American Islamic Relations offered a combined reward of $30,000 for information leading to the murderer.</p> <p>Hundreds of tips about the car’s whereabouts poured in. On 9 August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/09/new-mexico-suspect-muslim-killings-albuquerque\">authorities spotted Syed</a> driving that vehicle 100 miles from New Mexico’s border with Texas and stopped him.

His past charges include assaulting his wife, his son and a man allegedly dating his daughter at the time, though prosecutors eventually dropped those cases.</p> <p>Hadi said he, his brother and their employees had trouble with Syed – a regular customer of their shop – before the spate of killings erupted.</p> <p>Independent of the charges against Syed, the Alzahra Islamic Center president, Mizan Kadhim, a former Lutheran Family Services caseworker whose organization helps refugees resettle in the area, said he was “shocked and disgusted” by his background.</p> <p>“When you come to this country, all you want to do is be successful and to live a peaceful life,” Kadhim said. “My mind never went to violence.”</p> <p>Kadhim – a refugee himself – wanted to give back to other refugees and the town he called home. He worked with Naeem Hussain at Lutheran Family Services. He said of all the killings in his community recently, that of his former friend and colleague hurt the most.</p> <p>“It just was like a huge relief for us when they caught [Syed] because the fear in the community was so big,” Kadhim added. “But the fear is still here. Some of my community members said they don’t know if there’s more of them … We never thought this is going to happen in America.”</p> <p>Kadhim is uniquely positioned to intensely feel the killings’ horror. He welcomed Syed when he first arrived in Albuquerque from Afghanistan nearly six years ago – and he did the same for some of the victims.</p> <p>He often made home visits to check in on Syed and his family when they were assigned to him. But while Kadhim said Syed “was not a nice person”, he never expected he would be accused of murder.</p> <p>Speculation about Syed’s possible motives for murder began to surface in news media around the country and from acquaintances. Kadhim said it was well-known that Syed, a Sunni Muslim, was greatly displeased with his daughter for marrying a Shia.</p> <p>Hussein and Hussain can be Shia surnames, and Ahmadi can be one, too. Community members say they suspect the last names possibly factored into the victim selection, though authorities have not officially confirmed that this was Syed’s motive.</p> <p>“He was going crazy over it,” Kadhim added.</p> <p>It’s an explanation that – if true – won’t ever sit well with Alaw Aldhilemi, a Shia Muslim who regularly patronizes the Sunni-owned Yasmine’s Cafe on Central Avenue, Albuquerque’s “Main Street”, sitting on a portion of Route 66, the historic US highway.</p> <p>Aldhilemi alluded to how Islam’s Sunni and Shia sects agree on most of the religion’s fundamentals, and the split essentially comes down to the sides’ beliefs over who should succeed the faith’s founder, the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>To most of the Muslims in Albuquerque, it’s a distinction hardly worth arguing over – much less killing for, Aldhilemi said.</p> <p>“We’re all Sunni and Shia here,” Aldhilemi added, gesturing at the entire restaurant. “But this guy … he’s not Shia. He’s not Sunni. He’s like people who don’t have brains.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Albuquerque’s Muslim community – Sunnis and Shias alike – stood together again on the first Friday since Syed’s arrest, shoulder to shoulder, as the civic plaza reverberated with the weekly call to prayer.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/14/beth-macy-dopesick-raising-lazarus-opioids-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘Listening to the people’: Beth Macy on the opioids crisis and her Dopesick sequel, Raising Lazarus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/14/beth-macy-dopesick-raising-lazarus-opioids-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/14/beth-macy-dopesick-raising-lazarus-opioids-crisis","fields":{"headline":"‘Listening to the people’: Beth Macy on the opioids crisis and her Dopesick sequel, Raising Lazarus","trailText":"What’s next, the author asks, now the US has ‘a generation of users that <em>started</em> with heroin and fentanyl’","byline":"Edward Helmore","body":"<p>Towards the end of her new book, Beth Macy swaps journalism for advocacy.

It became the touchstone account of a sprawling crisis of corporate malfeasance and regulatory mismanagement that largely eluded the criminal justice system despite killing about a million people.</p> <p>Raising Lazarus is more personal, and looks more closely at what can be done to solve the opioid abuse mess, even as it morphs away from the pharmaceutical industry mis-marketing that started it.</p> <p>“At this point, too much attention is focused on stemming the oversupply of prescription opioids,” Macy writes. “We now have a generation of drug users that <em>started</em> with heroin and fentanyl.”</p> <p>Macy reports on the people, often personally motivated and detached from any official policy response, whose central purpose is to get victims’ voices heard and to achieve accountability from companies and executives behind the flood of opioids, including Purdue Pharma and the members of the Sackler family, in the initial wave of the crisis.</p> <p>There are familiar figures. Nan Goldin, the photographer-activist who led a campaign to force museums to remove the Sackler name; the lawyer Mike Quinn, who led a campaign for victims’ voices to be heard in the Purdue bankruptcy; and Ed Bisch, an IT worker in New Jersey who lost his son to Oxycontin, who now works to hold the Sacklers accountable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It shouldn’t be that cutting-edge care is delivered by a guy in a Prius</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Everybody had different goals in mind but the main thing is how to get victims’ voices heard and how to get accountability,” Macy says. “As a society we have made it so hard to hold rich people that break the law accountable.”</p> <p>Fentanyl manufacturing runs from precursors sourced in India and formulated in China to distribution via Mexico to the US. What used to come in labelled plastic pill bottles with child-proof lids now comes in 50-gallon drums.

Given the scale of the problem, there is no magic bullet. Macy consults Richard Nixon’s drug tsar, Dr Jerome Jaffe, architect of the first US comprehensive drug addiction services plan, still working in his 90s.</p> <p>Jaffe tells her: “It’s not easy to come up with something that’s cost-efficient and easy to scale up, and is both acceptable to the public and to those people that have this problem.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2bd75ca32799c97c6e05644f42fc7c54b6120985\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd75ca32799c97c6e05644f42fc7c54b6120985/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dopesick’s showrunner, Danny Strong, with Macy at a rally in Washington DC in December 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dopesick’s showrunner, Danny Strong, with Macy at a rally in Washington DC in December 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But traces of a possible solution do emerge, within profiles of heroic activists and pioneers, among them Karen Lowe and the Rev Michelle Mathis, who run North Carolina’s Olive Branch Ministry, the nation’s only biracial, queer, faith-based harm-reduction group.</p> <p>There is Mark Willis, a state opioid response director and drug court advocate, or Tim Nolan, driving around in a Toyota Prius, ferrying patients to rehab or hospital, handing out syringes and Naloxone, an anti-overdose agent, in truck-stop parking lots or abandoned buildings, to those most at risk of dying.</p> <p>“I thought, let’s show these people doing heroic things, fighting barriers and stigma, and a lot of the time succeeding,” Macy says. “The stories are inspiring, gritty and interesting.</p> <p>“You can see what they do and, honestly, it shouldn’t be that cutting-edge care is delivered by a guy in a Prius.

The problem, he said, was that these details “don’t tell us that much. What you want is a gesture that tells you something particular.”</p> <p>Natalia Ginzburg seems to me to be a master of the gesture that tells you something particular. In her 1952 novel <em>All Our Yesterdays</em>, the latest welcome reissue of her work by Daunt Books, there are many, many characters, but each is drawn with beautiful particularity. The father of one of the two central families is writing his memoirs, titled Nothing But the Truth, which “contained fiery attacks on the fascists and the king. The old man used to laugh and rub his hands together at the thought that the king and Mussolini knew nothing about it, while in a small town in Italy there was a man writing fiery remarks about them.” Everyone gets this loving treatment: even a local dog is “curly haired and stupid”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sally Rooney, in her introduction, says she hopes readers new to Ginzburg will fall in love with her</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The setting is 1930s northern Italy, where the central character, 16-year-old Anna, navigates life and love via her family and the family in the house opposite. The texture of the story is of domestic life – friendships rising and falling; a pregnancy; a marriage of convenience – but all the while the war is beginning to darken the blue skies.</p> <p>Ginzburg’s brilliance is to render the war as background, a secondary topic of conversation, hinted at through Anna’s limited knowledge. Yet it is unignorable – her sister’s boyfriend, Danilo, is jailed for spreading seditious literature – even when the effect is comic, such as villagers refusing to take fascists seriously because they know one of them as the local chemist’s son. “He would do better to come back behind the counter and weigh things on his little pair of scales again.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/30/sally-rooney-book-transformed-her-life-all-our-yesterdays-natalia-ginzburg\">Sally Rooney</a>, in her introduction to this edition, says she hopes readers new to Ginzburg will fall in love with her through <em>All Our Yesterdays</em>, but for me this is not the book for Ginzburg newcomers. The manner of telling – long paragraphs, run-on sentences and little direct speech – and the way the story flits from character to character, viewpoints overlapping like tiles on a roof, makes for a dense reading experience, though a rewarding one.

Pressburger is best known as the screenwriting half of one of the last century’s great film-making duos: along with Michael Powell he produced masterpiece after masterpiece in the 1940s, from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/20/life-death-colonel-blimp-review\">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</a></em> to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/13/red-shoes-powell-pressburger-shearer\">The Red Shoes</a></em>.</p> <p><em>The Glass Pearls</em>, his second novel, is less innovative structurally than his screen work: it’s a fairly straight suspense story. Where the novelty comes in – and reputedly contributed to the book’s failure when first published – is that the central character, to whose hopes the reader must lash themselves for the narrative to work, is a war criminal on the run.</p> <p>It’s 1965 and Karl Braun – formerly Dr Otto Reitmüller – is living low in London, eking out a living as a piano tuner. His position in rented lodgings gives the book the air of a classic boarding-house novel, where lives are tumbled together: in Braun’s case, he meets other German émigrés, who assume he fled Hitler as they (and indeed Pressburger himself) did. In fact, Braun was a Nazi doctor, experimenting enthusiastically on concentration camp prisoners. (“Another bit of their brain was snipped off.”)</p> <p>If Braun seems to have no regret about the horrors he enacted, he is at least traumatised by the deaths of his wife and child, who were killed in Operation Gomorrah, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Hamburg_in_World_War_II\">allied bombing of Hamburg in July 1943</a>. His mental equilibrium begins to be overturned: he finds he is the No 1 target for the German authorities, becomes more and more paranoid about informers, distrusts his lover and finally decides to flee to the safety of Argentina.</p> <p>Pressburger doesn’t make us want Braun to succeed exactly, but he expertly ramps up the tension so we simply must find out which deserved outcome lies ahead, as Braun gets closer to escaping Europe and justice and simultaneously learns more about how close they are to catching him.

Is this common?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Not really – even Scotland has state-run water facilities. It is unusual for water provision to be run entirely privately. Many European countries, such as France, have their utilities run by private-public partnerships. In others, such as Spain, the issue is somewhat devolved, with some cities served by private companies and the rest of the country by a public water supply.</p> <p>Proponents of public ownership say that water is such an important resource that there should be accountability. The government must be able to take control in a crisis. Some point to the rather strange situation we have in England, where the government is urging water companies to put in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/12/yorkshire-water-announces-hosepipe-ban-after-record-low-rainfall\">hosepipe bans</a>, but is powerless to force them to do so – and they refuse.</p> <p><strong>Q: So the UK government can’t force water companies to do anything. What does this mean for supply?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The grand idea behind privatisation is that it makes a profit, which can be ploughed back into infrastructure, giving us shiny new pipes, loads of reservoirs and absolutely no leaks. Obviously, this hasn’t been the case – shareholders have become incredibly wealthy off the back of water companies in England and Wales because much of the profit is used to pay them, rather than to update our infrastructure. There is an exception in Welsh Water (<em>Dŵr Cymru</em>), which is a not-for-profit company.</p> <p>The Angling Trust has been campaigning for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/13/we-need-reservoirs-built-drought-leaves-uk-farms-begging-for-government-aid\">new reservoirs</a> so that we don’t have to keep sucking our precious chalk streams dry – but the last time a major reservoir was built was before privatisation.</p> <p>Reservoirs are expensive to build, and it would cost billions to update our pipes so that they stop leaking. This has resulted in us having an infrastructure that was built to sustain the population of a few decades ago, rather than the larger one we have now.</p> <p><strong>Q: So in France, where only 9,000 people are served solely by private water companies rather than public-private partnerships or publicly owned companies, they must be absolutely swimming in water?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Not exactly. This year, France has been hit badly by the European drought and has put water restrictions in place across the whole country. It is partly because of the public control of water that the government is able to do this, but they are also faring a lot worse in terms of supply.</p> <p>This week, 100 villages were without running water, meaning they had to get their supply from state-provided tanks parked in the town centres.</p> <p>France is a large country, and it is hard at the best of times to move water around from wetter areas to drier ones, especially when the issue is devolved and you have different muncipalities treating water differently.</p> <p><strong>Q: What about leaks? How bad are we compared to other countries?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Leakage is a problem across Europe. Much as private companies don’t fancy ripping up roads to replace pipes, governments also want to save money and not cause disruption. Italian government ministers recently claimed that up to 42 per cent of water supply is lost through pipes. In England it is about a quarter, according to recent analysis. In Ireland, where water is nationalised, Dublin recently topped the leaderboard of worst leakage of any European city.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is it </strong><strong>cheaper for countries with </strong><strong>less privatisation?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> When the government has some control over the water supply, it can keep prices from spiralling out of control.

But now this old branch, known as Peggy, has become weak and unsafe so I decided it was high time she ‘boughed out’, so I have duly lopped her.”</p> <p>Also last week came the announcement of the departure of the queen of the tennis court for more than 20 years, Serena Williams. In a <em>Vogue</em> interview, the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion, now aged 40, announced: “I am evolving away from tennis… I’m ready for what’s next.” The reason for retirement from the sport in her case will be no surprise to many women: namely, you can’t have it all. At least, not on the terms currently on offer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>If I were a guy… I would be out there playing while my wife would be doing the physical labour of expanding our family</p> <footer> <cite>Serena Williams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Williams explains in the September issue of the magazine that she never wanted to choose between tennis and a family but she is hoping for a second child. “I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy… I would be out there playing and winning while my wife would be doing the physical labour of expanding our family.” The mother of five-year-old Olympia <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-retirement-in-her-own-words\" title=\"\">said</a>: “I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete.”</p> <p>Once, not so long ago, an employee served his or her 30 or 40 years in the same job and retired with a carriage clock, only to peg out a few years later. Work-life balance and rearing a family were part of the invisible world in which most employers had little interest and next to no investment.</p> <p>For decades, women lobbied for more flexibility in the workplace, a three-day week without forfeiting a career and almost nothing changed. Family commitments and astronomical childcare costs meant that, for many, early “retirement” was not so much a choice as an imposition. Then came Covid-19.</p> <p>Working from home became the norm, “lost” hours from commuting were found again, thousands of employees tasted a form of semi-liberation from the rat race and the result has been that, while the work ethic is alive, it’s apparently far from well. Last week, Dame Sharon White, the chair of John Lewis, made a plea for the one million people, mostly aged between 50 and 70, who left paid employment during the pandemic to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/09/get-over-50s-back-to-work-to-tackle-uk-labour-shortage-says-john-lewis-boss?\" title=\"\">return to the labour market</a>. She said that many of those leaving employed work could cause “profound, long-term systemic implications”, resulting in low productivity and rates of growth. Of course, economic hardship may force some back – but in the social contract between employers and bosses a great deal is amiss, so why wouldn’t many choose to call it a day on a life of labour that too often currently brings so few rewards?</p> <p>A recent PCS union survey of <a href=\"https://www.pcs.org.uk/news-events/news/survey-results-show-extent-members-struggles\" title=\"\">12,000 mainly junior civil servants</a> found that 40% had to take out a loan or credit to pay for essential shopping, 9% were claiming benefits to top up their income and 14% had taken second and third jobs to make ends meet. In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that a 15-hour paid working week would be made possible in the 21st century by improved productivity and technology. Instead, for many, the working week has grown longer, prospects are insecure, frequent career/job change is an expectation and wages have flatlined for years as inflation and energy bills have soared. Against that backdrop, some have had early retirement forced on them by redundancy, sickness or family commitments, while for others it isn’t so much a choice as a straightforward trade-off: live a more frugal life but for a few years longer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a6444ae51001d4aac7f4b8b82693eaa9ba273098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6444ae51001d4aac7f4b8b82693eaa9ba273098/1537_508_2827_3533/800.jpg\" alt=\"June Spencer, photographed in 2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">June Spencer, photographed in 2019, is retiring from The Archers, at the age of 103.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The impact of Covid on employment practices means that, in spite of the demands of some politicians and economists to delay the official retirement age to 67 and older, for many, when to opt out is increasingly becoming a personal decision. For the June Spencers of this world, able to control their working hours, in love with what they do, retirement may never be an option. Others may feel unable to surrender the identity and status they believe their job bestows – but what of those in “dirty” or distressing work, a shift in an abattoir or a building site or an overstretched hospital A&amp;E?

Subsidised affordable childcare, reasonable hours, a fair wage, flexibility, in-work skills training and respect are obvious requirements. The Social Market Foundation, a thinktank, recently published a <a href=\"https://www.smf.co.uk/publications/capital-concerns/\" title=\"\">report</a> on London’s working poor. All participants said that businesses ought to be “ more understanding, caring and proactive”.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/12/salman-rushdie-attacked-onstage-new-york\" title=\"\">violent attack</a> on Rushdie on Friday was not just a heinous attempt on the life of one of the world’s most insightful storytellers but an attack on the right to disagree, on liberal democracy and on freedom itself.</p> <p>Even more shocking than the fatwa, issued when democracy looked ascendant, was the failure of democracy’s defenders to stand alongside Rushdie as he was forced into hiding for almost a decade and his associates were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/15/salman-rushdie-i-am-stupidly-optimistic-it-got-me-through-those-bad-years\" title=\"\">murdered by fanatics</a>. Many so-called liberals, including senior British politicians, appeared more concerned to express sympathy with those he offended or to say why they disagreed with him than to unequivocally condemn those who called for his death or burned his novel <em>The Satanic Verses</em> in an attempt to get it banned in Britain.</p> <p>When Rushdie was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jun/16/books.politics\" title=\"\">awarded a knighthood</a> for services to literature 18 years later, some argued it was a grievous misstep, as if the offended should have the power of veto over the celebration of exquisite talent.</p> <p>Rushdie has fiercely resisted attempts to define him through the threats to his life but he has become one of the most powerful champions of free expression in the face of the increasingly censorious cultures that have been allowed to flourish on the political right and left in countries such as the US and the UK. Even as people die fighting for their freedom in parts of the world, free expression rights are regarded by too many not as precious things to be defended against erosion, but to be taken for granted as won and banked.</p> <p>Yet as the British writer Hanif Kureishi <a href=\"https://kenanmalik.com/2011/04/06/nobody-would-have-the-balls/\" title=\"\">observed</a>: “Nobody would have the balls today to write <em>The Satanic Verses</em>, let alone publish it.” When the French satirical magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> was awarded a freedom of expression courage award by <a href=\"https://pen.org/about-us/\" title=\"\">PEN America</a> a few months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/09/-sp-charlie-hebdo-timeline-events\" title=\"\">eight of its staff and four other people, including two policemen, were murdered in Paris</a> by Islamist terrorists on 7 January 2015, more than 200 prominent writers wrote to PEN, criticising it for “<a href=\"https://pen.org/pen-receives-letter-from-members-about-charlie-hebdo-award/\" title=\"\">valorising selectively offensive material</a>”. In France, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/17/teacher-decapitated-in-paris-named-as-samuel-paty-47\" title=\"\">teacher was decapitated</a> in October 2020 after using satirical cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in his lessons; in Britain, a teacher has been <a href=\"https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/year-prophet-muhammad-batley-school-23493076\" title=\"\">forced into hiding</a> as a result to threats to his life in similar circumstances. Threats of violence against those challenging religious and secular ideologies have become commonplace. While the government has hugely expanded the powers of the police over the right to protest, British courts have ruled that police forces have been unlawfully threatening individuals expressing views on far-from-settled <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Miller-v-College-of-Policing-judgment-201221.pdf\" title=\"\">contemporary debates</a>, and noted that bad-faith claims of bigotry are being weaponised to silence dissenters. Two years ago, Rushdie was the co-signatory of an important <a href=\"https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/\" title=\"\">letter</a> that warned of the consequences of growing societal intolerance of dissent.</p> <p>Rushdie has paid a devastating price for his defence of free expression. Let this attempt on his life be what shocks complacent liberals out of their stupor. “The moment you declare a set of ideas to be immune from criticism, satire, derision, or contempt, freedom of thought becomes impossible,” <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/article_2331jsp/\" title=\"\">he said in 2005</a>.

We are third-generation immigrants, both our grandparents being Italian and settling in London. We have been raised in a British-Italian household sharing values from both, but never feeling as if we fit into either identity.</em></p> <p><em>Being removed by two generations from our grandparents, and not speaking Italian, makes us feel as if we are not Italian, and that we are removed from this community. On the other hand, we don’t feel </em><em>English, resulting in </em><em>a lack of national and cultural identity. Thus, we feel a loneliness which is only furthered by us being removed from other family members who perhaps experience the same problem.</em></p> <p><em>Although we have tried reaching out to Italian communities, often the language barrier makes us feel even more isolated and there seems to be a lack of conversation</em><em> surrounding the experience of being third-generation immigrants, making us doubt that we can even make it part of our Italian identity. It feels as if the only thing that gives validity to this identity is our mother, who refuses to engage with this subject, and therefore this feeling is one that is external, and will unfortunately end with her. So I guess our question is, what can we do to end this feeling of isolation and lack of identity?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>The physical feeling of being a “foreign” body in both lands, and carrying culture norms and mores from both, is difficult to navigate, so it is not surprising you have some feelings of disconnection.</p> <p>It struck me that your mother won’t engage with you and your sister on this subject. Her parents may have been in the Second World War, they may have lost property, people and livelihoods, so I imagine there is pain and trauma back there and I’m wondering whether this has been passed down to you and your sister via your mother. It may be that to talk about Italy, as an Italian, to talk to you in Italian, to share with you what it feels like to her to be Italian while having to be in Britain is too painful to think about. There is some mystery there and maybe your mother can’t explain it but only feel it.</p> <p>It could be that she has passed down this feeling of not belonging to you and it may seem to her that the best way of curing it is to deny it, meaning you and your sister are pushed away when you try to go there. My fantasy is that she wants you to be British women so that you don’t get this feeling of being in two cultures while not belonging to either of them. But if this was her plan, it has not worked. I’m only guessing but I feel there is a sense of disconnect in your mother around identity and belonging, and this has unintentionally been passed to you. I’m sorry she did not speak Italian to you when you were babies, or that your grandparents didn’t; it would have helped, I think, to have the two languages.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trauma felt by parents can affect children and even grand-children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I have worked with second-generation immigrants, they say they feel, like you, neither one thing nor the other. In this country, they are seen as being from the country their parents came from, but when they go back to the land of their parents they are called British, without feeling that they are either. Transgenerational or intergenerational trauma is when the experiences of parents affect the development of children and even grandchildren. Researchers don’t completely understand this type of trauma but have noted it changes not only the way parents are with their children, but how certain genes are expressed in future generations. This may explain further why you and your sister feel anchorless and as though you do not belong anywhere. But what practical steps can you take?</p> <p>Learning Italian may help – especially if you watch Italian films, read Italian books and get into the rhythm of the language and really embody it. I think it will bring you closer to the culture, even if you never get fluent. This is not an easy task, but you can do it together and then you’ll have company.</p> <p>A Spanish-British friend told me that she calls herself a “Londoner”, as she feels such an identity embraces so many cultures. You are Italian-British, British-Italian, but I think you have been pushed away a little from the Italian, not only because of possible trauma in previous generations but perhaps because your mother was somehow made to feel ashamed of being an immigrant. I think people should be proud of taking the bold step to emigrate, but it could be a reason why she seems to not want to engage about being an Italian in Britain.</p> <p>You belong here on this Earth, the world is your home, but I understand you want to feel more at home. What you and your sister feel is typical, so you are having a very normal, human response to the situation.</p> <p><em><strong>Book recommendation </strong>The Bridge: Dialogues Across Cultures edited by Talia Levine Bar-Yoseph (Gestalt Press)</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/14/griller-thrillers-the-best-wines-for-a-summer-barbecue","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Griller thrillers: the best wines for a summer barbecue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/14/griller-thrillers-the-best-wines-for-a-summer-barbecue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/14/griller-thrillers-the-best-wines-for-a-summer-barbecue","fields":{"headline":"Griller thrillers: the best wines for a summer barbecue","trailText":"From juicy, smoky reds to oaky whites, here are the best bottles to crack open when you fire up the BBQ","byline":"David Williams","body":"<p><strong>Kanonkop Kadette Pinotage, Stellenbosch, South Africa 2019 </strong><strong>(from </strong><strong>£12.99, <a href=\"https://www.waitrosecellar.com/kanonkop-kadette-pinotage-706694\" title=\"\">Waitrose</a></strong><strong>; </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.majestic.co.uk/wines/kanonkop-kadette-pinotage-20318\" title=\"\">majestic.co.uk</a></strong><strong>)</strong><em> </em>To judge from the smells wafting around my street over the past few hot weeks, a lot of people have been using their barbecues more than their cookers this summer. It’s a decision I endorse: it’s much more pleasant to cook in the open air than endure the patience- and temper-fraying heat of a kitchen in 40C, or even 30C, heat. Even when it becomes close to habitual, there’s something of the special occasion about cooking on a flaming grill – an excuse, if it were needed, for opening a bottle of something nicer than usual. While I don’t really believe in the marketing concept of the ‘barbie bottle’ – a wine uniquely suited to a barbecue no matter what grilled proteins, salads, or sauces are being served – the smoky flavours of barbecued food do seem to work better with some wines than others. There’s a subtle smoky twang among the brambly fruit, for example, in Kanonkop’s superior pinotage that fits very snugly with smoke-infused burgers and bangers.</p> <p><strong>Viña Mayu Titon Vineyard Syrah Gran Reserva, Elqui, Chile 2017 </strong>(<strong>£13.99, <a href=\"https://www.majestic.co.uk/wines/kanonkop-kadette-pinotage-20318\">Majestic</a></strong><strong>)</strong> Succulent reds with a bit of spice, herb or smoke, and which have enough body, depth and force without being too chewily tannic or dry: these are the elements that seem to work best with simply seasoned barbecued red meat. The classic southern French varieties grenache and syrah – whether on their own, as a duo, or as part of a blend with other varieties such as mourvèdre or carignan – are among the best at providing this combination. I’ve enjoyed Château La Négly La Clape 2020 (£12.99, <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Co-op</a>), a wonderful blackberry-juicy syrah-grenache-mourvèdre from the Languedoc shot through with dark salty olive and rosemary; and the good-value southern Rhône Valley blend <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/specially-selected-french-cairanne/p/717968608058400\" title=\"\">Aldi </a>Specially Selected Cairanne 2020 (£8.99) with its tumble of black pepper-seasoned berries and plums.

My preferred speedy post-work barbecue method of briefly marinating a piece of white meat, some prawns or a few slabs of halloumi with lime juice and sweet chilli sauce works best with citrus-driven dry whites, such as the livewire limey, zesty Western Australian, <a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/260051253\" title=\"\">Tesco</a> Finest Tingleup Riesling 2021 (£9).

Snacks and small plates £7.50-£22, large plates £16-£40, desserts £9-£16, wines from £36</strong></p> <p>Early on in our dinner at Fallow on London’s Haymarket, a waiter delivers a mushroom parfait to our table and then points up at a shelf suspended from the industrially scaffolded ceiling. Gnarled, fungally embellished logs are sitting up there. “And we even grow some of the mushrooms for this dish right here at the restaurant,” he says. Even allowing for the restaurant’s noisily proclaimed commitment to sustainability, this could be a profoundly annoying outbreak of virtue signalling, were it not for one thing. That mushroom parfait is astonishing. The furious blizzard of shitake and oyster is as smooth as velvet stroked the right way. It’s as deep as a Samuel Beckett play, and as rich as Rockefeller. It surprises me not at all that dairy has been involved, along with separated eggs: yolks for the fat, whipped whites for the aeration.</p> <p>It is glorious to eat but could also, I think, replace my <a href=\"https://www.kiehls.co.uk/mens/collections/facial-fuel?gclid=Cj0KCQjw852XBhC6ARIsAJsFPN1rilpPc6Na8R8Xg_VugEFA3vDG_PWFS0yxWgI0wexYH551X2aLEPYaAr-xEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" title=\"\">Kiehl’s</a> Facial Fuel habit as a moisturiser; just rub it in and keep rubbing. Astonishingly though, I believe it is pound for pound more expensive than the Kiehl’s. I like to think that the £17 price tag for this small plate of mushroom pâté is partly to recoup the significant research and development costs, like it was some new pharmaceutical. Certainly, it makes me feel better about the world. So no, Fallow is not cheap, but it really is all kinds of “Gosh” and “Wow” and “Oh my!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ac9271e202facfe07c415cc6168695180ba523c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac9271e202facfe07c415cc6168695180ba523c/0_179_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Eye intact’: cod’s head with sriracha butter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Eye intact’: cod’s head with sriracha butter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chefs Jack Croft and Will Murray met at Dinner by Heston, which is interesting because prior to their mushroom parfait, the best I’d tried had been the vegetarian alternative to Blumenthal’s famed meat fruit. This really is better (and, as it happens, cheaper). The two chefs bonded over a desire to elevate the humble and use the bits that others throw away. An extended pop-up led eventually last autumn to this hard-edged corner site: there are polished floors and red leather banquettes, marble counters and, dangling from the ceiling, bundles of kelp and heather. In the open kitchen, flames leap.</p> <p>On one of those excruciatingly hot evenings the glass walls have been pulled back and there is a tumble and buzz about the place. It reminds me of those New York restaurants which reject the arch formality and curtsying of the sort that usually frames cooking of this quality, preferring instead to knock out plate after plate of the good stuff. Some of it is delivered by the extremely knowledgable waiters, the rest by the chefs themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d789e3161a1caa33450ee752d69386e26cbcd4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d789e3161a1caa33450ee752d69386e26cbcd4e/89_397_5101_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Almost toffee-like’: corn cob slices.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Almost toffee-like’: corn cob slices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One particular strength is seasonings. Slices of corn cob, curled in on themselves from a long swim in the deep fat fryer that has made the kernels almost toffee-like, come dusted with a salty-sour kombu-boosted mix. It is a bar snack wearing a zoot suit and spats, to be eaten as if they were baby-back ribs. A similarly addictive salty-sour seasoning has been used on long-smoked beef short ribs, in a sauce overcoat, that come away from the bone with a tug of the teeth. Intriguingly, two fat ribs are only £12, which is not far off the retail price. Yes, the pricing can seem a little uneven at times.</p> <p>Among these early dishes there is a “tartiflette” flatbread. It’s a pillowy, heat-inflated disc of crisp crusted brioche laden with slabs of reblochon cheese, caramelised onions and cornichon: all the ingredients, bar the potatoes, that the reblochon trade body came up with when looking for a dish with which to flog their product back in the 80s. Next comes picked white crab on a crunchy salad of shredded cabbage. Underneath is a smooth purée of jerusalem artichoke. Poured around this heap of loveliness is a toasty chilli broth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d91eebf684947ea8a54a0768487a29611db2f15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d91eebf684947ea8a54a0768487a29611db2f15/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘A pillowy, heat-inflated disc’: tartiflette flatbread.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A pillowy, heat-inflated disc’: tartiflette flatbread.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do try their take on leeks vinaigrette which, unlike the classic, is served warm. The logs of leek have been smoked until soft. The dish is encouragingly drenched in a thick vinaigrette then topped with fried breadcrumbs. It’s a hefty portion, as it should be for £22, to be shared and fought over with friends. The menu is strong on non-meat dishes like this, although it does have a list of cuts from one-time dairy cows; animals that have given their all to the milk business and finally given their all once again. If you don’t approve of dairy or meat eating, none of this narrative will change your mind. But the idea of animals which have served in one way, being served in another makes sense.</p> <p>The dish that has garnered most attention and which will split the crowd is the cod’s head with sriracha butter sauce. It’s as described: a cod’s head, the bit of the fish that might otherwise be thrown away, eye intact, slow-grilled until the skin has taken on a sweet chewiness, then drenched in a tangerine-coloured sauce with the light kick of chilli and garlic. You are invited to pick around to find the meat – not just the familiar cheeks, but those bits around the jawline and the eye socket and beyond. I find myself feeling about my own well-upholstered face. There really might be some good eating there. There are two views here: this is either the very worst of overwrought London restaurant hipsterism, or there’s the opinion of those who have tried it which is that it’s a bloody good, delicious and totally involving idea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"279b4c9e5866a4489fa90c8f2c8c93268d316306\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/279b4c9e5866a4489fa90c8f2c8c93268d316306/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Copper-coloured crème’: tart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Copper-coloured crème’: tart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the desserts the best of those we try is a tart deep-filled with a copper-coloured crème made with whey that has been slowly caramelised over almost three days. Essentially, it’s a grown-up version of condensed milk. A chocolate mousse with various bits of mushroom and black truffle feels like the kitchen becoming a little too clever for its own good. I find myself muttering the word “interesting” over it. That’s never a good thing.</p> <p>My only other criticism is of the comprehensive wine list, which starts at £36 a bottle and has nothing below £9 a glass. It makes the entry point for an already less-than-cheap restaurant unnecessarily more expensive. It is possible to find good wines at less excruciating prices for those on a budget. This aside, Fallow really is serving some of the best food I’ve tried in London right now. The sustainability stuff is great. Let’s put the mushroom show on, right here in the barn. Let’s use the bits others chuck away. But none of that matters if your pricey dinner isn’t memorable. At Fallow, it really is. </p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>Chef Adam Reid of The French at the Midland Hotel in Manchester has announced a new, rather less fancy venture in the city. The Butty Shop will be a take-away food outlet at the redeveloped New Century Hall, a self-styled ‘social destination’ inside a Grade II listed building on Mayes Street. Reid’s all-day menu will apparently focus on traditional sandwiches. It plans ‘to bring the British butty back to life, with classic Northern flavours built on the memories of childhood visits to the bakery.’ There will be pickled eggs. At <em><a href=\"https://adam-reid.co.uk/\">adam-reid.co.uk.</a></em></p> <p>The Brazilian chef Alberto Landgraf, who holds a brace of Michelin stars at Oteque in Rio de Janeiro, is bringing his food back to London, where he started his career with the likes of Gordon Ramsay and Tom Aikens.

By Michael Segalov","byline":"Michael Segalov","body":"<p>By the late 1980s New York City’s epidemic of crack cocaine use was in full swing. Having arrived in the US at the start of the decade, this highly addictive cocaine composite – more affordable than its powdered form – had quickly created a national crisis. There were also fears that this lethal drug might soon be used on a similar scale across the pond. So in October 1987, the <em>Observer Magazine </em>took to the streets of Harlem and Manhattan, meeting those fighting on all fronts against crack cocaine’s devastating consequences: law enforcement, healthcare workers, and 81-year-old Clara ‘Mother’ Hale, who ran a clinic for children whose parents had been consumed by addiction.</p> <p>Certainly, 35 years on, New York and American drug use have evolved hugely. Descriptions of dealers communicating with teams of lookouts via walkie-talkie on Lower East Side streets likened to ‘drugs bazaars’ would be hard to find in the gentrified district today. But what’s striking is how little has changed when it comes to society’s dismal failure to tackle the plague of addiction. Still, gaps left by the state are filled by volunteers and charity work. Then and now, policing of substances – and the sympathies extended to those affected – is shaped by inequality and racial bias. As Mother Hale put it: ‘The United States could have stopped drugs years ago. But they didn’t want to, because they thought it was only the Black and the Hispanics.’</p> <p>And, of course, there’s the futility of criminalising addiction. So little has changed. Drugs continue to be available on both sides of the Atlantic to those who desire them; the justice system is still ‘clogged’ with people who need access to healthcare. As Maria, a 17-year-old drug courier, explained then: ‘[the authorities] are chasing it. But it goes somewhere else. It’s like a dog chasing a cat. The dealers just keep moving it.’</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/13/salman-rushdie-attack-chautauqua-institution-michael-hill","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Rushdie stabbing was ‘an attack on who we are’, says venue’s president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/salman-rushdie-attack-chautauqua-institution-michael-hill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/13/salman-rushdie-attack-chautauqua-institution-michael-hill","fields":{"headline":"Rushdie stabbing was ‘an attack on who we are’, says venue’s president","trailText":"Head of Chautauqua Institution, which seeks to built interfaith connections, profoundly shaken by Friday’s violence","byline":"Ed Pilkington in Chautauqua, New York","body":"<p>At 10.45am on Friday, Michael Hill, the president of Chautauqua Institution, was sitting four rows back from the stage as Salman Rushdie was being introduced as a headline speaker in the cultural center’s summer programme.</p> <p>It should have been a joyous occasion for more than 1,000 people in the hall, and for Hill personally.

The institution lies in a heavily rural area replete with cornfields, Amish farms and 30 vineyards serving New York’s burgeoning wine industry.</p> <p>If farm products are one staple of the area, the other is comedy – Lucille Ball was born nearby, and the National Comedy Center is located in the closest larger town, Jamestown.</p> <p>At the center of Chautauqua Institution’s efforts is the aspiration to build inter-faith connections. Its 19th-century roots were as a Methodist training camp for Sunday school teachers, but in recent decades it has widened its ambitions to tackle some of the toughest religious and communal conflicts on the planet.</p> <p>“We welcome people of all faiths and none,” Hill said.</p> <p>There is a strong Christian and Jewish presence in the community, and a growing emphasis on reaching out to Muslims. The summer season includes a programme on “Islam 101” and there are regular dialogues attempting to unite Jews and Muslims.</p> <p>The calendar for next week includes an interfaith talk billed as “Being the change – a leap of faith”. It features the founders of a network of Muslim and Jewish women, Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom.</p> <p>Against that tradition, Friday’s attack came as a violation. “This was principally an attack on Mr Rushdie, who we continue to hold in prayer,” Hill said. “But it was also an attack on the very foundation of who we are and what we stand for. At the core, for us, it was an attempt at silencing.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/who-is-salman-rushdie-author-whose-book-the-satanic-verses-made-him-a-target\">Who is Salman Rushdie?

Could more have been done to protect Rushdie?</p> <p>Hill declined to address specific security concerns, such as whether there should have been walk-through metal detectors – or staffers equipped with metal-detecting wands – installed to catch the knife used by the attacker. He stressed there had been extensive planning with state and local authorities before the summer season began and that “we put in place what we believed was appropriate security for the event”.</p> <p>Did he have regrets?</p> <p>He said: “It’s natural we are asking, ‘Could we have done anything differently?’ The reality is that a 24-year-old was committed to enacting violence on an individual, and he found a way to get there. I regret that.”</p> <p>A review is now under way of security at all upcoming events. That includes Monday’s lecture by Jamie Raskin, the Democratic member of Congress from Maryland who is a key figure on the US House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack.</p> <p>Raskin will be speaking as part of a series of talks that the institution is calling “new profiles in courage”. He will be addressing the political challenges of January 6 but also the courage he has had to mine as the father of Tommy Raskin, who in December 2020 took his own life, aged 25.</p> <p>Hill said the institution was celebrating individuals who have stood up for what is right despite great adversity, an all the more urgent theme in the wake of Friday’s attack. “That is how Mr Rushdie has spent his whole life, and we are very hopeful he will continue to do so,” he added.</p> <p>Chautauqua Institution now finds itself grappling with exactly the conundrum that has loomed over Rushdie since the fatwa against his life was issued in 1989 – how do you stay true to your values, and live your best life, when faced with constant danger? “We are asking the same awful question,” Hill said.</p> <p>He went on: “Mr Rushdie gives us the answer. He tells us: you can be terrorised if you allow yourself to hide from the terror.”</p> <p>The way to respond to the violence unleashed on Rushdie and his community, Hill said, was to do the opposite – to reinforce the bridge-building mission.</p> <p>He said: “I have a deep sadness for what has happened here, and that’s precisely why we have to push forward.

By every scientific estimate, our hothouse future is going to be one of increasingly unpleasant extremes: more intense heatwaves, rising summer temperatures, more violent storms, rising sea levels – and, of course, worsening droughts. These impacts are baked into the future, scientists have repeatedly warned us. Thanks to the huge amounts of greenhouse gases we have already pumped into the atmosphere, we have no way of avoiding these changes. We can only try to cope with them.</p> <p>Our response to the current severe water shortages therefore gives us a chance to assess how well we are preparing for the meteorological mayhem ahead. In short, can we gain some confidence about our ability to fight climate change from the way our water companies are attempting to battle the drought that is now afflicting the country? The answer is straightforward and depressing. If the water industry in England is anything to go by, we look woefully unfit for the coming battle.</p> <p>Certainly, the images of parched grasslands and empty reservoirs that have filled our TV screens and newspapers for the past week indicate that we have learned very little about the business of maintaining a proper national water supply. No substantial reservoir has been constructed in England since the Kielder Water dam was built in 1981. Thus, our capacity to store fresh water has remained static as demand for it has risen steadily with the growth of the population.</p> <p>This inability to match water storage to the needs of the population has had grim knock-on effects. First, it has forced us to pump ever more water from groundwater sources. This has stressed aquifers, lowered the water table in many areas and threatened chalk streams. This last hazard is particularly vexing because chalk streams are some of the planet’s rarest habitats – and the vast majority are in England.</p> <p>Failing to collect and store water is also vexing given that the UK is becoming wetter. An early impact of climate change has meant that the period 2011-2020 was <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/understanding-climate/uk-and-global-extreme-events-heavy-rainfall-and-floods\">9% wetter</a>, in terms of rainfall, than the period 1961-1990. So there is no shortage of water we can collect. Unfortunately, it seems we just lack the urge to do so.</p> <p>Then, when we do manage to obtain and store water, we waste it. England’s largest water and wastewater service provider Thames Water, which supplies drinking water to 9 million customers in London and the Thames Valley, has admitted that it is losing more than more than 600m litres of water a day. That is enough to fill 240 Olympic swimming pools and is almost a quarter of all the water it supplies. For the whole of England and Wales, the daily loss – from leaks and other losses – from all of the two nations’ main water companies is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/31/drought-water-queues-uk-hosepipe-ban-compulsory-metering\" title=\"\">3bn litres of water</a>, a fifth of their total supply.</p> <p>Such staggering profligacy looks inexcusable, particularly at a time when we are experiencing empty reservoirs, hosepipe bans and visions of scorched gardens, parks and playing fields. Even worse, analyses indicate that, while water bills in England have risen noticeably over the past three decades, spending on improved infrastructure by water companies has, at best, flatlined or declined, depending on how you break down the figures. Hence the intensity of our current drought, it is argued.</p> <p>At the same time, huge dividends have been paid out to water company shareholders while their chief executives have been generously rewarded for their work. Sarah Bentley, head of Thames Water, has a basic salary of £750,000 and has also received hefty annual bonuses. Other CEOs of water companies have been rewarded with similar largesse, with one recent analysis indicating that chief executives of England’s water companies earned a total of £34m over the past two years. Yet these individuals do little more than act as senior civil servants, critics argue.</p> <p>These company chiefs have been the main beneficiaries of the privatisation of England’s water companies, which was imposed by the Conservative government in 1989. The move was hailed by Margaret Thatcher and her ministers as one that would ensure soaring investment in the industry while bringing down consumer prices. In fact, the opposite has occurred. At the same time, a national resource has ended up in the ownership of foreign investors. Hefty chunks of Thames Water have been bought by Chinese, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait finance groups, for example.</p> <p>Such investments are unlikely to have been made for charitable reasons, it should be noted. They will have been made because the dividends looked lucrative to investors. Thus, something that should be treated as a national resource and a core defence against climate change has been sold off for short-term financial gain.</p> <p>This is not the way to invest in infrastructure or prepare defences against the vicissitudes of climate change. The lessons to be learned from our response to the drought run deep. We are not only ill-prepared in terms of pipelines, reservoirs and leak prevention. We are also financially and politically misplaced in our attitudes to climate crises that will assuredly worsen in coming years.</p> <p>• This article, including the headline, was amended on 14 August 2022 to clarify that while it was referring to the UK climate in general, the focus was on England’s water industry in particular.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/why-surprise-when-wealthy-capitalist-makes-large-donation-to-oxford-college","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Why the surprise when a wealthy capitalist makes a large donation to an Oxford college? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/why-surprise-when-wealthy-capitalist-makes-large-donation-to-oxford-college","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/why-surprise-when-wealthy-capitalist-makes-large-donation-to-oxford-college","fields":{"headline":"Letters: why the surprise when a wealthy capitalist makes a large donation to an Oxford college?","trailText":"Elite universities regularly receive multimillion-pound gifts, so why single out Linacre College and the boss of Vietjet?","body":"<p>Why is Catherine Bennett so outraged by Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao’s donation to Oxford (“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/07/oxford-college-link-itself-bikini-airline-now-thats-what-i-call-classy\" title=\"\">An Oxford college is about to link itself to a bikini airline.

However, universities now fear that unexpectedly low results in the Scottish Highers, which pupils received last Tuesday, are likely to be replicated in England on Thursday morning. The overall pass rate for Highers fell from 89.3% in 2020 to 78.9% this summer.</p> <p>Andrew Hargreaves, a former director at admissions service Ucas, and co-founder of dataHE, a consultancy that advises universities on admissions, told the <em>Observer</em>: “There are frantic discussions going on about this in universities. Many fear we might have another year akin to 2020 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/14/gavin-williamson-under-pressure-to-resign-over-a-level-results-fiasco\" title=\"\">all the headlines were about the A-level fiasco</a>.”</p> <p>After schools closed as a result of the pandemic in March 2020, and students were unable to sit exams, the exams regulator drew up a controversial standardisation algorithm to award A-level grades. This led to nearly 40% of predicted grades being downgraded and many students, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/13/england-a-level-downgrades-hit-pupils-from-disadvantaged-areas-hardest\" title=\"\">especially those from poorer backgrounds, losing university places</a>. Students and parents reacted with fury and the government was forced into a humiliating U-turn back to teacher-assessed grades.</p> <p>Although A-levels in England and Wales are overseen by different independent regulators, and a spokesperson for the Department for Education said that it would be “incorrect to use Scottish results as a basis for speculation”, Hargreaves said the Scottish results could be a good indicator of what is coming. He added: “It is a much more dramatic swing than expected and it is certainly not a midpoint.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2152ba53a7f396d704a051b3b3610be535134d11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2152ba53a7f396d704a051b3b3610be535134d11/0_190_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The UCAS website shot in a coffee shop environment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Competition for places is expected to be exceptionally fierce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M4OS Photos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Competition for places at the most selective universities has been exceptionally fierce this year, with institutions cutting back on the number of offers made after being forced to take more students than they wanted during the pandemic, and a demographic surge in the number of 18-year-olds.</p> <p>In recent years, before the pandemic, strong candidates who slipped a grade stood a good chance of talking their way into a leading institution on the phone, but experts say now that is much less likely, especially in popular subjects. Hargreaves urged students waiting for results to start researching a plan B just in case, while Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at Exeter University, warned that Thursday’s results could be disastrous for social mobility. He said selective universities may be unable to “take a chance” on many promising disadvantaged candidates because their grades turn out to be too low. “The real fear is that many disadvantaged students, whose learning was disproportionately damaged by the pandemic, will be elbowed out,” he added. “This year will be the hardest admissions round in living memory for many applicants.”</p> <p>Victoria Panni from Hampshire, whose son Taylor is hoping to study sociology at Bournemouth University, said: “I saw that Scottish students weren’t getting their predicted grades and I’ve been talking to my son about backup plans. It is a very worrying time.”</p> <p>She said: “It seems the government and examining boards totally ignored the fact that for the first year of A-levels the pupils had two lockdowns to endure and most of their learning was alone online.”</p> <p>Mark Garratt, director of marketing, communications and recruitment at Anglia Ruskin University, said students may not realise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-clearing/2022/jul/18/worried-your-a-level-results-might-not-go-to-plan-check-out-our-step-by-step-guide-to-clearing\" title=\"\">clearing is already open</a> and they can contact universities now to see if they have places available in the subjects they want. “There are still going to be plenty of places at universities across the country,” he said. “Preparing in advance can mitigate the stress when students receive their results.”</p> <p>The DfE said: “The pattern of grades in each subject in England will be based around a midpoint between the proportion of each grade in that subject in 2021 and 2019. This is not the same policy employed in Scotland.

But now they’re just pushing it higher and higher, and exploiting people.”</p> \n<p>Around 100 Amazon staff at Bristol staged a sit-in at the company canteen on 10 August – action for which they say they were docked pay by management at the site. “The vast majority of people went back to work at that point, because at the end of the day, as much as they want to fight for it, they have to think about themselves financially.”</p> \n<p>The Bristol warehouse worker says that managers used to stop employees from lifting heavy items from bins on high shelves in the warehouse without a ladder. “If you overstretched yourself for 10 hours, you’d end up with a bad neck and a bad back,” he said.</p> \n<p>That has subsequently changed as staff said they felt pressured to meet ever-escalating demand. Staff pushing carts around the warehouse used to be limited to using one cart at a time for safety reasons; now it is claimed managers turn a blind eye to staff pulling two carts at once. “They don’t say nothing because all they care about is getting the work done as fast as possible,” he said. “Safety just goes out the window.”</p> \n<p>He says he has personally lifted items weighing up to 25kg by himself, despite rules saying anything heavier than 15kg should be lifted by two people.</p> \n<p>A worker at an Amazon facility in the north-west of England<em> </em>said that managers at his warehouse similarly ignored rules around not running on site and lifting down heavy items from high areas in an attempt to meet targets, which at his site require two items to be picked every minute.</p> \n<p>Amazon declined to respond to specific claims.</p> \n<p>Martha Dark, director at Foxglove, a non-profit organisation working to highlight issues within tech companies that supports Amazon workers, said: “None of the workers we’re supporting wanted to protest.</p> \n<p>“They’re desperate and can’t survive on these wages. Meanwhile, Amazon threatens to dock pay and send workers to HR for revealing the truth about life in the warehouse.”</p> \n<p>She added: “Amazon needs to respect workers’ rights to organise, stop penalising people who are fighting to survive and provide a real pay rise now.”</p> \n<p>Two workers said they plan to leave the company because of the conditions and pay. However, some hope to stay put – to change things.</p> \n<p>“If a lot of us who are experienced leave Amazon at this point they’ll get a new group of people in who they can mould into this depressing way of work,” said the Bristol worker. “That’s the problem.”</p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 14 August 2022.

The mob invaded Congress. Trump sat back and watched.</p> <p>Kushner has not fared well either. In testimony to the panel, he has derided Pat Cipollone as a “whiner” and described deigning to exit the shower to take a call from a panicked McCarthy. On the screen, Kushner drips hauteur, empathy nonexistent. It’s not a good look.</p> <p>Then comes Breaking History, Kushner’s White House memoir. It sits at the intersection of spin, absolution and self-aggrandizement.</p> <p>“What is clear to me is that no one at the White House expected violence that day,” Kushner writes of January 6. Cassidy Hutchinson says otherwise.</p> <p>Kushner adds: “I’m confident that if my colleagues or the president had anticipated violence, they would have prevented it from happening.” DC police <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/politics/trump-secret-service-january-6-metropolitan-police-officer/index.html\">tell a different story</a>.</p> <p>Kushner <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kushner-blamed-middle-east-for-why-he-didnt-challenge-trump-after-election-book-2021-11\">rebuffed</a> early entreaties from Marc Short, the vice-president’s chief of staff, to end Trump’s attempt to stop certification of Joe Biden’s win.</p> <p>“You know, I’m really focused on the Middle East right now,” Kushner replied. “I haven’t really been involved in the election stuff since Rudy Giuliani came in.”</p> <p>In the aftermath of January 6, White House morale was at a nadir, according to Kushner. A second impeachment loomed. Kushner told staff to stay the course.</p> <p>“You took an oath to the country,” he recalls. “This is a moment when we have to do what’s right, not what’s popular. If the country is better off with you here, then stay. If it doesn’t matter, then do what you want.”</p> <p>That sales pitch sounds canned. Those who had served in the military found the spiel stale and grating.</p> <p>In Kushner, Inc, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/24/kushner-inc-review-vicky-ward-jared-ivanka-trump-kakistocracy\">the author Vicky Ward</a> described Kushner’s earlier efforts to persuade Mark Corallo to join the White House staff. Corallo was once in the army and did a stint at the Department of Justice too.</p> <p>After he said no, Kushner asked: “Don’t you want to serve your country?”</p> <p>Corallo replied: “Young man, my three years at the butt end of an M-16 checked that box.”</p> <p>Trump dodged the draft for Vietnam. When his brother, Fred Jr, accepted a commission in the air national guard, he met with his family’s scorn. In contrast, Mike Pence’s son, the Biden boys, Steve Bannon: all wore a uniform.</p> <p>In Breaking History, Kushner selectively parcels out dirt. He seeks to absolve his father for recruiting a sex worker to film her tryst with William Schulder, Charlie Kushner’s brother-in-law. At the time, Schulder, his wife, Esther, (Charlie’s sister), and Charlie were locked in battle over control of the family real estate business.</p> <p>Kushner explains: “Billy’s infidelity was an open secret around the office, and to show his sister Esther what kind of man she had married, my father hired a prostitute who seduced Billy.”</p> <p>Schulder and Esther were also talking to the feds.</p> <p>The names of two Trump paramours, Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, and Karen McDougal, the Playboy model, do not appear in Kushner’s book. Then again, as Trump once said, “When you’re a star … you can do anything.” For Trump and Kushner, rules are meant for others.</p> <p>Breaking History comes with conflicting creation stories. In June, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/us/politics/jared-kushner-trump-jan-6.html\">the New York Times</a> reported that Kushner took an online MasterClass from the thriller writer James Patterson, then “batted out” 40,000 words of his own.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/08/jared-kushner-james-patterson-trump-election-the-divider-book\">The Guardian reported</a> that Kushner received assistance from Ken Kurson, a former editor of the New York Observer who was pardoned by Trump on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/jared-kushner-friend-ken-kurson-charged-with-stalking.html\">cyberstalking</a> charges but then <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/ken-kurson-friend-of-trump-aide-jared-kushner-guilty-in-stalking-case-.html\">pleaded guilty</a> after being charged with spying on his wife. Avi Berkowitz, a Kushner deputy who worked on the Abraham Accords, and Cassidy Luna, an aide married to Nick Luna, Trump’s White House “body man”, were also on board.</p> <p>Breaking History says nothing about Patterson but gives shout-outs to Kurson, Luna and Berkowitz: “From the inception of this endeavor, Ken’s brutally honest feedback and inventive suggestions have made this a better book.”</p> <p>Kushner rightly takes pride in the Abraham Accords, normalization agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. In the process, he provides backstory for Trump’s frustration with Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66f885a6444aa44fda7782808fb5a91adf1c4cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66f885a6444aa44fda7782808fb5a91adf1c4cf0/0_121_5769_3461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Kurson, right, and Jared Kushner attend the New York Observer’s 25th anniversary party, in New York in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Kurson, right, and Jared Kushner attend the New York Observer’s 25th anniversary party, in New York in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Israel’s then-prime minister’s earned a “fuck him” after he hesitatingly embraced Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, seeking to garner maximum concession without grace or reciprocity.

I have to deal with the fallout of this. You don’t.”</p> <p>One Trump veteran described Breaking History to the Guardian as “just 493 pages of pure boredom”. Not exactly. Kushner delivers a mixture of news and cringe. He does not extract Trump from his present morass. On Wednesday, Kushner’s father-in-law invoked the fifth amendment.

But avoiding that short-term pain has a long-term impact, I think, badly undermining confidence in the department.”</p> <p>Ken Butler, a policy adviser at Disability Rights UK, said: “We’re not talking about just one report and one subject. We’re talking about a whole swathe of reports about important aspects of the system. The DWP are operating behind a wall of secrecy.”</p> <p>Coffey laid out her refusal to publish the information in<a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/23182/documents/169468/default/\" title=\"\"> a letter to the select committee</a>. The reports are as follows. First, an evaluation of the reduction in the benefit cap, which has been at the same rate since 2016 and ranges from £13,400 for individuals outside London to £23,000 for families in the capital. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/14/one-in-12-uk-children-now-in-families-hit-by-two-child-benefit-limit\" title=\"\">About 1.3 million children in the cap</a> have parents who struggle to buy basics such as food and nappies.</p> <p>Second, monthly reports on how accessible the Department for Work and Pensions websites and apps are. These are used for claiming and receiving benefits – accessibility is a major issue for some disabled people.</p> <p>Third, internal reports on the deaths of benefit claimants. The DWP has started 140 internal process reviews since July 2019 into claimants whose deaths may be linked to benefits. In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/28/disabled-man-starved-to-death-after-dwp-stopped-his-benefits\" title=\"\">Errol Graham</a> died of starvation after benefits were cut off.</p> <p>Fourth, cabinet office research into the effectiveness of support for vulnerable claimants of universal credit. Charities are concerned that people moving on to UC from other forms of benefit such as disability benefits may lose out.</p> <p>Fifth, a DWP report evaluating the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/report-on-effectiveness-of-benefit-sanctions-blocked-by-dwp\" title=\"\"> impact of benefit sanctions</a> in persuading people into work. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/22/benefit-sanctions-found-to-be-ineffective-and-damaging\" title=\"\">Academic research</a> suggests that sanctions only make people ill and has been described as a “war on families”.</p> <p>Coffey added that the DWP had not decided if it would publish “Experiences of claiming and receiving Carer’s Allowance”, which examines how and why unpaid carers face extra hurdles in getting jobs.</p> <p>Coffey said she was “not committing” to publishing statistics on work capability assessments for UC, which are used to establish if ill or disabled people can work. Statistics on previous benefits such as personal independence payments are published: about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/06/five-month-disability-benefits-delay-causing-hardship-says-citizens-advice\" title=\"\">327,000 people are missing out on payments</a> due to delays of up to five months.</p> <p>“We’re being told this isn’t a priority at the moment and basically being dismissed,” Butler said. “When you’re moving two million disabled people on to a new benefit all these issues are really relevant.</p> <p>“Even the DWP has acknowledged that disabled people have a lack of trust in the DWP. Although they say they want to improve trust and improve transparency, they are actually not publishing information that’s open to scrutiny and that is deeply concerning.”</p> <p>In January, the select committee took the unusual step of writing to NatCen Social Research, Britain’s largest independent social researcher, using parliamentary powers to order it to provide a copy of a report commissioned by the DWP into disability benefits.</p> <p>The report “gave rise to some potentially awkward questions for ministers to have to answer, although, frankly, if you read the report, they were pretty mild”, Timms said.</p> <p>“But it was inconvenient. So they decided they were going to avoid scrutiny and not publish it. But since then, we’ve become aware of a whole range of other reports, which either had previously been promised to be published, or clearly ought to be published.”</p> <p>The DWP did not comment, although it referred to a passage in Coffey’s letter where she states: “We have been clear that where requests relate to research that is informing ongoing policy development, the department reserves the right to withhold it. It is important that ministers consider research and its publication on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>“I do understand the close interest of the committee in research that informs policy, but it is not the case that we committed to publish all research commissioned by a secretary of state, including research commissioned by my predecessors.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/13/body-recovered-from-south-yorkshire-lake-after-reports-of-man-in-difficulty","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T21:31:49Z","webTitle":"Body recovered from South Yorkshire lake after reports of man in difficulty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/13/body-recovered-from-south-yorkshire-lake-after-reports-of-man-in-difficulty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/13/body-recovered-from-south-yorkshire-lake-after-reports-of-man-in-difficulty","fields":{"headline":"Body recovered from South Yorkshire lake after reports of man in difficulty","trailText":"Emergency services search scene after man in 20s said to have been in stretch of water in Lakeside, Doncaster","byline":"Nadeem Badshah","body":"<p>A body has been found in a lake in South Yorkshire after emergency services responded to reports that a man had got into difficulty, police have said.</p> <p>Emergency services were contacted at about 4.30pm about the man, aged in his 20s, being in the stretch of water in Lakeside, Doncaster.</p> <p>About 9pm, South Yorkshire police said that a body had been discovered after their search. </p> <p>The force said: “We are very sorry to report that following earlier information about an incident at Lakeside, Doncaster, a body has now been found.</p> <p>“Emergency services responded to the lake at around 4.10pm today, after receiving calls that a man, aged in the 20s, had got into difficulty in the water.

Tottenham had trained for two hours and then, cajoled by the fitness coach, Gian Piero Ventrone, were told to run 42 lengths of the World Cup Stadium pitch. Anyone whose June had been eaten into by international duty was let off with a mere 30; Ryan Sessegnon was not among those blessed with such fortune.</p> <p>“I knew it was going to be tough but it was worse than I thought,” he says in reference to the blistering intensity demanded during Spurs’ preparations. “Those 42 runs in Korea, the amount of running, it was crazy. I wasn’t being sick like a few of the players were, but I was on my knees.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/12/feeling-of-flux-means-harry-kane-and-son-can-change-spurs-narrative-against-chelsea\">Tottenham’s attacking quartet look to secure the edge over Chelsea | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps it worked because Sessegnon has begun the season standing tall. His first Premier League goal for Tottenham also opened the club’s account for 2022-23 and offset what had been a sticky start against Southampton. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/06/tottenham-southampton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">They won at a canter</a> from there and their left wing-back was relentless: Sessegnon looked every inch a wide all-rounder from Conte’s model and could feel the summer regimen paying off.</p> <p>“Definitely [fitness] makes a difference,” he says. “When I’m on the pitch and feel like I’m in my stride and have the energy to go up and down, you almost feel unstoppable. You feel like you can go past anyone, do anything on the pitch, you really feel yourself.”</p> <p>There is, famously, no hiding place for a wing-back under Conte. “It’s probably one of the hardest positions in the team at the moment,” Sessegnon says. “He wants you to contribute going forward but defensively as well, so you have to have that engine to go up and down. That’s one of my strong suits but it can always be improved.”</p> <p>Perhaps the moment when Sessegnon ran off Kyle Walker-Peters and planted a stooping far-post header past Gavin Bazunu will go down as an arrival. It would not be before time: he was limited to 21 top-flight outings in his first three seasons after joining from Fulham, albeit one of those campaigns was largely spent on loan at Hoffenheim, and his roar on to the scene as a 16-year-old was in danger of becoming a receding memory.</p> <p>A year after that, in 2017-18, he was scoring 15 goals in the Championship. But it was only in May that he turned 22 and, after a succession of minor injuries stalled him last time around, there is the sense a corner may have been turned.</p> <p>“It helps,” he says of breaking his duck. “At the back end of last season I had a little run in the team and I felt part of the team. To start the first game of the season was very good for me and to add my goal to help the team win was great.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7b1d1f5a4c14823de7111ab1aa8101f340823bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b1d1f5a4c14823de7111ab1aa8101f340823bc/0_231_7664_4600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Sessegnon, pictured at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with some of the youngsters who attended Summer of Spurs, a free activity programme being delivered by the Club throughout August to keep local young people engaged during the school holidays.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Sessegnon, pictured at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with some of the youngsters who are attending “Summer of Spurs”, a free activity programme being delivered by the club throughout August to keep local young people engaged during the school holidays.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sessegnon has always had the right tools: speed, trickery, an end product, a turbo-powered engine. They have not always been enough to give him a chance and perhaps he felt a sense of deja vu when Ivan Perisic, a Champions League winner and World Cup finalist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/28/ivan-perisic-accepts-spurs-offer-sign-inter-antonio-conte\" title=\"\">arrived from Internazionale</a> in June. Perisic can play in several positions but would surely have started in Sessegnon’s place had his pre-season activity not been limited by a calf injury.</p> <p>“I had a different attitude,” Sessegnon says, rejecting the idea that such high-level competition for his place was dispiriting. “I never saw the situation like that. I saw it as a chance for me to improve and get help from him.”</p> <p>That is what happened last Saturday when Perisic, who replaced Sessegnon in the 66th minute, advised his younger teammate to exploit Walker-Peters’s lack of height and make the run that brought his goal. “That feeling of arriving in the box at just the right time is a priceless feeling,” he says.</p> <p>More of the same would help reduce the burden on Harry Kane and Spurs’ other forwards and there is little doubt he has it in him. Sessegnon was a striker before the coaches at Fulham realised his running power was too good to waste and those instincts have never quite been blunted.</p> <p>“If you saw the goals I scored at Fulham a lot of them were in and around the box, rebounds, little short finishes. So it helped from when I was younger. I want to get back to doing those kinds of things, following things in, so I can help the team.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be807d3153c7887216d18bb964a67d4966d52ca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be807d3153c7887216d18bb964a67d4966d52ca2/0_0_3000_2222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Sessegnon challenges Kyle Walker-Peters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sessegnon knows he needs to have the engine to compete both in an attacking and defensive role for Spurs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harriet Lander/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Chelsea will be next to observe Sessegnon’s refined nose for goal. A meeting of London rivals already has added spice – “Coming through at Fulham it’s in your brain to dislike Chelsea so this game is extra-special for me” – when thoughts turn to the likely identity of his direct opponent.</p> <p>Reece James is five months older than Sessegnon and the pair are friends, first pitched against one another at age-group levels from under-nine upwards and becoming colleagues in the England squad that won the Uefa Under-19 Championship in 2017.</p> <p>“You have to say he’s come out on top,” he says of those academy meetings, when Chelsea’s youngsters would often run riot. “I think I know his weaknesses as well but I won’t say too much now. He’s a great player, what he’s done for Chelsea and England has been very good, so you can always look at that and it inspires you.”</p> <p>A meeting as equals at Stamford Bridge could constitute a minor career landmark; further evidence, perhaps, that Sessegnon can make up ground lost on his old rival in the long-term. The battle to keep his place will be formidable: there was a reason for the acquisition of Perisic and, besides, rotation will be necessary even if he manages to see the veteran off. For now, Sessegnon hopes those yards in the legs keep making the difference.</p> <p>“There are always going to be times when you’re a bit tired, especially early in the season,” he says. “But it’s about the timing of when to arrive and when to get back in. Nobody is superhuman but you can try to be as close as possible to it.”</p> <p>Whether in the heat of Asia or a sweltering English summer that has little precedent, Conte would expect nothing less.</p> <p><em>Ryan Sessegnon was speaking at the Summer of Spurs – a free activity programme by the club to keep local young people engaged during the school holidays, promoting health and wellbeing and reducing levels of crime and antisocial behaviour</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/13/jerry-sadowitz-edinburgh-fringe-standup-show-axed-due-to-complaints","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T21:16:26Z","webTitle":"Jerry Sadowitz Edinburgh fringe standup show axed due to complaints","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/13/jerry-sadowitz-edinburgh-fringe-standup-show-axed-due-to-complaints","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/13/jerry-sadowitz-edinburgh-fringe-standup-show-axed-due-to-complaints","fields":{"headline":"Jerry Sadowitz Edinburgh fringe standup show axed due to complaints","trailText":"Pleasance theatre cancels Scottish comic, saying his material ‘does not align with our values’","byline":"Gareth Rubin","body":"<p>The Scottish comedian Jerry Sadowitz has had his Edinburgh fringe show cancelled by the venue after complaints from staff and audience members.</p> <p>Sadowitz played just one night, on Friday, before the Pleasance banned him from performing again.

But in 2021 there were just 56, and so far this year there have been 84, according to the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (Biaza).</p> <p>Nicky Needham, Biaza’s senior manager for animal care and conservation, said there were more than 400 European Endangered Species Programmes (EEPs), and UK zoos and aquariums were involved in coordinating about 25%.</p> <p>“These are safety net populations for threatened species,” she said. “Animal transfers between zoos and aquariums are carefully planned to maintain a healthy genetic population.”</p> <p>One programme to save the Eastern black rhinoceros, a critically endangered species, has 87 animals, of which about 39 are at UK zoos. “Losing this would jeopardise the viability of the population and stop reintroductions to east Africa,” Needham said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"780b5e2fae093b05072cbc56785e5a889cd0d4d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/780b5e2fae093b05072cbc56785e5a889cd0d4d6/0_110_2182_1309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Twin golden lion tamarins, which were born at Bristol Zoo Gardens, cling to their parents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twin golden lion tamarins, which were born at Bristol Zoo Gardens, cling to their parents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Transfers have plunged for two main reasons, Needham said. Since Brexit, a new EU Animal Health Regulation has come into force, after being agreed in 2016. That created new controls on the import of animals and plants into the EU, known as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks.</p> <p>Many of those checks need to be carried out at border control posts, which are usually set up by private enterprises. A few exist at airports in the EU, but so far there are none at French ports, creating an effective ban on the import of any large animal.</p> <p>Last week the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/06/british-farmers-face-paying-for-border-checkpoints-in-eu-after-brexit-halts-exports\" title=\"\">Observer </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/06/british-farmers-face-paying-for-border-checkpoints-in-eu-after-brexit-halts-exports\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that farmers were considering taking the extraordinary step of building a border control post in Calais and paying for it themselves, so that breeders could export their pedigree cattle, sheep and pigs.</p> <p>The few animals that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2017/apr/09/how-to-move-an-elephant-to-europe-post-brexit\" title=\"\">transferred successfully</a> to European zoos have travelled in aeroplanes. One was Sammi, a margay or tiger cat, born at Shaldon Wildlife Trust in Devon in late 2020. Margays are native to central and south America, but illegal hunting mean they are now classified as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d6501039fe48681864e4ab927db169ccccc5623f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6501039fe48681864e4ab927db169ccccc5623f/0_0_2408_3500/688.jpg\" alt=\"A Sumatran tiger named Dash was recruited by Chester Zoo from Fota Wildlife Park in Ireland to help protect his critically endangered species.\" width=\"688\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Sumatran tiger named Dash was recruited by Chester Zoo from Fota Wildlife Park in Ireland to help protect his critically endangered species.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chester Zoo/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are 45 in Europe, with only six breeding pairs, so after the age of 10 months, when margays leave their mothers, Sammi was scheduled to go to Berlin Zoo to pair with a female margay from France.</p> <p>“Prior to Brexit this would not have been a problem,” said Zak Showell, Shaldon Wildlife Trust’s chief executive. “It would have taken a month or two to organise for the animal to get collected by a specialist transport company. This took six months.</p> <p>“When we’re dealing with small populations, being able to move animals to set up new breeding pairs is incredibly important. Certain animals like the black rhino, if you don’t breed them then they stop cycling. Having individuals on their own or not in breeding situations hampers the ability to continue breeding these endangered species.”</p> <p>Some zoos have not been so lucky, with transfers falling through or facing very long delays. Ramon the orangutan arrived in Munster in June 2022 from Blackpool Zoo, after a year of planning. His departure means Blackpool’s zookeepers can import another male to join the group and hope for more baby orangutans.Showell had to apply for separate animal health certificates for Sammi the margay.</p> <p>“Every time an animal is moved, Defra has to negotiate with the other country on what level of health screening and surveillance and everything else needs to be done for this animal to move,” he said.</p> <p>Some countries want new certificates for each species, Showell added. “I’ve just been told I need to move some tamarins [New World monkeys] to Belgium. The health certificate for primates from the UK to Belgium does not exist. It’s made the whole process incredibly complicated and so much more time-intensive.”</p> <p>Costs have also increased, because specialist transport companies are not able to drive their vehicles in Europe without approval. “We’re moving more animals via planes, which is more expensive. And we’re talking small animals here. You can’t fit a giraffe on a plane.”</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>“This shows the real harm the bureaucratic approach the EU has chosen to take on animal and plant health. We’re ready to continue to negotiate on this where sensible pragmatic compromises can lead to improvements for everyone.</p> <p>“Meanwhile we are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency and the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums to identify priority exports where there are welfare concerns or implications to breeding programs.</p> <p>“All of the requests for export health certificates for the exports of zoo animals have been successfully fast tracked.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/13/erik-ten-hag-the-manchester-united-team-has-to-take-responsibility","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T20:38:27Z","webTitle":"Erik ten Hag says Manchester United players put tactical plan ‘in the bin’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/erik-ten-hag-the-manchester-united-team-has-to-take-responsibility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/13/erik-ten-hag-the-manchester-united-team-has-to-take-responsibility","fields":{"headline":"Erik ten Hag says Manchester United players put tactical plan ‘in the bin’","trailText":"Erik ten Hag said his Manchester United team had to take responsibility after they were thrashed 4-0 at Brentford","byline":"John Brewin at Brentford Community Stadium","body":"<p>Erik ten Hag blamed “individual mistakes” and admitted Brentford were far hungrier as his Manchester United team crashed to a second consecutive defeat at the start of the Premier League season.</p> \n<p>Brentford racked up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">four first-half goals</a> in a disastrous opening 35 minutes for United, an error from David de Gea for Josh Dasilva’s opener setting the tone and Ten Hag said: “Brentford were more hungry. We conceded goals from individual mistakes. You can’t have a tactical plan but then put it in the bin.”</p> \n<p>Two competitive matches into his new job, the Dutchman was forced to apologise to the club’s travelling fans. “It is difficult for me,” he said. “It is always a surprise when you start a game like this. After 35 minutes we conceded four goals. This is not possible. The team has to take the responsibility, I feel really sorry for the fans who did everything to support us, we let them down.”</p> \n<p>With Brentford repeatedly catching out United’s tactic of playing the ball out from defence, Dasilva’s and Mattias Jensen’s goals both came following mistakes in possession. Ten Hag still defended his prescribed system. “I’m convinced he can do it,” he said of De Gea. “I’ve seen it in training. “They [all] can. We saw it in pre‑season.”</p> \n<p>He was still highly critical of his team’s performance. “They are good players, and have to take responsibility on the pitch, as a team and as individuals, and that’s what we didn’t do. I asked them to play with belief and take responsibility for their performance, and that’s what they didn’t do.</p> \n<p>“It’s only when we stick together and work hard that we will overcome that. You have to take belief on to the pitch for yourself and the team.</p> \n<p>“Don’t get me wrong, the manager is responsible as well, he has the main responsibility, and I take that.

After the mistake and the second, it was very tough for the team. It was a horrible day. Of course we should react better, but I should have saved the first shot, and probably the result would be different.”</p> \n<p>The Spaniard said United’s players needed to offer far more to give Ten Hag chance to succeed at Old Trafford. “It’s easy to play pre-season, you play for nothing, but when you play games that matter you need bravery, to be more consistent, and be proper players. Head up, and stick together as a team. We have a lot to learn from a new manager.”</p> \n<p>The Brentford manager, Thomas Frank, while saying it “should never be routine” beating Manchester United, said: “It is amazing how this group of players keep giving me and the fans memories for life. It is crazy.

They’re still being seen everywhere from the street to Fashion Week runways. It’s all about choice now – what is comfortable and what suits your personal style – rather than smooshing yourself into one common trend. It’s a push towards democratising fashion. Our own friends are just as much personal trendsetters as celebrities, since platforms like Instagram gave us all a space to develop our own aesthetic portfolios.</p> <p>This has created a generational view of fashion that is much more inclusive and less cut-throat. I can’t really think of many trends that are actually “out” – other than fur and, increasingly, hopefully, fast fashion. It’s also less fixed. We’re donning a different look every day – or even multiple looks mashed up at once – rather than committing to one for a period of our lives.</p> <p>The so-called “nostalgia” trend can also be understood in the broader context of Gen Z’s love of mimicry and intertextual references. Take the popularity of memes and, more recently, TikTok. It’s all about recreating your own version of something. Then your own version of a version of something. The references are often so many layers deep that I’m not surprised those not up-to-the-minute with digital culture are mistaking their mockery for homage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/07/as-our-son-flies-away-are-my-tears-for-him-or-for-our-own-leaving-behind-of-youth\">As our son flies away, are my tears for him? Or for our own leaving behind of youth? | Anna Sublet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, the nostalgia narrative seems to leave out the fact that plenty of trends being reanimated for the 2020s are actually common sense given the moment we’re in. We’re wearing 2000s get-up because we want to be sustainable by op-shopping (and apparently a lot of low-rise jeans were up for resell). We’re using flip phones because we’re trying to be more mindful of our technology use. We’re buying records because more money goes to the artists rather than, say, Spotify. And mullets are back and in the mainstream, not because we all wish we lived in the 80s, but because we’re generally shifting as a society towards more genderless style. </p> <p>So to older generations who coo that we must be nostalgic for a pre-pandemic, pre-climate change, pre-housing crisis world (themselves indulging in pity porn while doing nothing to actually absolve the crises they’ve bequeathed to us) I respond: the kids are alright. On balance, I feel lucky about the age I’ve grown up in. I honestly couldn’t imagine anything worse than coming of age at a time when heroin chic was all the rage and women on screen were lucky if they had a name let alone a personality. Far from a practice in escapism, our interest in the past is much more about the lessons that can be gleaned from it – both the good and the bad – as well as perhaps a more morbid recognition of the things that have not progressed as much as they should have.</p> <p>Let’s save our condescension for those who talk earnestly about “the good old days”. More often than not, these are the kinds of people who are <em>genuinely</em> nostalgic for eras where men were macho, women subservient and milk tasted like real milk.</p> <p>• Bridget McArthur is a freelance writer and host of the 3CR program Chronically Chilled</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/14/why-is-the-reserve-bank-of-australia-exploring-digital-currency-options","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T20:00:51Z","webTitle":"Why is the Reserve Bank of Australia exploring digital currency options?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/14/why-is-the-reserve-bank-of-australia-exploring-digital-currency-options","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/14/why-is-the-reserve-bank-of-australia-exploring-digital-currency-options","fields":{"headline":"Why is the Reserve Bank of Australia exploring digital currency options?","trailText":"The RBA is looking into the idea of a central bank digital currency as cryptocurrencies continue to gain popularity","byline":"Peter Hannam","body":"<p>Last week the Reserve Bank of Australia announced <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2022/mr-22-23.html\">a year-long research project</a> with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre to explore “use cases” for a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Here is what’s going on.</p> \n<h2>What is a CBDC and how is it different from cryptocurrency?</h2> \n<p>Banknotes are a physical form of money we exchange for goods and services. And we’re increasingly making digital transactions, whether tapping credit cards or smartphones. ATM use is down about a third in three years, <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2021/sp-gov-2021-12-09.html\">the RBA says</a>.</p> \n<p>Now, the RBA and counterparts around the world are studying new digital forms of money that central banks themselves might issue.

Bitcoin and ethereum are among prominent digital currencies relying on cryptography to secure transactions.</p> \n<p>To curb price volatility of cryptos, stablecoins have been created to mimic “fiat currencies” by anchoring value to assets such as the US dollar. The failure of <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/the-fall-of-terra-a-timeline-of-the-meteoric-rise-and-crash-of-ust-and-luna/\">TerraUSD</a> and other stablecoins reflects the sector’s infancy. CBDCs might fill the gap.</p> \n<p>“A fully realised central bank digital currency has the promise to bring the regulatory certainty and power of digital assets to a place that’s coupled with the trust and faith that we have in money that’s issued by the Reserve Bank today,” said Michael Bacina, a partner at Piper Alderman and a fintech specialist.</p> \n<h2>Why is the RBA getting involved?</h2> \n<p>Partly exploratory. “I don’t think it’s inevitable” that the bank will issue CBDCs, says the RBA deputy governor, Michele Bullock.</p> \n<p>“In terms of day-to-day payments that touch you and [me] and our friends and family, it’s not clear to us what the case for it is,” she says. “We have banknotes. We have lots and lots of digital money alternatives [including] fast payments now.</p> \n<p>“I think we just need to keep our toes in it, and not be at the bleeding forefront.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Australia Weekend signup\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The focus will be less on the technology itself but rather settling on design principles of how decentralised such currencies might be, while maintaining standards of protecting privacy that the public can accept.</p> \n<p>“Do you put limits on the amount of money people can have in this?

It stipulates that no new liquor licences can be issued for venues after 1am, barring an exemption.</p> <p>“If you’re running a nightclub, having a license until 1am is not really going to work,” says Daragh Kan, the former owner of the Mercat, an iconic CBD nightclub which closed in 2017.</p> <p>Kan says venues in prime inner-city locations are attractive targets for development. Once a venue is developed, their late-night licence is lost forever. “So if you want to start a new club, you’re reliant on finding another venue with a pre-existing licence,” he says.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.vcglr.vic.gov.au/resources/data-and-research/liquor-data/liquor-licences-category\">data</a> from the regulator, since 2014, the number of active late-night liquor licences in metropolitan Melbourne has decreased by nearly 10%, despite the population growing 13% in that time.</p> <p>“Cities also experience a reputational hit,” Homan adds, citing how Sydney’s lockout laws eroded its credibility as a cultural centre as well as costing it an estimated $16bn in trade. Sydney’s lockout laws were introduced in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/lockout-laws-lifted-for-kings-cross\">fully revoked in early 2021</a>.</p> <p>Successive Victorian governments have cited alcohol-fuelled violence and antisocial behaviour as justification for the freeze.

He says regulatory responses can end up affecting those most at risk of late-night violence: people who found safety and community in subcultural spaces.</p> <p>Since 2015, Victoria has allowed exemptions for live music venues that can satisfy the regulator that the economic and social benefit of granting a licence will outweigh the impact on community amenity and alcohol misuse. But Kan says that’s a very difficult hurdle for independent venue owners to overcome, especially when coupled with the costs that may be required.</p> <p>There are hopes that with the <a href=\"https://creative.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/552832/Creative-State-2025.pdf\">state government</a> and <a href=\"https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/news-and-media/Pages/Lead-role-to-reinvigorate-Melbourne%E2%80%99s-night-time-economy-.aspx\">Melbourne City Council</a> signalling an arts-led recovery from the effects of the pandemic, there may be opportunity for regulatory change.

Patients were in our textbooks and on slides in lectures, but they weren’t included as genuine teachers. For many of my young, smart (and healthy) colleagues illness was the just stuff of textbooks.</p> <p>From time to time, a doctor will get sick and then write about having their view of medicine altered. They find themselves in a hospital bed, maybe in a busy emergency department, alone and confused. And they suddenly feel what their patients feel. Now, they declare, they want to be a different kind of doctor.</p> <p>These experiences are valid, all experiences of illness are valid, but these accounts from doctors miss the core problem.</p> <p>Why are we waiting for doctors to get sick in order to understand sickness?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not everyone needs to get sick to appreciate what it feels like</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In addition to discussing how much better they understand their patients now, and celebrating the extra empathy they now have towards patients, they should be disappointed in the system that taught them.</p> <p>When I read the first-hand epiphanies of doctors I think of their patients. The patients whose illness experience they may have dismissed. The families who waited hours to have a doctor rush in for a few minutes and then leave. The patient who complained about pain, only to have a doctor roll their eyes. </p> <p>Empathy can be taught. It can be cultivated at medical school by including more humanities subjects and creating opportunities for students to share stories. However, the ultimate teachers of empathy are actually right under our noses – patients. Patients aren’t included in medical teaching to the extent they should be. Mostly, patients are passive participants while in hospitals, as senior doctors bounce from bed to bed with a group of students in tow.</p> <p>Patients should be elevated as teachers. They should be invited to lecture and teach students, as important as any professor of medicine. Why aren’t discussion groups led by patients who have major illness run alongside tutorials on anatomy and physiology? This contact with patients can then be reinforced with immersive experiences designed to simulate what patients feel while receiving healthcare. I believe paying attention to the empathic skills of doctors may help protect them from burnout or cope with the feelings they experience when patients don’t do well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c53d2b3510c77b7a2d91b55d6ddf0f2dbeb6058\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c53d2b3510c77b7a2d91b55d6ddf0f2dbeb6058/0_203_2015_1209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Ben Bravery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Ben Bravery, cancer survivor and doctor, has written a memoir about his experience as a patient and physician in Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hachette</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some studies <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15671323/\">have suggested</a> that as they progress through their medical training, future doctors <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21670661/\">become less empathic</a>.

They are good players, and have to take responsibility on the pitch, as a team and as individuals, and that’s what we didn’t do. I asked them to play with belief and take responsibility for their performance, and that’s what they didn’t do. We have to work on that. It’s only when we stick together and work hard that we will overcome that. You have to take belief onto the pitch for yourself and the team. Don’t get me wrong, the manager is responsible as well, he has the main responsibility, and I take that. And I will work on that. I have to give them belief, but they have to give it by themselves.

It is crazy. It is a fully deserved win against Manchester United, who have top players … we were aggressive and brave and pressed hard up the pitch … we were very good on set pieces … we played to our strength with the longer balls … we have not outplayed one of the top-six teams, we had to be pragmatic … it doesn’t always go like this, but today it did … every set piece is a chance.” </p> <p>Did they deliberately target 5ft 9in Lisandro Martinez with long balls? “We knew that more likely we’d win it or the second ball round it.

It was a poor performance from myself. After the mistake and the second, it was very tough for the team. It was a horrible day. Of course we should react better, but I should have saved the first shot, and probably the result would be different. Maybe I have to read the game better and kick it long, maybe I shouldn’t have played to Christian, I should read better today. We are not like teams who concede one goal but then win 5-1, 6-1. This is why I think I cost today three points. It was an easy save, and it was 1-0 for them, and I feel already that it was going down, down and down. Of course we have to react much better. It was a poor performance. It’s easy to play pre-season, you play for nothing, but when you play games that matter you need bravery, to be more consistent, and be proper players. In my case, it wasn’t the case today, and I need to keep working. Head up, and stick together as a team. We have a lot to learn from a new manager.”</p> <p>He’s then asked if he has any idea how United turn this around. After a pause of nearly five seconds, he says “I’m not sure, to be honest … stick together, work hard and learn what the manager wants … let’s play for this badge, for the club, with our lives.”</p> <p>That’s an extraordinary interview.

None of which serves to help the visitors, who really need to get something tonight ahead of next week’s game with Liverpool. However, say what you will about this United team, but they often produced a big result when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer really needed one. Can they provide similar succour for their new boss?

Even more starkly, 68% said they would prefer to still have Johnson than see him replaced by Sunak, who was preferred by just 19%.</p> <p>The poll found that almost three in ten of the Tory electorate (29%) had already voted. Some 47% said they would definitely be voting for the candidate they had opted for. Just 19% said they had yet to make up their mind.</p> <p>Opinium said that while these finding still meant it was possible for Sunak to pull off a stunning comeback and enter No 10, to do so he would have to win over almost all the undecideds and convert a sizeable chunk of Truss waverers.</p> <p>Truss’s support is particularly strong among older Conservative members, while Sunak’s is far higher among younger ones. Among over-65s Truss is 40 points ahead, whereas she is eight points behind Sunak among the under-50s.</p> <p>Opinium asked members what the main single reason was that they backed one of the two candidates. For Sunak the most cited reason was that he would be better at managing the economy (22%), while 10% said they regarded him as the most competent or intelligent.</p> <p>A main reason mentioned by people who backed Truss was dislike of Sunak (14%). The same proportion (14%) said the foreign secretary was more honest and trustworthy, while 10% chose the fact that she had remained loyal to Johnson and not called on him to resign. Some 2% of Tory members cited race or ethnicity as a reason for supporting Truss and not Sunak.</p> <p>Chris Curtis of Opinium said that despite an apparent growing nostalgia among Tory members for Johnson – and a less than ecstatic response to either of the candidates bidding to replace him – it was now hard to see how Truss could fail to become the next prime minister.</p> <p>“From the moment we knew the final two candidates, it has been clear that Truss has had all the momentum, and our latest poll sets out just how large her lead among the party members has become,” he said.</p> <p>“With many members having already returned their ballot papers, it is now very unlikely Truss won’t become prime minister in September.</p> <p>“It’s clear that Sunak’s biggest problem is trust. While some members respect his economic arguments, this hasn’t been enough to overcome the view among members that he isn’t honest or trustworthy enough for the top job, particularly after he called for Johnson to go.”</p> <p>Today’s poll is the first by Opinium taken exclusively among the party members who will ultimately decide the next Prime Minister, since MPs whittled the number of candidates down to two. The final result will be announced on September 5.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/13/70-firefighters-tackle-grass-fire-on-rammey-marsh-north-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T19:02:19Z","webTitle":"70 firefighters tackle grass fire on Rammey Marsh, north London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/13/70-firefighters-tackle-grass-fire-on-rammey-marsh-north-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/13/70-firefighters-tackle-grass-fire-on-rammey-marsh-north-london","fields":{"headline":"70 firefighters tackle grass fire on Rammey Marsh, north London","trailText":"Ten fire engines dispatched to the scene of blaze covering 900m by 600m area of grassland in Enfield","byline":"Nadeem Badshah","body":"<p>About 70 firefighters are tackling a grass fire in north London.</p> <p>An area of grassland measuring about 900m by 600m is alight and 10 fire engines were dispatched to the scene on Rammey Marsh in Enfield after being called at 12.59pm.</p> <p>The London fire brigade (LFB) said the flames were producing a lot of smoke over the M25 between junctions 25 and 26.

His agent, Andrew Wylie, said his liver had been damaged and that he was likely to lose an eye.</p> <p>His alleged attacker, 24-year-old Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder and assault.</p> <p>Rushdie, 75, had been speaking at a literary festival at the Chautauqua Institution in western New York state about the importance of America giving asylum to exiled writers when he was assaulted.</p> <p>Matar, who had bought a ticket, allegedly rushed on stage and stabbed Rushdie before being tackled by spectators, institution staff and two local law enforcement officers providing security.</p> <p>Rushdie had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/13/we-internalised-the-fatwa-against-salman-rushdie-this-horrific-attack-is-what-follows\">under a </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/13/we-internalised-the-fatwa-against-salman-rushdie-this-horrific-attack-is-what-follows\">fatwa</a></em> calling for his death since 1989, when the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued it in response to the Indian-born author’s controversial novel <em>The Satanic Verses</em>. The Iranian regime has since sought to distance itself from the fatwa, but the price on Rushdie’s head was increased in recent years to more than $3m.</p> <p>Many Muslims viewed Rushdie’s book as blasphemous because – among other things – it included a character that they interpreted as an insult to the prophet Muhammad, the founder of their faith.</p> <p><em>The Satanic Verses</em> was published a decade before Matar was born to parents who emigrated from Lebanon. But, according to reports, his social media activity suggests an admiration of Iran and an attraction to Shia extremism.</p> <p>Just a fortnight ago, Rushdie had talked to the German news magazine <em>Stern</em> about his safety. The author said his life would have been in a lot more danger if social media had been around at the time he wrote <em>The Satanic Verses</em>: “More dangerous, infinitely more dangerous”.</p> <p>“A fatwa is a serious thing. Luckily we didn’t have the internet back then. The Iranians had send the fatwa to the mosques by fax. That’s all a long time ago. Nowadays my life is very normal again.” Asked what made him afraid now, Rushdie said: “In the past I would have said religious fanaticism. I no longer say that. The biggest danger facing us right now is that we lose our democracy. Since the supreme court abortion verdict I have been seriously concerned that the US won’t manage that. That the problems are irreparable and the country will break apart. Today’s greatest danger facing us is this kind of cryptofascism that we see in America and elsewhere.</p> <p>“Oh, we live in scary times. That’s true even though I always tell people: don’t be afraid. But the bad thing is that death threats have become more normal. Not only politicians get them, even American teachers who take certain books off the syllabus.</p> <p>“Look at how many guns there are in America. The existence of all these weapons in itself is scary. I think a lot of people today live with similar threats to the ones I had back then. And the fax machines they used against me is like a bicycle rather than a Ferrari compared with the internet.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"776b73ba606335ba821b89663acc884bd2fad8d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/776b73ba606335ba821b89663acc884bd2fad8d5/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police and FBI search the home of the suspect after Rushdie was stabbed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police and FBI search the home of the suspect after Rushdie was stabbed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said he was happy his books were being reviewed on the arts pages rather than in the political sections of the newspapers.</p> <p><em>Stern</em> asked him what his advice was for people who were scared of where the world is heading: “I believe something very good is happening in the young generation: it is much more inclined to activism. We are seeing a generation grow of age that we urgently need right now, a combative one. We need people who can organise themselves, and people who are prepared to fight. Fighters. For a society worth living in. Instead of hoping things turn out for the best. As an author I also notice that young authors are becoming role models again – instead of the way it used to be, namely just the dead ones.”</p> <p>Questions were being asked yesterday about how Matar gained access to the event. Paul Susko, a lawyer based in Erie – the town in Pennsylvania where Rushdie is now on a ventilator at UPMC Hamot hospital – said that participants were prevented from bringing in food and drink to the hall but that was all.</p> <p>“There was screening to prevent attendees from bringing in a cup of coffee,” Susko said. He added that “maybe screening for weapons” with wand or walk-through metal detectors “would have been more helpful”.</p> <p>Susko, who came to the event with his son, was in the front row on the side of the stage where Matar rushed at the author. “There was no security stopping us from getting to the stage,” Susko said. “There was zero security visible around the stage at the time of the attack.”</p> <p>Several people in the audience said that Matar was dressed in black and wearing a mask. “We thought perhaps it was part of a stunt to show that there’s still a lot of controversy around this author,” said witness Kathleen Jones. “But it became evident in a few seconds that it wasn’t.”</p> <p>Chautauqua Institution began life as a summer camp for Sunday school teachers and grew into a major hub of cultural exchange and dialogue. Hours after the attack, the institution’s president, Michael Hill, said the site had seen nothing like it in almost 150 years of existence. </p> <p>He said: “We were founded to bring people together in community, to learn and in doing so to create solutions, to develop empathy and to take on intractable problems. Today, we are called to take on fear and the worst of all human traits: hate.”</p> <p>Hill confirmed Matar had a ticket for the event “the same way any other patron would have”. He stressed that the institution was open to anyone, as part of its mission of inclusivity.</p> <p>Asked whether there should have been beefed-up security with metal detectors present, given the sensitivities around Rushdie, he said: “We are proud of the security we have.”</p> <p>Discussions were held before Friday’s talk between state and local police and the institution, and two police officers were assigned – a state trooper and a local deputy. Eugene Staniszewski of the New York state police told a press conference that law enforcement had talks with the institution at the start of the season.</p> <p>“There were some high-profile events they had requested some law enforcement presence be there, and luckily they were,” he said. The governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, praised the trooper for his actions. “It was a state police officer who stood up and saved his life, protected him as well as the moderator who was attacked,” she said.</p> <p>Rushdie had no security of his own. When asked whether the organisers should have made efforts to filter attendees entering the premises, Hill vehemently disagreed.</p> <p>“Our mission is to build bridges across difference,” he said. “Mr Rushdie is known as one of the most significant champions for freedom of speech. One of the worst things that Chautauqua could do is back away from its mission.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/13/mind-mangler-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-mischief-theatre-magic-goes-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T19:00:48Z","webTitle":"Mind Mangler review – Magic Goes Wrong spin-off is all fun and mind games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/13/mind-mangler-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-mischief-theatre-magic-goes-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/13/mind-mangler-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-mischief-theatre-magic-goes-wrong","fields":{"headline":"Mind Mangler review – Magic Goes Wrong spin-off is all fun and mind games","trailText":"Mischief Theatre are up to their old tricks as silly slapstick meets telepathy in a send-up of stage mentalism","byline":"Brian Logan","body":"<p>Stage mentalism – the world of Derren Brown and David Blaine, with its puffed-up mystique and pretence to danger – is there for the mickey-taking.

It’s a good gag, that one, and there are more, as our host (played by Henry Lewis) fails to mind-read our names, struggles to heal a woman’s eyesight with his hypnotic skills – and strives to rebrand those failures as successes using melodramatic commentary alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/13/head-set-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-victoria-melody\">Head Set review – a backstage tour of standup comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My caveat is that it’s often the same couple of gags (he’s crap at magic; his life’s a mess) over and again. We get it so much in the first quarter, one wonders where the show has left to go. The answer is: bona fide magic. Soon, the Mangler’s tricks start working, which makes minimal narrative sense but gives the real-world audience a bit more bang for their buck.</p> <p>For anyone who’s seen Derren Brown and co, the Mind Mangler’s feats, while accomplished, don’t take the breath away. As in the West End show, there’s little jeopardy when his hand is poised to slap down on concealed broken glass. By this stage, we know that nothing is to be taken at face value. I’d prefer a defter balance between the silly and the maybe-serious, but that’s not Mischief’s style. Here, jokes are over-telegraphed: the Mangler’s domestic strife more scream than subtext; the plant in the audience made so obvious, he might as well be painted in chlorophyll.

The consequences of sitting idly by are unthinkable.”</p> <p>Starmer, who returned from holiday at the end of last week, has come under pressure to say more on energy prices after former Labour leader Gordon Brown made the running with a series of major interventions.</p> <p>In the Observer last weekend, Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/06/gordon-brown-set-emergency-budget-or-risk-a-winter-of-dire-poverty\">called for an emergency budget</a>. He has also demanded the freezing of the price cap, as well as the temporary nationalisation of energy companies which refuse to offer lower bills.</p> <p>In a pointed remark which some saw as a glancing reference to Starmer, Brown wrote in the<em> </em>Guardian<em> </em>last week: “Time and tide wait for no one. Neither do crises. They don’t take holidays and politely hang fire.”</p> <p>It is understood that Starmer will call on the government to instruct Ofgem to freeze the cap on bills, saying it is within its power to do so.</p> <p>Senior sources said the choice for Labour had been between supporting huge amounts of extra cash help to the most vulnerable or preventing a massive autumn hike in energy prices happening at source. “It seemed best to stop the rise happening in the first place,” said a senior insider.</p> <p>In response to rapidly rising wholesale prices, Ofgem warned in May that the cap would have to rise by around 40% to about £2,800 in October. Since then, forecasts have shot up, with analysts at <a href=\"https://www.cornwall-insight.com/price-cap-forecasts-for-january-rise-to-over-4200-as-wholesale-prices-surge-again-and-ofgem-revises-cap-methodology/\" title=\"\">Cornwall Insight</a> last week predicting an increase of £3,582, more than 80% higher than the current limit. They also forecast further increases to £4,266 in the first quarter of 2023.</p> <p>New analysis for the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, commissioned by the Economic Change Unit, finds that freezing the price cap would not only save families more than £2,000 but also help peg back inflation, preventing it from being “embedded” in the economy.</p> <p>The research says that if the cap were to be lifted to £3,600, as predicted, inflation would soar to around 13%, but if it were frozen at £1,917, inflation would be held at 9.2%.</p> <p>Sarah-Jayne Clifton, executive director of the Economic Change Unit, said it was time for government to act and make energy companies pay: “Other countries have held down prices to protect the financial security of citizens. There is absolutely no reason why our government can’t do the same and shift the burden on to those profiteering from this crisis.”</p> <p>The energy price cap, introduced in 2019, limits the maximum amount energy suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used.</p> <p>In their letter to Sunak and Truss the 70 charities and other organisations, including JRF, AgeUK, Trussell Trust, Children’s Society, the TUC, Shelter, MacMillan Cancer Support, Mind, Oxfam GB and Action for Children, tell the Tory leadership candidates that “the cost of living crisis on low-income households is the gravest issue our country faces”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a007dd7db0ca33c495a36615cebb9801da36cba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a007dd7db0ca33c495a36615cebb9801da36cba2/1_0_2559_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charities have warned Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss that the soaring cost of living is the gravest crisis facing Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They add: “So far this year, nearly three-quarters of low-income households receiving universal credit or other means-tested benefits, many of them working families, have been forced to go without at least one essential. This means people having to skip meals or not being able to heat their homes properly.</p> <p>“Many of our organisations work directly with these families and are becoming overwhelmed, too often unable to provide the support so desperately needed. </p> <p>“This situation cannot be allowed to continue. As the prospective leaders of this country, we urge you to act now to demonstrate the compassion and leadership needed to tackle this issue head on.”</p> <p>Isabel Hughes, policy engagement manager at the Food Foundation, who also signed the letter, said: “Continuing price rises and the approach of winter will continue to make life harder for low-income families, and those who have received proportionally less support so far are at particular risk. The government urgently needs to shield families from the worst impacts to protect children’s health and future.”</p> <p>New polling for the Liberal Democrats, who also back a cap freeze, on Sunday reveal that seven out of 10 Tory voters back plans to cancel the October rise. The party leader, Ed Davey, said the move should be funded through “a tougher windfall tax on the energy giants making record profits”.</p> <p>Labour said last night its plans to insulate more homes would save millions of families more than £1,000. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “Twelve years of failure by the Conservatives to insulate our homes is one of the reasons bills are so high. Too many working people and pensioners live in draughty, cold homes with high heating costs. If they were serious about cutting bills, they could start right now, by delivering the warm homes plan Labour has called for. A proper national mission would save 19 million families over £1,000 on bills and boost our energy security.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/14/salvation-of-new-zealands-dying-giant-kauri-trees-may-have-roots-in-maori-wisdom","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T19:00:48Z","webTitle":"Salvation of New Zealand’s dying giant kauri trees may have roots in Māori wisdom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/14/salvation-of-new-zealands-dying-giant-kauri-trees-may-have-roots-in-maori-wisdom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/14/salvation-of-new-zealands-dying-giant-kauri-trees-may-have-roots-in-maori-wisdom","fields":{"headline":"Salvation of New Zealand’s dying giant kauri trees may have roots in Māori wisdom","trailText":"The country’s largest trees, kauri are threatened by dieback and climate change.

This is a very real thing that’s happening to our forest.”</p> <p>This park is the frontline of the battle to save kauri (<em>Agathis australis</em>) – Aotearoa’s largest, most sacred trees.

Most have been closed off to the public for almost five years now, in a radical effort to buy time and breathing room to protect the trees that are still healthy. Today, conservationists say there are some glimmers of hope for New Zealand’s kauri – and the most optimistic strategies reflect a gradual transformation of how New Zealand approaches conservation, with Māori knowledge on the frontlines.</p> <h2>‘That tree has watched over generations’</h2> <p>Five years ago, Edward Ashby was there as his iwi [tribe], Te Kawerau ā Maki, stood in front of Aunt Agatha and laid a rāhui: a cultural ban on human entry, placed to protect tapu [sacred] or ecologically fragile places. Back then, he says, “she still had the crown of leaves”. He likens her death to the loss of an ancestor.</p> <p>“That tree has watched over entire generations of Kawerau people, and even the ancestors before … right back to human origins in this country,” says Ashby, who is the tribe’s conservation lead. “It’s watched us as a people grow up, right from when the first waka arrived.”</p> <p>The initial government response to Kauri dieback, after the pathogen was identified in 2008, was criticised as piecemeal and insufficient, with some scientists predicting the trees would be extinct within a few decades.</p> <p>Without centralised government action, often it was iwi [Māori tribes] that stepped into the gap, creating protections for the trees to try to buy scientists more time. Rāhui became one of the central tools used to keep fragile regions safe.

Instead, Scott McTominay was the sole player to be dropped from an opening weekend disappointment that now resembles happy, optimistic times.</p> \n<p>Alongside McTominay’s erstwhile partner in crime, Fred, Eriksen played the deep, central midfield role from which he helped haul Brentford to safety last season, with notably less success. A vocal minority of home fans were in unforgiving mood for his choice of Manchester over west London, his early touches booed, and hearty reminders of the scoreline.</p> \n<p>Josh Dasilva’s goal had rescued a point at Leicester last Sunday and he got the nod, a team selection from Thomas Frank paying off in a fashion Ten Hag can only dream of. He must envy their energy and application, too. Brentford played their usual, athletic game, pressing hard, making full use of set-pieces, of which they were offered plenty by United’s persistent fouling in utter desperation.</p> \n<p>“We knew the high press would affect them,” said the excellent Ivan Toney. “It was clear to see that if you work hard, you get the result.” Mathias Jensen, dominant in midfield, said: “It felt like we were on top of everything.”</p> \n<p>“We looked at what Brighton did well against them,” said Frank. “We knew we had that weapon.”</p> \n<p>Dasilva’s long-range opener came through a combination of aggression, submissiveness and incompetence. Jensen easily robbed Ronaldo and De Gea made a not uncharacteristic mistake. For all his regular brilliance, the Spaniard is prone to clangers. The ball having trickled over the line, he buried his head in the turf.</p> \n<p>“I’m just taking my responsibility today,” said De Gea, accepting responsibility. “I think I cost three points for my team. It was a poor performance from myself.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e275749ba8f569545ad95e4e23fb98c63901411e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e275749ba8f569545ad95e4e23fb98c63901411e/0_0_3792_2528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryan Mbeumo and Brentford celebrate their victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryan Mbeumo and Brentford celebrate their victory.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>De Gea was not alone in ineptitude. Far from it. Harry Maguire was only saved from a red card when bringing down Toney because Martínez was on the crime scene. And as United uncomfortably attempted to play the ball out from a goal-kick, Eriksen was played into trouble by Martínez. Jensen stole in for the second.</p> \n<p>Just 18 minutes played and Ronaldo barking at his teammates while Brentford fans were predicting Ten Hag would be “sacked in the morning”. Thirteen minutes later, Ben Mee stooped at the back post to score after Toney nodded a corner across. The next was simpler yet, Jensen robbing Jadon Sancho in the box, releasing Toney, who played in Bryan Mbeumo as Brentford sailed through unchecked.</p> \n<p>Ten Hag’s half-time reaction, his attempt to lift the shell shock, was to remove the hapless Martínez and Luke Shaw, and swap McTominay in for Fred. United looked a little more solid, though still fragile, their attacking still hapless.</p> \n<p>They at least enjoyed some territory. Ronaldo’s first chances both came from Diogo Dalot crosses and he beat the turf in anger after heading both over. He was soon found dropping deep as he attempted to make something, anything happen, perhaps rescue his own evening with a goal.</p> \n<p>Eriksen forced the first save of the match from the Brentford goalkeeper, David Raya, with a weak header, as the home side sat back on their gaping advantage, able to savour the occasion. Jensen, Mbeumo and Dasilva left the field to deserved standing ovations on a famous Brentford day, a first defeat of United since 1938 that will live long in the memory. The celebrations afterwards were riotous and lengthy.</p> \n<p>For Ten Hag, and all those hoping Manchester United can one day revive, this will linger as a fevered nightmare, a new yet familiar low.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/aug/13/nottingham-forest-sudden-success-too-many-changes","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T18:00:47Z","webTitle":"Has Nottingham Forest’s sudden ascent led to too many changes? | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/13/nottingham-forest-sudden-success-too-many-changes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/aug/13/nottingham-forest-sudden-success-too-many-changes","fields":{"headline":"Has Nottingham Forest’s sudden ascent led to too many changes?","trailText":"Promoted club have brought in more than a dozen players this summer, illustrating that progress can be destabilising","byline":"Jonathan Wilson","body":"<p>When was it that alarm bells began to ring?

That figure, irrespective of the quality of the players or the logic of each individual signing, is enough to inspire a qualm of anxiety.</p> <p>Premier League history is dotted with the minatory lessons of the overspenders. Nobody wants to do a Middlesbrough 1996-97, a Derby 2006-07, a QPR 2011-12 or a Fulham 2018-19. The dangers of mass changes should be clear, but the riches of the Premier League can do strange things to directors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/jul/06/football-transfer-window-summer-2022-mens-deals-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1-club-guides\">Football transfer window summer 2022 – Europe’s top five men’s leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Six of Forest’s new signings started the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/06/newcastle-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-0 defeat at Newcastle</a> last Saturday and two more came off the bench. There were eight changes from the team that started the playoff final. If Forest looked disjointed, it’s hardly surprising. While Forest’s board have actively chosen the degree of turbulence, some level of flux is inevitable.</p> <p>Forest’s rise was sudden. They were bottom when Steve Cooper was appointed in September and played themselves into the playoff spots only in April.</p> <p>By the end of the season, they had five loanees as regular starters, none of whom joined the club on a permanent basis, while the goalkeeper Brice Samba refused a contract extension and left for Lens. That’s immediately half a team that needs replacing, which is part of the problem of a strategy based on reducing liability by relying on loan deals. This is not to say such a policy is wrong as such – it may be financially necessary – but it does create instability.</p> <p>Even leaving that aside, economic reality means that significant change is probably necessary if a promoted team are to compete. That there is a vast gulf between the Premier League and the Championship (and a growing one between the Championship and League One) is obvious. But there is something corrosive about that stratification; it’s another little bit of football’s soul lost in the pursuit of profit that has characterised the three decades of the Premier League era.</p> <p>The cases of Ipswich in 1961-62 and Nottingham Forest in 1977-78, winning the title in their first season after promotion with essentially the same squad, are extreme, but might it not be nice if promotion did not mean having to replace the majority of the squad that achieved it? Anybody who has played a team sport at any level (or watched <em>Ocean’s 11</em> or <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>) knows the power of that sense of a group of often very different individuals coming together in common cause, different attributes meshing to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"709a06e32f4fdd2a4ab15af3fed7ab7aab982334\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/709a06e32f4fdd2a4ab15af3fed7ab7aab982334/98_259_2902_1741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nottingham Forest captain John McGovern holds the League Championship trophy aloft as he and his team-mates celebrate their triumph in April 1978\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nottingham Forest captain John McGovern holds the League Championship trophy aloft as he and his team-mates celebrate their triumph in April 1978, (left-right) Tony Woodcock, John Robertson, Kenny Burns, McGovern, Peter Shilton, Viv Anderson and Colin Barrett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe it’s naive to believe that should be the case at the highest level as well – the idea of friendships within football has been scorned by enough former pros to make clear that it’s an industry as grubby and bitter as any other – but for fans the idea the players wearing their colours have somehow committed to their values and their identity feels vital. What is a club, if it is not that feeling of communality? Otherwise there’s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAh8HryVaeY\" title=\"\">Trigger’s broom situation</a>: if you change every component, what makes it still Nottingham Forest?</p> <p>Yet that requires a significant suspension of disbelief. Players will move on for better offers. Clubs will jettison players they no longer need just as quickly – a tendency of which the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/12/barcelona-race-against-time-amid-desperate-grasp-at-short-term-levers\" title=\"\">current shenanigans at Barcelona</a> are just an extreme example. Football is a brutal, mercenary world, the sense that it somehow matters based not quite on a fiction, but on something that is, at best, fleeting and ephemeral. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the case of a promoted side.</p> <p>Even as the vital points are secured, or as the playoff final is won, executives are finalising plans of who to buy, how to bring in the necessary experience, the top-flight quality. And so, inevitably, of who to let go, who is unmitigatedly Championship in standard, whose wages have to be cleared from the books.</p> <p>That is not to blame the execs; that is what they ought to be doing. In modern football there can be no passengers, no room for sentiment. Thanks very much for your service, stalwart box-to-boxer of the second-flight slog who dragged us over the line, but we’ve managed to get mid-table Ligue 1 side X down to 15mil for their up-and-coming holding midfielder Y.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7775fc1a12f1c8407bef9f8073a41ace4a8baff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7775fc1a12f1c8407bef9f8073a41ace4a8baff4/0_0_2798_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper last weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"811\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper last weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Do players ever feel the futility of that, knowing there’s a good chance that promotion will mean their departure? What emotional bonds can fans really form with players who are likely to be moved on for having achieved success? Progress can sometimes feel very destabilising; there is something oddly self-sacrificial in those players who cast their futures into doubt by winning promotion.</p> <p>And what chance then a manager, not only having to cope with a step up in level, but also with moulding a squad of players who have never met before into a team? Even Danny Ocean was only putting together a team of 11 – and his casino robbers were not competing against better-resourced gangs who had been working together for years. Aston Villa bought 15 players in the summer of 2019 and survived, but only by a point and largely because they already had Jack Grealish.</p> <p>The teams who do best having gone up – Brentford, Leeds, Wolves, Swansea – tend to be those with a clearly defined philosophy and a well-practised style. Success came too suddenly for Forest to be able to achieve that and the result is the mass purchase of this summer.</p> <p>Cooper is a highly promising manager but turning this season into an episode of <em>Ready</em><em> Steady</em><em> Cook</em> has made his task almost impossibly hard.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/13/the-starting-point-was-zero-chelseas-emma-hayes-marks-10-years-of-glory-and-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T18:00:47Z","webTitle":"‘The starting point was zero’: Chelsea’s Emma Hayes marks 10 years of glory and growth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/the-starting-point-was-zero-chelseas-emma-hayes-marks-10-years-of-glory-and-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/13/the-starting-point-was-zero-chelseas-emma-hayes-marks-10-years-of-glory-and-growth","fields":{"headline":"‘The starting point was zero’: Chelsea’s Emma Hayes marks 10 years of glory and growth","trailText":"Manager has enjoyed a trophy-laden decade at the club but still wants more for her own side and women’s football as a whole","byline":"Suzanne Wrack","body":"<p>“I feel like I don’t need to shout the loudest any more,” says Emma Hayes.

Sometimes I wanted more from my colleagues in the game, I wanted them to shout as loud as I did. That was happening in private, but I felt like I put my head above the parapet. Whether it was to create minimum standards, demand more for officials or professionalise the game, I figured: ‘You’ve just got to do it.

People say: ‘You have a big budget, you spend money’ – why shouldn’t I try and get the most [for] women I represent? I don’t feel ashamed of that. I wish everybody would have that mentality instead of a fear mentality, that we’re always going to face expulsion or fold as a club. I know all those things have happened as part of the game, but I’ve always wanted to go strive for something bigger.</p> <p>“Many times I’ve had to sacrifice myself and just push. Even if I was like: ‘I’m going to get punched,’ at the same time. It’s been lonely doing that for such a long time. However, I look across us now, the Lionesses, everybody else, the coaches across the game, and I feel like I don’t need to shout the loudest any more.”</p> <p>Picking the battles for her and the women’s side’s general manager, Paul Green, isn’t easy. “It’s so crucial to have good sounding boards and I have that,” says Hayes. “Paul and I sit side by side. I don’t know how many offices where the general manager and the head coach sit in the same office.

Of course, everybody always wants more, but my glass is half-full. I’m happy. I have got great people, great staff, working here.

The players will tell me when they really, really need something and I will do my best for them.”</p> <p>What’s the next step? “The league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body,” says Hayes. “And that there is a vision around the women’s game so we don’t just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – [but] that they’re every week.</p> <p>“We need the expertise coming into the game.

Here are the latest developments as it just passes 10am in Kyiv.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s military said its artillery hit a Russian ammunition depot near a key bridge in the south</strong> and added it now had the ability to strike nearly all of Moscow’s supply lines in the occupied region. Reuters reported there was no immediate comment from Russian authorities on the report of the attack in Kherson province, or the purported reach of Ukraine’s firepower.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UN has urged a demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant </strong>as Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over more shelling. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said the facility in the country’s south-east had been shelled five times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. Valentyn Reznichenko, the Dnipropetrovsk region’s governor, reportedly said three civilians – including a boy – were wounded in overnight shelling on Friday in Marhanets, a town opposite the plant.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told government officials to stop talking to reporters about Kyiv’s military tactics against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a></strong>, saying such remarks are “frankly irresponsible<strong>”.</strong> In the wake of major blasts that wrecked a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers cited unidentified officials as saying Ukrainian forces were responsible. The government in Kyiv, on the other hand, declined to say whether it had been behind the explosions.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UK Ministry of Defence has said the explosions at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea earlier in the week were “almost certainly” from the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas</strong>, though what set them off remained unclear. At least five Su-24 Fencer fighter-bombers and three Su-30 Flanker H multi-role jets were almost certainly destroyed or seriously damaged in the blasts, according to British intelligence.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The devastation at the Russian air base in Crimea suggests Kyiv may have obtained new long-range strike capability </strong>with potential to change the course of the war. The base is well beyond the range of advanced rockets that western countries acknowledge sending to Ukraine so far, with some western military experts saying the scale of the damage and the apparent precision of the strike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show\">suggested a powerful new capability</a> with potentially important implications.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s security agencies issued a joint statement calling for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a> and the International Committee of the Red Cross to send representatives to locations where Russia is holding Ukrainian prisoners of war. </strong>The request on Friday follows earlier allegations by Kyiv that Moscow’s forces have tortured and executed prisoners, including by staging an explosion in a Ukrainian PoW camp in Olenivka.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted that he spoke with Pope Francis </strong>on Friday. “Informed about the aggression that the Russian Federation is carrying out against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, about the terrible crimes of Russia,” the president wrote on Twitter.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said a shipment of M20 MLRS tanks has arrived in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>. </strong>In a tweet, he thanked the UK’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, and British people for the donation, which had been pledged earlier. “Your support is amazing and so important for Ukraine.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Jose Andres, whose World Central Kitchen group has served more than 130m meals in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> since Russia’s invasion in February, called for better coordination of food relief efforts </strong>ahead of what promises to be a brutal winter.<strong> </strong>Donations were easing as the war dragged on, he warned, which meant that WCK, which provides short-term emergency relief, must start winding down operations just as cold weather is likely to exacerbate problems facing millions of displaced Ukrainians.</p></li> <li><p><strong>India said on Friday there was no pressure on it from western countries or anywhere else over its energy purchases from Russia</strong>, as Indian firms step up imports of oil and coal from the country shunned by others for its invasion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>. India, the world’s third-biggest crude importer, overtook China to become the biggest buyer of Russian oil in July based on sea-borne volumes, having bought very little from Russia before the start of the war in Ukraine in February.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-13T07:15:40.965Z\">at 8.15am BST</time></p>  </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/13/british-rowing-bounces-back-with-four-golds-in-european-championships","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T17:15:10Z","webTitle":"British rowing bounces back with four golds in European Championships","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/13/british-rowing-bounces-back-with-four-golds-in-european-championships","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/13/british-rowing-bounces-back-with-four-golds-in-european-championships","fields":{"headline":"British rowing bounces back with four golds in European Championships","trailText":"The British rowing team won four golds on a sunny morning at the European Championships, while there were silver medals in BMX and gymnastics","byline":"Mark Woods in Munich","body":"<p>Glorious history placed a weighty burden on the shoulders of the UK’s rowers at the Tokyo Olympics.

Everyone’s really bought into it.”</p> <p>A string of second bests were inflicted upon the Netherlands. The women’s quad sculls pack of Jess Leyden, Lola Anderson, Georgina Brayshaw and Lucy Glover were brutally dominant, clear of the Dutch by more than three seconds. Four seconds was the margin of victory for the men’s eights while the fours won by two seconds, leading early and finishing strong.</p> <p>These were markers laid down, not just for next month’s world championships in the Czech Republic, but for Paris in 2024.</p> <p>“We are a fresh crew of young guys who have never been to an Olympic Games,” said Sam Nunn, fours champion with Will Stewart, Matt Aldridge and Freddie Davidson. “These are massively important to find out about the pressure of a major championships, performing on multiple days and stepping up through the rounds.

Not that he will hide from the challenge.</p> <p>Elgar is a cricketer from a previous age. A red-ball specialist who has built a 10-year career with little more than a nudge off his hips and an inelegant drive, he shuns celebrity and avoids social media. “I’ve got better things to do than tweet,” he says.</p> <p>Raised by a disciplinarian father in the mining town of Welkom in the heart of the country, he favours frugality over flamboyance, both with his words and his approach to his craft.</p> <p>“People can say what they want, trust me, I don’t really give a shit,” he says when asked how he felt about the words “nuggety” and “combative”, adjectives that have followed him ever since he made a pair on debut, against Australia in Perth in 2012. “It never bothered me. I don’t have my head in my arse and I don’t read anything people say or write about me. Maybe that’s made me the character I am today.”</p> <p>Some of Elgar’s best Test runs – 4,864 at just under 40 – have been scored on difficult pitches in challenging circumstances. His unbeaten 96 against India in the fourth innings at the Wanderers in January was one of the great knocks by a South Africa captain. That five-hour marathon included numerous blows from Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, and helped square the three-match series. A week later his team won again, securing a 2-1 triumph despite suffering a crushing defeat in the first Test.</p> <p>But captaining an international cricket team often requires a soft touch. Factor in the extra political and social baggage that comes with the job in South Africa and people skills become just as important as the ability to set a field or rejig a bowling attack.</p> <p>“That was definitely a weakness of mine at first,” Elgar says, reflecting on his appointment in June last year after the short-lived experiment with the wicketkeeper-batter Quinton de Kock at the helm. “I’m man enough to say that it was a weakness and that I needed to better myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ce699d85f0cb4fa623687d1503b2c344f258c36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ce699d85f0cb4fa623687d1503b2c344f258c36/0_17_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Elgar celebrates reaching his century on the final day of South Africa’s third Test against England at the Oval in 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Elgar celebrates reaching his century on the final day of South Africa’s third Test against England at the Oval in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“If you want to have the position I hold, you have to adapt and develop that side, otherwise you’ll lose some teammates along the way. It’s about relationships and keeping those as a priority. I’m not the finished article. There is a lot of work I have to do.”</p> <p>Elgar took the wheel of a teetering ship. Cricket South Africa was still recovering from its damaged reputation after several years of mismanagement and the Covid‑19 pandemic had squeezed the organisation’s income, with lucrative series against England and Australia abandoned. Perennial racial tensions were coming to a head and would burst at the social justice and nation-building (SJN) hearings that revealed a deep cultural rot at all levels within the sport. Was Elgar really the right man for these troubled times?</p> <p>“I had to deal with a lot of off-field things and I didn’t expect to be thrown in the lion’s den,” he says with an involuntary laugh. “The team environment was being impacted by the negative press. The players didn’t deserve that and it was starting to have an impact on some of the guys.</p> <p>“We became an easy target for journalists who wrote a lot of crappy articles. It made us tighter. We used that negativity but never allowed it to infiltrate the camp.</p> <p>“You could say the team needed someone who wasn’t willing to take second best. Who wasn’t willing to take any bullshit. I’ve always been an honest person. That is how you get the best out of players. It [the SJN hearings] was the best thing that could have happened. Just purely knowing more about what Black people go through and what the different cultures experience in this country. And that includes the Afrikaans guys in the team, the Coloured [mixed-race] guys, the Indian [south-Asian] guys. All those communities experience South Africa in a different way and that whole process has been incorporated well.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/16/lungi-ngidi-racism-is-a-factor-in-south-africa-that-must-be-addressed\">Lungi Ngidi: ‘Racism is a factor in South Africa that must be addressed’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elgar says there were moments when he considered quitting. “I think we all felt that but as players we weren’t in a position to say anything. We had to keep quiet and focus on what we could control.”</p> <p>A series win in the Caribbean preceded the victory over India. They then became the second side in five years to avoid a series defeat in New Zealand, with a 1-1 draw, before a clean sweep of Bangladesh at home. With little fanfare, the Proteas have ascended to the top of the ICC World Test Championship table.</p> <p>“What we’ve done on the field has been neglected,” Elgar says, though this will be his toughest challenge yet. The team’s batting looks thin but no previous South Africa captain has had such a versatile attack to work with. Rabada, Nortje and Ngidi are a trio of menacing quicks ably supported by the left-arm seamer Marco Jansen, who is 2m tall, as well as two fine spinners in Keshav Maharaj and Harmer.</p> <p>Whether he is buying the hype or not, Bazball is coming. He has promised to confront it with the same grit and gumption that now define him.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/13/angela-rasmussen-on-covid-19-this-origins-discussion-is-the-worst-thing-about-twitter","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T17:00:46Z","webTitle":"Angela Rasmussen on Covid-19: ‘This origins discussion is the worst thing about Twitter’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/13/angela-rasmussen-on-covid-19-this-origins-discussion-is-the-worst-thing-about-twitter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/13/angela-rasmussen-on-covid-19-this-origins-discussion-is-the-worst-thing-about-twitter","fields":{"headline":"Angela Rasmussen on Covid-19: ‘This origins discussion is the worst thing about Twitter’","trailText":"Did Sars-CoV-2 emerge from a Huanan market stall or a lab?

Last month, she and 17 co-authors published <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715\">findings in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715\">Science</a></em> that they feel should silence all rational critics on the question.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There’s really no explanation other than that the virus started spreading in the human population at that market</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>In the </strong><em><strong>Science</strong></em><strong> paper</strong><strong>, which started life as a <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/6299116#.Yu4_Fi8RpN1\">preprint</a> in February before going through peer review,</strong><strong> you say that the </strong><strong>Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan</strong><strong> was the “early epicentre” of the Covid-19 pandemic. To be clear, are you saying that the Huanan market was the origin of the pandemic?<br></strong>That is what the research heavily implies. We are not able to pinpoint the exact spillover event, the exact animal from which the virus crossed into humans, but there’s really no other explanation for what our analysis shows. And that is that there weren’t any Covid-19 cases in Wuhan or anywhere else prior to these early cases that we looked at, which are all strongly associated with the market.</p> <p><strong>What does your paper add that is new?<br></strong>Nobody disputes that there were a lot of early cases associated with the market. The question was, could the virus have come from elsewhere and just been amplified at the market? First, we did a lot of detective work to see if there was a geographical relationship between those early cases. Their geospatial coordinates had been available but nobody had conducted that kind of analysis before. Importantly, when we excluded the early cases that had a direct link with the market – meaning the patient had been there – the association with the market <em>became even stronger</em>. That’s consistent with the virus acquiring the capacity for human-to-human transmission at the market, so that people who hadn’t been there started catching it from those who had. It radiated out like ripples on a pond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb41f339e0a10bece1ae72723801bdb4f83ebc1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb41f339e0a10bece1ae72723801bdb4f83ebc1c/0_234_6048_3628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers in protective clothing at the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, in March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers in protective clothing at the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, in March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Héctor Retamal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Second, we have known since June 2021 that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91470-2\">many species of live animal were on sale</a> at Huanan. We obtained plans of the market, and legal and business records regarding what species were sold at the various stalls, and we cross-referenced these with data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) about swabs taken from surfaces in the market in early 2020, that tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19. These positive samples clustered in the part of the market where the live animals were sold; they came from cages, carts and equipment that had been in contact with those animals. That wasn’t widely known.</p> <p>By a crazy coincidence, in 2014 one of my co-authors, <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/edward-holmes.html\">Edward Holmes</a>, had taken a picture showing one particular stall where live raccoon dogs – which are susceptible to Sars-CoV-2 – were kept in cages stacked on a cart. He took the photo while being given a tour of the market by Chinese scientists who considered it to be at high risk of viral spillover. That stall later produced five samples positive for Sars-CoV-2.</p> <p>Finally, we showed that many of the species on sale at the market are susceptible to infection by Sars-CoV-2. We were the first ones to put all this evidence together, and to say that when you look at the whole picture, there’s really no explanation other than that the virus started spreading in the human population at that market.</p> <p><strong>There was a companion paper to yours in the same issue of </strong><em><strong>Science</strong></em><strong>. What did that show?<br></strong>In the early cases the virus already existed in two distinct lineages, A and B – though confusingly, B was the older of the two. Until February this year it was thought that only lineage B was present at the Huanan market, but then a group led by George Gao, the former head of the CCDC, <a href=\"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1370392/v1\">showed that lineage A</a> was there too [this paper is undergoing peer review]. The <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337\">companion paper</a>, by Jonathan Pekar of the University of California San Diego and colleagues – which I wasn’t involved with – reconstructs their family tree to show that they probably reached humans as a result of two separate spillover events within a couple of weeks of each other.</p> <p>Now, if the virus had escaped from a lab, somebody would have had to get infected with lineage B in the lab, go to the market and infect people there without having infected anyone along the way, and then somebody else would have had to do the exact same thing with lineage A a few weeks later. It’s not impossible, but a simpler explanation is that the virus was brought to the market in an animal, from where it spread to other animals, diverging in the process. The two lineages then spilled over separately into humans.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>No meaningful further studies will happen without Chinese collaboration, and this debate has damaged the chances of that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>One of the criticisms of your paper is that you remain vague on “upstream events” – that is, how the virus got to the market in the first place.<br></strong>That is one thing we don’t know. We do know that the live animal trade uses a common supply chain. Animals are gathered from all over the place, including far-off parts of China, and brought to the market. There may well have been other spillover events upstream, but the other thing to keep in mind about the market is that it’s an environment where human-to-human transmission can be established and sustained – because there are many animals housed in close contact with each other, and many humans milling around them. Spillover events in remote, sparsely inhabited areas <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf8003\">are more likely to be dead ends</a> because there are too few susceptible human hosts. We also know that when a related coronavirus, Sars, emerged in China 20 years ago, it was linked with the live animal trade.</p> <p><strong>Have you ruled out that a lab leak caused the pandemic?<br></strong>I don’t think you could ever completely rule it out, but we have demonstrated pretty conclusively that it came from the market.</p> <p><strong>Could more be found out?<br></strong>Yes. We’re still trying to establish the susceptibility to Sars-CoV-2 of the various species that were on sale at the market. I’d like to see information about the farms where the animals were raised, and any samples taken from those animals before the farms and the market were closed, and the animals culled. These might allow us to identify the intermediate host – the animal from which the virus likely jumped to humans. I’d be curious to see human serology data too, to find out if people working in the live animal trade in 2019-20 had elevated levels of Sars-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood.</p> <p>It is possible that this information exists and we’re not being given access to it, and this is one of the hardest things to discuss with people who support the lab leak theory. If you look at it from the Chinese government’s point of view, though, it’s actually worse if this came from the market. After Sars they were supposed to have cracked down on the live animal trade, so it’s hugely embarrassing for them if the same thing happened again – especially in a city where world-class coronavirologists work. One thing is clear: no meaningful further studies will happen without Chinese collaboration, and this debate has damaged the chances of that.</p> <p><strong>Some scientists who defend a natural origin have been accused of conflicts of interest, generally because they have collaborated with Chinese scientists including researchers working at the </strong><strong>Wuhan Institute of Virology</strong><strong> – the institution most often named as the source of a hypothetical lab leak. Do you have a potential conflict of interest?<br></strong>I have never collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. I’ve never had grants to work in China, and I’ve never been to China. I have nevertheless been accused of a conflict of interest, for work I have done on Mers and Ebola that was funded by the US Department of Defense. Some of the wilder conspiracy theories implicate US biodefence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/18/covid-19-a-blessing-for-pangolins\">Covid-19 – a blessing for pangolins?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What should we take away from this origins debate?<br></strong>Every time a new virus emerges there is a debate over its origins. It’s important to have it, but often there’s an unrealistic expectation that the explanation will be simple. Some of the language doesn’t help – the term “patient zero”, for example. If there were multiple spillover events it may not be theoretically feasible to identify the <em>first</em> person who got sick. You can never entirely prevent the debate from being politicised, but you can do the analyses that are most likely to persuade serious scientists. Some critics will never be satisfied. In the case of Sars-CoV-2, they are twisting themselves into ever more complicated logical pretzels to keep the lab leak theory alive.</p> <p><strong>You’ve been a Twitter warrior throughout, and the debate has been toxic at times. What has that been like?<br></strong>If I had known what it was going to be like, I probably would have never opened my mouth. I’ll also point out that there is a reason there aren’t many female co-authors on this paper. All of us get personal attacks, but the men are accused of being corrupt or evil, whereas we are also accused of being ugly, fat, old, mediocre. I’ve had rape and death threats; I’ve had to call the police. I’ve got pretty high self-esteem, but it wears you down.</p> <p><strong>Should Twitter be regulated?<br></strong>Twitter has good and bad sides. It can be a great place for talking about science, for reaching audiences that you wouldn’t normally reach, for meeting colleagues. It’s how I heard about my current job and yesterday I got a grant for a collaboration that started on Twitter. It’s also how I came to collaborate with my co-authors on this paper. This origins discussion is the worst of the bad things about Twitter, which incentivises abusive behaviour. I do think it should be regulated, but in a way that minimises the abuse, not in a way that silences people I disagree with.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/13/namwali-serpell-i-find-uncertainty-compelling-in-literature","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T17:00:45Z","webTitle":"Namwali Serpell: ‘I find uncertainty compelling in literature’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/namwali-serpell-i-find-uncertainty-compelling-in-literature","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/13/namwali-serpell-i-find-uncertainty-compelling-in-literature","fields":{"headline":"Namwali Serpell: ‘I find uncertainty compelling in literature’","trailText":"The award-winning Zambia-born writer on her reading habits, being emboldened by Toni Morrison, and her belief that books aren’t about self-improvement, but engagement","byline":"Anthony Cummins","body":"<p>Namwali Serpell, 41, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/23/namwali-serpell-wins-arthur-c-clarke-award-the-old-drift\">won the Arthur C Clarke award</a> for science fiction for her first novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/10/the-old-drift-namwali-serpell-review\">The Old Drift</a></em>, a multigenerational, multigenre saga set in Rhodesia and Zambia, where she was born. Shortlisted for the US National Book Critics Circle award for her essay collection <em>Stranger Faces</em>, which was cited for its “wry wit and cultural range”, she has written on subjects including Kenyan writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ngugi-wa-thiong-o\">Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o</a>, HBO’s <em>Watchmen</em> series and, most recently, Zola (the 19th-century French author, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/07/21/shes-capital-zola-namwali-serpell/\">viral tweet thread turned movie</a> of the same name). Her new novel, <em>The Furrows</em>, opens in Baltimore, where she grew up, and involves a recurring series of mysterious encounters experienced by a girl who loses her seven-year-old brother at sea. Serpell, who lives in Harlem, New York, spoke to me from Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she teaches at Harvard.<br><br><strong>Where did </strong><em><strong>The Furrows</strong></em><strong> begin?</strong><br>The first scene came to me as a dream when I was getting my PhD in 2008. I was in the water with a young boy, trying to swim him to shore, and I woke in the kind of panic that reminded me of the dreams I used to have following the death of my older sister, who died when I was 18 and she was 22. I started to think about how that immersion in dream space felt like memory but also fantasy; I wanted to try to capture the waves of grief that I experienced when I would wake up from a dream about her and realise once again that she had died.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The equation of reading with morally positive effects [resembles] the neoliberal model of eating well and doing exercise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Were you conscious that the novel’s structure might puzzle readers?</strong><br>Oh, yeah! It’s OK, you can say it [laughs], I know it’s not an easy book. One of the reasons I wrote my dissertation on experimental texts that play with time and fractured consciousness [the basis of Serpell’s 2014 academic study <em>Seven Modes of Uncertainty</em>] was that I was finding it very difficult to deal with uncertainty in real life, as most of us do, yet found it incredibly compelling in literature and couldn’t pinpoint why. I wanted the reader to feel snatched: to feel out of sorts but immediately pulled in. The uncertainty about what happened to [the narrator’s] brother, and the identity of the man she’s meeting – or isn’t meeting – aims to evoke a feeling rather than a message. The novel does speak along the way to what it’s like to be mixed race, to be black in America, to be mistaken for somebody else, to negotiate grief within a family, but the form is really an attempt to create an experience more akin to the workings of a poem than to a personal essay on loss.<br><br><strong>What models did you have in mind?</strong><br>Some of what I’m doing at the level of image has to do with a kind of painterliness I’m picking up from Virginia Woolf, but in a deep way the book bears the marks of my engagement with the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/tonimorrison\">Toni Morrison</a>. I recently reread <em>The Bluest Eye</em> and I think the experimental nature of that novel has been greatly reduced reputationally, because the central idea is so compellingly straightforward – a young black girl who wants to have blue eyes. Yet the form of the novel is incredibly complex and it baffled many readers, as did <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1987/oct/16/fiction.asbyatt\">Beloved</a></em>. Morrison’s efforts in her criticism to make sense of why she asks so much of the reader really helped me feel confident that my vision for the novel was worth whatever confusion, or even alienation, it might make readers feel along the way.<br><br><strong>As a critic, you’ve been sceptical about how we tend to construe literary value, not least in your <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/03/02/the-banality-of-empathy/\">2019 essay The Banality of Empathy</a>.</strong><br>The idea that literature’s ethical values stem from its ability to produce empathy has become the be-all and end-all of how we talk about it. The incredible immersion in the minds of others [that fiction offers] is something I wouldn’t be able to live without, but I’d push against the notion that it is valuable for a kind of portable empathy that makes us better people. Many bad people don’t read. Many good people never got to learn how to read. The equation of reading with morally positive effects [resembles] the neoliberal model of eating well and doing exercise. We can see that in the way books are commodified right now: pictures of your latte or smoothie next to a beautiful book cover on Instagram are meant to reflect one’s engagement in a project of self-improvement, rather than actual engagement with other people, talking and thinking about that book. My scepticism isn’t of art – it’s of what we take art to be for.<br><br><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?</strong><br>We came to the US when I was eight and I was very lonely. Reading four books a day by the time I was in sixth grade was a compensatory escape from the culture shock. I read adventure novels, biographies, encyclopedias… My mother used to talk about lighting a candle to read underneath her bed when she was a young girl in rural Zambia and she would liken it to the fact that I used to read under my covers with a lamp in Baltimore when we first moved. My father was a professor so we would have all these academic books and philosophy books. My ranginess as a writer is very much just my ranginess as a reader, and it’s always been a hotchpotch. The first thing we read on the after-school reading programme I was put in after we came to the US was [John Christopher’s 1960s science fiction trilogy] <em>The Tripods</em>. But I wasn’t told this was significantly different from the other novels I’d read, that I was being introduced to another kind of imaginative world.<br><br><strong>What have you read lately?</strong><br>I just finished Howard W French’s magisterial work of history, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/26/born-in-blackness-howard-w-french-review-africa-africans-and-the-making-of-the-modern-world\">Born in Blackness</a></em>, about the making of the modern world and Africa’s unrecognised role in that; it’s a book everybody should read. I enjoyed <em>Call and Response</em>, a beautiful collection of stories by a young Botswanan writer, Gothataone Moeng. And I just read [Henry James’s] <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> for the first time, over the course of about a month while travelling. It’s the sort of book I’ll never teach, because it’s just devastating and I prefer not to ruin the books that ruin me. </p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Furrows </em>by Namwali Serpell is published by Hogarth (£16.99).
