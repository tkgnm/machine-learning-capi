As many as 20 countries may be involved in bypassing the current sanctions, Ukraine reckons.</p> <p>Ukraine cannot but be nervous that the popular revolt of which Baerbock warned – <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/great-gas-turbine-blame-game/\">before quickly regretting her choice of words</a> – will mean support for the war erodes before a Ukrainian military counteroffensive can bolster it. “In Ukraine Putin fights with missiles and tanks, in Europe he fights with gas prices,” says the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.</p> <p>Andrii Yermak, lead adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is clearly wary of how public opinion may turn and says it would be a mistake to allow the war to drag on into winter. The war has to be settled this year, he believes.</p> <p>He claims, and hopes, the people of Milan and Berlin value the price of freedom in Europe over the price of gas. But even the UK’s rock-solid political support for Ukraine may waver if energy bills hit £500 a month in January. It is an endurance test, in which the two competitors play by different rules. After all, Putin does not have to listen to public opinion; he decides it.</p> <p>All that can be assumed is that Putin will keep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/25/russias-gazprom-to-make-drastic-cut-to-europes-gas-supply-from-wednesday\">turning down the gas taps</a> using various pretexts such as turbine failure in the hope that Europe panics about what lies ahead. Thus on Wednesday the Russian energy group Gazprom cut the flow of gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to about one-fifth of capacity. European gas prices have now risen ninefold in the past year.</p> <p>So in this massive hybrid war, and ahead of the winter crunch point, Europe is preparing its defences on every front in the hope that its storage facilities are stocked ready for the winter. Europe has been scouring the world for alternative energy supplies from countries such as Nigeria, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Iraq. The Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, previously persona non grata, was welcomed at the Élysée on Thursday. In the midst of the fall of his government, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, found time to fly to Tangier, and EU officials went to Lagos to offer to improve security for gas installations. The German economic minister, Robert Habeck, bent the knee in Doha. Diplomacy has become a substratum of energy policy.</p> <p>On the demand side, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter\">agreement by EU states this week to reduce domestic demand voluntarily by as much as 15%</a> on prewar levels is a step forward, even if the deal is full of get-out clauses, and is ultimately down to nation states and sacrifice by individuals in their homes and offices.</p> <p>Solidarity measures are in place, but the room for the ECB to keep raising interest rates is reducing as fears of recession grow.</p> <p>The difficulty is that some European governments are more exposed to Russian intimidation than others. In 2021, a total of 14 countries received more than 50% of their gas from Russia. Germany in particular fears it is a sitting duck, prompting the CDU leader of Saxony, Michael Kretschmer, to warn this week that if a peace settlement is not negotiated, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/worries-over-winter-test-support-germany-russia-sanctions-2022-07-28/\">Germany could become deindustrialised</a>. He may be representing east German views, but everyone is living on their nerves.</p> <p>Germany cannot afford the luxury of debating its past foreign policy mistakes. “In security policy, in our Russia policy, in our energy policy, we are at ground zero and have to start from scratch,” Walter Ischinger, the former German diplomat said on Thursday.</p> <p>Italy, by comparison, is more prepared. The government said this week it would be independent of all Russian gas supply from the second half of 2024, and to get through this winter required only a cut of 7% in current consumption. </p> <p>But if the purpose of sanctions, and consequent pain in Europe, is to cripple Russian revenues, it is not yet working. Oil deliveries in physical terms fell by 13% from May to June, from 18.9m tonnes to 16.5m tonnes, but revenues actually increased a little to €10.5bn (£8.7bn), and are higher than for the same period in 2021.</p> <p>Russian gas exports fell by about a quarter in June compared with last year, but earnings rose to $11.1bn (£9.1bn) compared with $3.6bn.</p> <p>The US has been working on the details of a price cap on Russian oil ever since the G7 in Germany, but the plan still has many hurdles to overcome, not least potential resistance by India and China.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a parallel plan for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/28/global-energy-price-cap-g7-proposal\">unilateral gas price cap</a>, proposed by Mario Draghi, may be fading along with his government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia and now part of an international working group on sanctions, is bullish that they are working, despite a rise in the ruble, lower interest rates, and banks awash with cash. He points out that sanctions on Iran started in 2010 and it took until 2015 for Tehran to be pressured into agreeing a deal on nuclear nonproliferation. He argues that Russia being so active in trying to stop sanctions is the best sign that they are working.</p> <p>There is no shortage of ideas for making the sanctions more effective, including introducing national legislation that permits governments to move from freezing the personal assets of Russian oligarchs to seizing them. This would be facilitated by a global register of what has been frozen. Russia, the group suggests, should be declared a terrorist state, a move that would increase the threat of secondary sanctions by the US. Finally, new laws should be introduced requiring mandatory disclosure of information about any business contacts, joint ownership of corporate rights and property with Russian citizens. A draft of such a resolution has already been submitted to the US Congress. Such measures would force US firms to divest.</p> <p>Proposals are pouring out of the McFaul working group. The pre-eminent issue is the west’s continuing willingness to implement them.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/guy-pearce-was-the-mvp-of-the-neighbours-finale-we-all-just-fell-in-love-with-him-again-right","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T03:45:28Z","webTitle":"Guy Pearce was the ‘MVP of the Neighbours finale’: we all just fell in love with him again, right?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/guy-pearce-was-the-mvp-of-the-neighbours-finale-we-all-just-fell-in-love-with-him-again-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/guy-pearce-was-the-mvp-of-the-neighbours-finale-we-all-just-fell-in-love-with-him-again-right","fields":{"headline":"Guy Pearce was the ‘MVP of the Neighbours finale’: we all just fell in love with him again, right?","trailText":"Gracious, generous and energetically invested in his role, the Hollywood actor stole the last episodes – and invited us to reflect on the passage of time","byline":"Anna Spargo-Ryan","body":"<p>In the opening scene of last night’s Neighbours finale – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/29/neighbours-finale-a-tv-ratings-jackpot-as-ten-farewells-ramsay-street-in-last-episode\">a ratings jackpot for Network 10</a> – Harold Bishop gave voice to what was on all of our minds: “Younger people become older people.

Nostalgia entertainment is like that: it’s an in-joke that rewards the longtime fan who recognises an old character or obscure storyline. That’s why we now have so many reboots, so many sequels and reunion shows. It’s why we still have Rick Astley.</p> <p>That’s mostly what happened in the finale, too. The promised cameos turned out to each be a handful of seconds in a video montage – which, in fairness, is what we expected, and we still went “LANCE!!!” when he came on screen.

He rarely smiles and always sees the worst side of people and places, including our family and home environment. This permanent negativity and dissatisfaction has reached a peak now that he has retired and no longer goes to work. Any attempt to jolly him out of the gloom makes him more abrasive and defensive. I can’t remember when we last had fun together or a good laugh.</strong></p> <p><strong>He has some health issues but mostly the usual ones associated with old age. He had prostate cancer, which resulted in a prostatectomy and impotence. This has been a big blow and various remedies such as Viagra have not worked, so sex has ceased. Bad hips prevent him from playing sports such as golf, bowls or even croquet. I’m in my late </strong><strong>70s and really at my wits’ end on how to address the issue of his unpleasantness without being on the receiving end of a rant about everything that’s wrong with us, the neighbours, the family, the world.</strong></p> <p><strong>Is this depression? He won’t talk to the doctor about it and says he’s not depressed. He has worked hard all his life in engineering/construction and is not a reader. Like a lot of older women I’m desperate for some light relief. What can I do?</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Eleanor says:</strong> </em>The worst part of perpetual grumpiness is how absorbing it can be to the people around it. Either it makes you feel grumpy, too, puncturing your moments of levity and colouring your days grey, or it pushes you to the opposite end of the spectrum – Eeyorishness turning you into a counterbalancing Tigger, bouncing around with cheer-up attempts. “Look, it’s sunny! Look, a balloon!” Either way you’re responding to their grumpiness: it becomes the organising centre of your domestic life.</p> <p>This can be a recipe for resentment. It sounds like you<em> </em>experience your husband as deeply influential over you and your shared home; his bitterness is the mood-setter, the attention-consumer. Asymmetrically, though, it sounds like he may experience himself as profoundly power<em>less</em>. It’s wretched to go through what he has; to be in pain, to not be able to have sex, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/17/old-man-3\">even just to age</a> and feel the best parts of your life might be over.

So why do I find it impossible to get a divorce? | Leading questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I know you’ve talked to him; I know you know I’m going to suggest that you try it again. Does he know how much this is affecting you? Sometimes we can be motivated to change for our loved one’s sake, if not our own. The better angels of his nature might be sorry to hear he felt this miserable all the time, but sadder still to think he was making his life partner feel this way too.</p> <p>It might also be worth getting qualified help for some of what he’s gone through. Cancer, impotence, loss of mobility – there aren’t many of us who’d take these cheerily in stride. But though they’ve ruled him out of some kinds of exercise and intimacy, there are lots of professionals who can help him find new ones. I wonder if you could insist on physical therapy, hydro exercise, finding ways of touching that will bring you closer. There are lots of resources for people of all ages and mobility levels to prevent a sedentary isolation that will only make us feel worse.</p> <p>If you exhaust all the ways of engaging with him, though, there does come a point where the next step is to stop engaging. Years of marriage can make it difficult to remember what it was like to be a separate person, but you are separate from your husband, and your emotional experience can be too.</p> <p>You’re clear about the things you need and aren’t getting: a bit of optimism about the world, a good laugh, some light relief. It’s important that you find ways to have these things, with or without your husband. It could be with friends, in books, in local shows, or simply by taking some time alone outside the house – but you don’t exist to be a bucket for his emotions. If he’s no longer feeling levity in the world, you deserve to find your own.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Ask us a question</h2> <p>Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

Worked in finance earning good money [until] I was 33. Had a baby, wanting to be there for her, didn’t return to my career. Did childminding as a way to earn some income but still be around as “mummy”. Husband still ran his business and his work situation didn’t change at all of course!</p> <p>Split up from husband. Met a new partner, had a second baby at 37. She is disabled and requires [24-hour] care. Had to give up childminding so no income. New partner bailed out, haven’t seen him in years. I care for the second baby (now 9 years old) between 90-120 hours per week.</p> <p>I have no money, no pension, no savings. I rely solely on the state. I am very grateful to have a council-funded roof over my head. But I worry about the future.</p> <p>Eventually my daughter will have to go into a care home. I can’t care for her forever. I will have spent decades providing care for others and saving the government millions by being an at-home carer and I’ll have nothing at the end of it.</p> <p>We joke that I will live in a caravan on my eldest daughter’s driveway.

Thankfully, I am very financially secure due to my husband and my superannuation I accrued in a professional public servant role I had before I had children.

Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, proposed the conversation in June when he met with his Chinese counterpart “as part of our efforts to maintain open lines of communication and manage the relationship responsibly”, Jean-Pierre said.</p> <p>The men agreed to schedule their first in-person summit as leaders, according to US officials, but no detail was given on the timing or location.</p> <p>Taiwan’s foreign ministry said on Friday that it would continue to deepen its close security partnership with the United States.</p> <p>Last week, it was reported that Pelosi was planning a trip to Taiwan, although it has still not been confirmed. Biden cautioned against the trip, and Beijing threatened Washington with serious consequences if it went ahead. A visit by the House speaker would be a dramatic, though not unprecedented, show of US support for the island.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/21/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-trip-not-good-idea-right-now-joe-biden\">Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan trip ‘not a good idea right now’, says Biden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taiwan has complained of increased Chinese military manoeuvres over the past two years to try to force it to accept Beijing’s sovereignty.</p> <p>On Thursday, Taiwan’s military said it fired flares to warn away a drone that “glanced by” a strategically located and heavily fortified island close to the Chinese coast that was possibly investigating its defences. A senior Taiwanese official said it was a Chinese drone, probably one of China’s new CSC-005 drones. China has not commented.</p> <p>In 1997, China complained about the then-speaker Newt Gingrich’s visit to Taiwan, but eventually swallowed its irritation. Analysts worry that as Xi prepares for an extraordinary third term as China’s president later this year, he would not want to be seen as weak in his response to such a move.</p> <p>“If the US insists on going its own way and challenging China’s bottom line, it will surely be met with forceful responses,” said Zhao Lijian, the Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesperson. “All ensuing consequences shall be borne by the US.”</p> <p>Thursday’s call began at 8.33am EDT (1333 BST) and lasted two hours and 17 minutes. China’s spokesperson, Hua Chunying, described the exchange as “candid”. It is the two leaders’ fifth conversation since February 2021, soon after Biden became US president.</p> <p>During the call, Xi said Washington’s definition of Beijing as its primary rival and most serious long-term challenge was “misperceiving China-US relations and misreading China’s development, and would mislead the people of the two countries and the international community”, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1552691179568828416\">according to Hua</a>.</p> <p>Chinese state media said Xi told Biden the US should abide by the “one-China principle” – which the US calls the “one-China policy” – and stressed that China firmly opposed Taiwanese independence and interference of external forces.</p> <p>Yet, although Taiwan has dominated the headlines of late, the leaders also spoke about other issues. Tensions surrounding the South China Sea, for example, were high on the list raised by Biden during the call.</p> <p>The two leaders also discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and bilateral trade, global supply chains, and the ongoing food and energy crises, according to the Chinese statement. Biden previously said he was still considering lifting some of the tariffs on Chinese imports in an attempt to ease the domestic cost of living crisis.</p> <p>No big announcement was made immediately after the call. The US said the two leaders had tasked their teams to follow up on their conversation, in particular to address the climate emergency and health security.</p> <p>The Biden administration has been debating whether to lift some tariffs on Chinese goods as a way to ease soaring inflation, but US officials said a decision was not expected before the call.</p> <p>When Biden last spoke to Xi in March, he warned of “consequences” if Beijing gave material support for Russia’s war, and the US government believes that red line has not been crossed in the months since.</p> <p>As a co-equal branch of government, the US executive has little control over congressional travel. China has grown more powerful militarily and economically since Gingrich’s visit in 1997 and some analysts worry such a trip by Pelosi at a time of fraught ties could spur a crisis across the 100-mile (160km)-wide Taiwan strait.</p> <p>Ali Wyne, a senior analyst at Eurasia Group and the author of America’s Great-Power Opportunity, said the two leaders’ call would at least serve to reinforce the imperative of avoiding miscalculations over Taiwan.</p> <p>He said: “The consequences of a military confrontation between Washington and Beijing would be that much more devastating against the backdrop of a grinding war in eastern Europe and a fragile recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.” </p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/29/new-zealand-climbers-survive-avalanche-and-blizzard-thanks-to-snow-cave-and-muesli-bars","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T00:40:43Z","webTitle":"New Zealand climbers survive avalanche and blizzard, thanks to snow cave and muesli bars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/new-zealand-climbers-survive-avalanche-and-blizzard-thanks-to-snow-cave-and-muesli-bars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/29/new-zealand-climbers-survive-avalanche-and-blizzard-thanks-to-snow-cave-and-muesli-bars","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand climbers survive avalanche and blizzard, thanks to snow cave and muesli bars","trailText":"The two men were at the end of a three-day trip in The Remarkables above Queenstown when they triggered an avalanche","byline":"Eva Corlett in Wellington","body":"<p>Two climbers who were buried by an avalanche and then caught in a blizzard atop one of New Zealand’s most famous mountain ranges survived their ordeal by digging themselves out of the snow, building a cave and living off muesli bars.</p> <p>The two men in their 20s were on a three-day ice climbing adventure in The Remarkables – a 2,300-metre high range above Queenstown – when they triggered an avalanche and were carried about 20 metres downhill.</p> <p>The pair dug themselves out only to discover that the weather was closing in and they would not be able to traverse out of the ranges safely without the risk of triggering another avalanche.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be790af0ecbb35ef12c514f9f96019cf0c764d84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be790af0ecbb35ef12c514f9f96019cf0c764d84/0_0_2400_1846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The boulder where the climbers sheltered, surrounded by snow with three people near it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"769\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The boulder where the climbers dug a snow cave to await rescue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Queenstown Alpine Cliff Rescue Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The men called the police for help at midday on Tuesday, who then requested assistance from the Wakatipu alpine cliff rescue.</p> <p>“It’s very steep and rugged terrain and it is mountainous and snowy … when storms come out it can be a pretty inhospitable place,” said team coordinator Russ Tilsley​.</p> <p>The first two helicopter rescue attempts were thwarted by a blizzard.</p> <p>“It was getting late in the day and we decided it was too late to put a team in on foot … we knew we had a beautiful calm morning the next morning, so we spoke to the guys and they were in good spirits, and they decided to build a snow cave,” Tilsley said​.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/11/british-tourists-survive-avalanche-in-tian-shan-mountains-of-kyrgyzstan\">British tourists survive avalanche in Tian Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The men found a boulder the size of a garage that had built up with snow drift and dug in next to it.

I feel it a lot when I’m out in public. Back when I was starting my rugby sevens career and we were out and about as a team wearing our green-and-gold uniforms, strangers would approach us and ask what sport we played. They generally assumed it was netball or volleyball or waterpolo. When we told them we played rugby, they were surprised and said we didn’t look like rugby players.</p> <p>That really highlighted for me the image around what a female rugby or rugby league player looks like, and the narrative that women don’t play contact sport. Over the years I have witnessed a gradual change in that narrative, a removal of that stigma. And not just in the eyes of strangers, either. In rugby league – the code I play now – we are well looked after, with administration support, excellent facilities and coaching staff and deserving broadcast exposure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/27/nrlw-star-karina-brown-enraged-by-manly-nrl-jersey-debate\">NRLW star Karina Brown ‘enraged’ by Manly NRL jersey debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I suppose another barometer for progress is an acknowledgment that you can’t be what you can’t see. When I was younger my only two female idols were Cathy Freeman and Jana Pittman, and that was because I was also a track-and-field sprinter. Given the paucity of high-profile female league players, though, I looked up to Greg Inglis, Billy Slater and Darren Lockyer.</p> <p>There were female rugby league players around at the time, but they weren’t put in front of the younger generation in any meaningful way, and we didn’t really get to see what they did until I stepped into the professional environment. I know that the majority of the playing group who are around my age and older can attest to that. We all have really similar stories.</p> <p>I also recognise that I am benefiting from the work of players who came before me. I don’t have to raise money or sell my car to fund my own trips to play for Australia or New South Wales. I have a uniform I didn’t have to pay for. I even have a boot sponsor, which is just unreal. Last year, when the NRLW was postponed due to the pandemic, our sponsors helped us navigate those waters financially. That whole support network never existed 10 years ago.</p> <p>It makes a huge difference for an athlete in that it allows us to focus solely on what we’re supposed to do, rather than have all of the burdens and stress that our male counterparts haven’t had to worry about for decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8f30f29f549ece6a2b08f19b0e388142ba82ff7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8f30f29f549ece6a2b08f19b0e388142ba82ff7/0_0_4926_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiana Penitani in action for the Parramatta Eels in an NRLW match against Gold Coas in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiana Penitani in action for the Parramatta Eels in an NRLW match against Gold Coas in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These improvements are really drummed into the elite players of today, because the young players coming through don’t always understand. They walk into a squad and are given their kit, and have come to expect that. And that’s a good thing – we should expect it, and we are sick of having those conversations about how we should just be grateful to be here. We are well beyond that now. I suppose it is more just ensuring that we all have an appreciation of what others have been through to get us to this point, to prevent the younger girls from developing a sense of entitlement that can become a detriment to their careers.</p> <p>And it is important to involve men in these conversations. Some male players are just completely unaware of some of the challenges we face, but I know from experience that once we get them up to speed, the majority put their hand up in support. It can be something as small as sharing something on social media to their often male-dominant follower base, which helps our game gain traction or shifts the narrative. It opens their eyes, because while many of the men have partners at home who help with the kids and support them as professional athletes, some of the girls who have had kids are organising their family and their home and then training and playing on top of that.</p> <p>That’s a big part of why I like dedicated rounds such as the NRL’s women in league round and multicultural round, which is also special to me because have Pacific Island heritage. The women’s round acknowledges every woman involved in rugby league, from the female players, coaches, referees and administrators down to the grassroots and the mums who are cutting up oranges for the under-10s.

The celebrations were still pretty muted, and not just because the Cottagers fans’ genteel reputation precedes them. The club’s last two promotions to the Premier League were followed by immediate relegation, and so finishing 17th or higher would be viewed as a resounding success.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"35f0a27d-3a61-4786-928d-219730429709\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pkI3RopVb2U?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Craven Cottage will have a different look, the towering Riverside Stand finally open for business, though initially only the lower tier, as the owner, Shahid Khan, modernises the chintzy, beloved stadium. High ticket prices to pay for the renovations have become a battleground between fans and Khan.</p> \n<p>The cost can climb as high as £100 for a single match ticket for the opener with Liverpool, asking a great deal of fans when Marco Silva, the manager, has admitted the label of a “yo-yo team” is a “good nickname”. Last season was enjoyable, a breeze back up, but Silva will be without Fabio Carvalho, sold to Liverpool, a main supplier of Aleksandar Mitrovic’s record haul of 43 Championship goals, though Harry Wilson remains.</p> \n<p>It is in neither Silva nor Fulham’s makeup to play percentage football, and that high-paying public have come to expect entertainment. Khan will likely not match the ill-starred £100m of spending of the summer of 2018, and has spoken of needing to “have a different approach than one of the bigger clubs”. The hope is Silva has enough nous and his players can find enough quality to break the cycle of promotion followed by demotion.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/fulham/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>It is only five years since Silva’s arrival at Hull caused consternation in the Sky Soccer Saturday studio, and he is set to manage his fourth Premier League club with his reputation still very much mixed. Each of his spells at Hull, Watford and Everton showed that Silva can be an innovative, organised and attacking coach, only for his team to drop away into inconsistency. Silva himself is not someone given to backslapping the media, usually choosing to keep his own, quiet counsel. Fulham having blasted their way up from the Championship, their manager has just as much to prove as his club when it comes to staying power. To meet his ambitions, he needs to gain a reputation for stability and longevity but is working under an owner in Khan who has never been shy of pressing the button.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87b9988ba5847b1fcfd6e77790b8499a229d543a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87b9988ba5847b1fcfd6e77790b8499a229d543a/0_201_2881_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Summer signing João Palhinha in action during the pre-season friendly against Benfica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Summer signing João Palhinha in action during the pre-season friendly against Benfica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Pozo/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Fulham’s summer transfer activity has not been brisk but in signing a defensive midfielder in João Palhinha from Silva’s native Portugal, at least some of their soft underbelly may have been protected. Palhinha, as a leading light in a Sporting Lisbon team that won a first title in 19 years, has a reputation as an enforcer, with the powerful physique and classic tactical awareness of a Portuguese midfielder. A close relationship with Rúben Amorim, who had coached him on loan at Braga, revived his career at Sporting. Fulham paid £18m for a player previously linked with the Portuguese enclave at Wolves.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>With a squad not laden with players likely to be jetting off, the timing of the World Cup could be useful in Fulham’s expected battle for safety, though Palhinha seems set to be involved with Portugal. Tim Ream, the veteran US defender, played only one international match last season, and may miss out on Qatar. Fulham’s pre-tournament fixtures are not kind; they sign off for the break with matches against Manchester City and Manchester United.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:33:25/embed.html\" data-alt=\"l\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:33:25/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>Take a wintry stroll through Bishops Park, sip expensive coffee, take in Putney’s throbbing nightlife, including a few pints in the Spotted Horse, watch the rowers fly down the Thames, and various other bourgeois pursuits on offer in the comfortable surroundings of SW6.</p> \n<h2>Leading the shirt sales</h2> \n<p>In blowing away Guy Whittingham’s 29-year-old Championship scoring record, Mitrovic confirmed his cult reputation. Silva’s demand that he keep fit over last summer clearly paid high dividends. “He didn’t have any paunch on him or anything,” said an admiring Khan, who has termed Mitro a “legend”. Like his club, Mitrovic has the reputation of being too good for the Championship yet short of Premier League quality, though he seems to have a better relationship with Silva than predecessor Scott Parker, with whom he fell out during the club’s last Premier League season.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>Fulham’s players are pretty well behaved on the socials, but central defender Tosin Adarabioyo likes to share a bit of himself across Twitter and Instagram, and is making tentative steps into TikTok. He shares bespoke artwork that resembles 1990s rap album covers, including the time-honoured “Parental Guidance” label and cigars, and pays regular tribute to Nigerian megastar Burna Boy. There’s also some pointed football business retweets, including some NFT content, but he also marks himself out as a big team player, and particularly as a fan of “Mitro” at “only 27 years young”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed–overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed–the-fiver\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>If Fulham were a Netflix dox …</h2> \n<p>We’d see Shahid Khan and son Tony very much to the fore, their NFL ownership teaching them the value of camera time and big-boy talk.

After 2016’s astonishing visual album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/01/beyonce-lemonade-visual-album-review-woman-scorned\">Lemonade</a>, the pop behemoth put out a solid but canonically forgettable collaborative full-length with husband Jay-Z (as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/17/the-carters-everything-is-love-review-beyonce-jay-z\">the Carters</a>), plus 2019’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/19/beyonce-the-lion-king-the-gift-review-superstar-shows-impeccable-taste\">The Gift</a>, her vibrant soundtrack for Disney’s remake of The Lion King. The protracted wait for her seventh album gives its title, Renaissance, a multiplicity of meanings, nodding to Beyoncé’s return and also society’s post-pandemic rejuvenation. <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a37039502/beyonce-evolution-interview-2021/\">As she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2021</a>: “With all the isolation and injustice over the past year, I think we are all ready to escape, travel, love and laugh again.

Lead single <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/21/beyonce-break-my-soul-review-a-far-cry-from-crazy-in-love-renaissance\">Break My Soul</a> was a boisterous and euphoric slice of 90s diva house, albeit not exactly groundbreaking. Still, her first US Top 10 single in six years also marked her return to US radio airplay, so clearly it did something right. But Renaissance, for the most part, ventures beyond pastiche into far more eclectic, adventurous territory – a fine soundtrack for a feral summer of chaos and joy. Fast-paced bounce melds with glossy Diana Ross-inspired disco, tinges of soul, sweltering Afrobeats and gqom; swirling trap, swaggering house, Jersey Club, New Jack Swing and even gritty, thumping maximalism (courtesy of PC Music’s AG Cook) on All Up in Your Mind – often within the space of one song. The songs flow as a continuous mix, with beat-switches reigning supreme: Energy starts in the same funky bass arena as the preceding Cuff It before spinning into nocturnal global house hedonism with Jamaican-American rapper Beam; Church Girl goes from gilded gospel to thot rap; Pure/Honey’s brash self-confidence suddenly yields to breezy pop vocal harmonies.</p> <p>Sometimes these daring clashes are head-scratching: Alien Superstar interpolates Right Said Fred’s I’m Too Sexy and just about gets away with it precisely because it doesn’t hang around too long: gliding strings and breathy singing beget rapping over thumping bass; then cosmic glitching, twanging guitars and expansive harmonies about supernatural love. At others, they don’t quite live up to the sum of their parts. It was intoxicating when Beyoncé riffed on Donna Summer’s Love to Love You Baby on 2004’s Naughty Girl; here, it feels decadent to hear her crooning the chorus to I Feel Love on Summer Renaissance – as irresistible as that magic Giorgio Moroder riff remains – though perhaps decadence is the point.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjki-9Pthh0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yjki-9Pthh0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Beyoncé: Break My Soul</figcaption> </figure>   <p>That uninhibited, playful approach to genre is mirrored in Beyoncé urging listeners to wholeheartedly embrace pleasure: there are “church girls acting loose”; the lush, raunchy glitter of Virgo’s Groove decorated with Beyoncé ordering her man to “taste me / that fleshy part / I scream so loud”; the carnal breathiness of Thique (“he thought he was loving me good / I told him go harder”). Cuff It subverts a classically sugary Nile Rodgers bass line with her wayward, self-deprecating desire to “fuck something up”. Personal satisfaction is paramount: “We don’t need the world’s acceptance, they’re too hard on me / They’re too hard on you, boy,” she sings on the glowing neo-soul of Plastic Off the Sofa, seemingly in reference to never-ending public speculation about her marriage to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jayz\">Jay-Z</a>. As with Drake’s club-centric Honestly, Nevermind (he’s here too, albeit imperceptibly, on Heated), Beyoncé has swapped the concrete storytelling of her 2013 self-titled album and Lemonade for pure vibes: vague aphorisms about self-actualisation, sex and love underpinning the loose philosophy of her own hot girl summer. She sells it (certainly better than Drake) thanks to her convincing vocal power: beautifully melismatic on Virgo’s Groove, commanding on Move, channelling her Houston roots in quick-fire bars on the ferocious, exhilarating breakdown on Heated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/28/beyonce-returns-with-renaissance-a-play-for-the-mainstream-and-a-strike-against-perfectionism\">Beyoncé returns with Renaissance: a play for the mainstream and a strike against perfectionism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The increasingly politicised nature of Beyoncé’s work over the past decade has established certain expectations for this album. Break My Soul’s lyrics encouraging listeners to “release ya job” resonated with the sentiment of the great resignation; when she shared Renaissance’s tracklist prior to release, many assumed that America Has a Problem would offer a fairly literal exposition of its title. But it turns out to be named after the Atlanta rap track it samples, subverting Kilo Ali’s lyrics about cocaine to use drugs as a (not terribly imaginative) allegory for love. As with Kendrick Lamar’s Mr Morale and the Big Steppers, there’s a sense of Beyoncé refusing the mantle that culture has placed on her as a perfectionist and spokesperson. Where initially many people were baffled by the anticapitalist sentiment of Break My Soul given Beyoncé’s evidently very commercial enterprise, her claim that she “just quit my job” finds context here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6FJxoadUE4JNVwWHghBwnb?si=KtXDoFBYTHSr3mznr9tEkA\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6FJxoadUE4JNVwWHghBwnb?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Although there are sharp lines such as “them Karens just turned into terrorists” and musings on how Beyoncé embodies “this un-American life”, for the most part Renaissance finds its politics in Black joy. In another echo of its title, it also affirms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/25/house-music-black-drake-beyonce-white-fans\">the Black roots of club culture</a>, referencing New Orleans bounce pioneers and featuring production from creators such as the Black, transgender DJ and producer Honey Dijon. There are frequent nods to ballroom, the resourceful underground communities that gave queer people chosen families and a refuge for celebration. She samples 90s drag artist Moi Renee, categorises herself as a “bad bitch” on Alien Superstar, and steps into an affectedly poised, staccato delivery on Pure/Honey. It’s knowingly done – her instruction “get your money money, cunty hunty” just about skirts caricature for humour. There are perhaps questions to ask about a wealthy, cis, straight woman embodying this culture, although it’s a homage to her mother’s brother – her “godmother and the first person to expose me to a lot of the music and culture that serve as inspiration for this album”, <a href=\"https://beyonce.com/uploads/2022/07/red-image-text.jpg\">she said</a> – who died of an Aids-related illness: “Uncle Johnny made my dress / ‘That cheap Spandex / She look a mess’,” she sings on Heated, reclaiming a criticism as a point of pride.</p> <p>Touted as Act I of a confirmed trilogy, Renaissance falls short of being Beyoncé’s best full-length, but it still fulfils her liberationist aims. It’s a celebration of living abundantly and outside the realms of others’ expectations, and acts as a reminder of how rare it is to witness this hyper-disciplined artist simply having fun on her own terms. Her sense of freedom throughout is palpable, and an infectious spur to action.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2022/jul/29/genetic-heart-conditions-could-be-cured-first-time-defining-moment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T23:01:39Z","webTitle":"Genetic heart conditions could be cured for first time in ‘defining moment’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/29/genetic-heart-conditions-could-be-cured-first-time-defining-moment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jul/29/genetic-heart-conditions-could-be-cured-first-time-defining-moment","fields":{"headline":"Genetic heart conditions could be cured for first time in ‘defining moment’","trailText":"Team of experts from UK, US and Singapore to design jab to save thousands of lives by rewriting DNA","byline":"Andrew Gregory Health editor","body":"<p>Scientists are to develop the world’s first cure for genetic heart conditions by rewriting DNA in a move hailed as a “defining moment” for cardiovascular medicine.</p> <p>A global team of experts from the UK, US and Singapore are joining forces to design a jab in the arm for patients to save thousands of lives after being awarded a £30m grant from the British Heart Foundation.</p> <p>The team will use precision genetic techniques, called base and prime editing, in the heart for the first time to design and test the first cure for inherited heart muscle diseases, with the aim of silencing faulty genes.

Instagram said on Thursday it was rolling back some of the changes including a test version of the app that gave a full-screen display to posts.</p> <p>It will also tone down changes to its algorithm that resulted in users’ feeds being deluged with videos from accounts they do not follow.</p> <p>“I’m glad we took a risk – if we’re not failing every once in a while, we’re not thinking big enough or bold enough,” said Instagram’s head, Adam Mosseri, in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/28/23282682/instagram-rollback-tiktok-feed-recommendations-interview-adam-mosseri\">tech newsletter Platformer</a>. “But we definitely need to take a big step back and regroup. [When] we’ve learned a lot, then we come back with some sort of new idea or iteration. So we’re going to work through that.”</p> <p>Rumblings among some of Instagram’s more than 1 billion users came to a head on Monday when Jenner, the app’s third most followed user with 361 million followers joined her sister Kim Kardashian, the seventh biggest with 326 million, in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CgVLB1Dj3Ow/\">sharing a meme</a> that demanded “Make Instagram Instagram Again.” The meme added: “stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.”</p> <p>People who used the platform to interact with friends and family also complained that their feeds had been flooded with unwanted videos. The backlash prompted Mosseri to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CgeQ5DqgSyv/\">post a video on Tuesday</a> – which he said was recorded before he saw the Kardashian posts – in which he said “more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time”. But by Thursday he had conceded that Instagram had gone too far.</p> <p>“For the new feed designs, people are frustrated and the usage data isn’t great,” he told Platformer. “So there I think that we need to take a big step back, regroup, and figure out how we want to move forward.”</p> <p>Mosseri added that Instagram would reduce the amount of recommended posts after users complained about being pushed content from accounts they do not follow. “When you discover something in your field that you didn’t follow before, there should be a high bar – it should just be great,” Mosseri said. “You should be delighted to see it. And I don’t think that’s happening enough right now.

The overall aim would be to double the numbers deported.</p> <p>Sunak said the UK was “far too soft on foreigners who commit crime in our country<em>”.</em></p> <p>In a separate element of his crime strategy, Sunak said any offenders deemed to be career criminals would have an automatic extra year of jail added to their term for a new offence.</p> <p>The proposals are the latest in a series of policy ideas on immigration and asylum from Sunak and Truss, who have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/24/rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss-vow-dramatic-expansion-of-rwanda-asylum-scheme\">condemned</a> by Amnesty International and others for “cruelty and immorality”.</p> <p>Truss, the foreign secretary, has pledged to expand the controversial policy begun by Boris Johnson under which even legitimate asylum seekers can be deported permanently to Rwanda, and has said she would seek similar deals with other countries.</p> <p>Sunak has similarly backed an expansion of the Rwanda policy, and at one point last week proposed housing people who arrive illegally in cruise ships instead of hotels, despite concerns that this could amount to arbitrary detention and thus breach domestic and international law.</p> <p>The idea of halving the sentence threshold for deporting overseas offenders has been considered by the Home Office under Priti Patel, but has not been taken forward in part because it was felt those jailed for relatively minor offences would often be able to thwart deportation under human rights laws.</p> <p>Such deportations are often challenged under the existing system, with campaigners expressing concern at the number of people removed who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/most-jamaicans-facing-deportation-flight-came-uk-children-study\">came to the UK as children</a> or young people.</p> <p>Campaigners have also said people from Caribbean countries such as Jamaica seem to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/25/disproportionate-targeting-of-jamaicans-for-deportation-from-uk-data-suggests\">disproportionately targeted</a> for deportation if they commit crimes, compared with people of some other nationalities.</p> <p>Sunak has pledged to support a Johnson government plan for a UK bill of rights, which would seek to loosen the influence of the European court of human rights (ECHR) on how the law is applied.</p> <p>Truss has indicated she could completely remove the UK from the ECHR, and her campaign said that without action to speed up deportation, Sunak’s plan would simply add to the numbers awaiting removal.</p> <p>“This thin announcement is a desperate gimmick that contains no proposals that will actually double the number of deportations, it just adds to the number in the queue,” said Chris Philp, an MP backing Truss who was formerly an immigration minister under Johnson.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: “Removing foreign national offenders is a priority for this government and since January 2019, despite the challenges of the pandemic, we have removed 10,741 foreign criminals. </p> <p> “The pool of people eligible for removal is not the barrier to returns, it is the merry-go-round legal challenges that individuals and their legal representatives use which requires systemic change. That is why our Nationality and Borders Act makes it harder for those who try to enter last-minute claims as a delay tactic to frustrate removals.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/28/vincent-kompany-wants-burnley-to-fly-high-but-happy-to-play-long-game","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T21:30:38Z","webTitle":"Vincent Kompany wants Burnley to fly high but happy to play long game","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/vincent-kompany-wants-burnley-to-fly-high-but-happy-to-play-long-game","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/28/vincent-kompany-wants-burnley-to-fly-high-but-happy-to-play-long-game","fields":{"headline":"Vincent Kompany wants Burnley to fly high but happy to play long game","trailText":"New manager insists Championship club are ‘not a parachute team’ as he balances big name departures with ‘smart’ signings","byline":"Andy Hunter","body":"<p>A new reality as well as a new season opens for Burnley on Friday. A new manager with a new style and a radically different squad from the one that was a Premier League fixture for six seasons under Sean Dyche makes his Championship bow at Huddersfield, and Vincent Kompany is acutely aware the financial landscape has changed for his club along with their surroundings.</p> <p>“We are not a parachute team,” says the Manchester City legend and former Anderlecht head coach before the Championship opener. “You don’t have to be to be successful.” But Kompany is making no guarantees over an immediate return to the top flight for a club who have lost a host of key players, and had to repay a significant portion of a £65m loan taken out as part of ALK Capital’s takeover, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/burnley-suffer-relegation-after-callum-wilson-leads-newcastle-to-victory\" title=\"\">relegation in May</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/18/vincent-kompany-burnley-england-return-anderlecht\">Vincent Kompany has chosen a tricky task at Burnley on return to England | Will Unwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burnley’s high-profile yet down-to-earth manager explains his parachute theory as follows. “It means we’ve got to make sure we have to jump from a little bit of a lesser height,” he says of Burnley’s financial outlay ahead of the new campaign. “The problem is if you jump without a parachute and people are saying: ‘Do it now [win promotion], do it now.’</p> <p>“There’s a great buzz around the place if that happens but every big team who has come down and kept plummeting has made that gamble. I can’t undo what’s happened. All I can do is come in and see what the solution is going forward – and the solution is to make sure that the fall is not from too high.</p> <p>“We have to make sure those players on the pitch grow in value or grow to get the team back in the Premier League.”</p> <p>Kompany mentions “value” regularly, in terms of maximising and losing it. Sixteen players have left since the end of last season but only three brought in a fee, the England goalkeeper Nick Pope, Nathan Collins and Dwight McNeil – the latter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/everton-close-in-on-20m-deal-for-burnley-winger-dwight-mcneil\" title=\"\">joined Everton yesterday</a> for a fee that could reach £20m – although that should increase with Maxwel Cornet also expected to leave. Too many players reached the end of their contracts at the same time. Thursday’s signing of the Brazilian defender Vitinho from Cercle Brugge made it nine incomings, all for modest fees, as loans or free in the case of CJ Egan-Riley.</p> <p>“I think you have seen it happening through the transfer window – clubs going down, big wages and expensive players coming in with no resale value, then you know something is happening,” Kompany says. “Those are not the types of deals we’ve done. We’ve done deals where we’ve tried to be smart. You can’t fault us for trying. We try to do deals where we are not exposed to the downsides if it [promotion this season] doesn’t happen. If it works then we are buzzing but if not we get the chance to go again.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a701190d6202dd3658b53c42d25e435d6b6ea06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a701190d6202dd3658b53c42d25e435d6b6ea06/222_166_1845_1107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vincent Kompany looks on during his Burnley side’s 3-0 pre-season defeat by Wolves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vincent Kompany looks on during his Burnley side’s 3-0 pre-season defeat by Wolves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Thomas/WWFC/Wolves/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 36-year-old insists he was on board with Burnley’s long-term plan and financial reality when returning to the north-west from Belgium in June. “I’ve signed a long-term contract of four to five years,” he says. “That was one of the big selling points for me to come here.

Anyone who knows me, or just sees me playing in a staff game, knows how competitive I am in everything I do, but I am not delusional. I try to stay methodical as well.”</p> <p>Kompany has used his City contacts to sign three players from his former club – Egan-Riley, the goalkeeper Arijanet Muric for an undisclosed fee and the highly-rated Taylor Harwood-Bellis on loan – and first-hand experience of Belgium football to land Vitinho, Samuel Bastien and Josh Cullen.</p> <p>“If you look at the background of most players you will probably see City or United or Liverpool or Arsenal,” he says. “There’s not many players in world football who have not been under contract at these clubs. Once you go down to the Championship it becomes even more important to work with the big clubs in the north-west and see if we can benefit from that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“At this moment it helps us, but the ambition is to be completely independent and self-sufficient.

The company has struggled with Covid shutdowns at factories in China and a computer chip shortage.</p> <p>Apple has managed to maintain greater stability than other tech giants that have announced hiring slowdowns and layoffs. But the company does plan to slow hiring and spending next year in an effort to be more cautious as an expected recession looms, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-18/apple-to-slow-hiring-and-spending-for-some-teams-next-year?sref=fqqmZ8gi\">Bloomberg reported</a> this month.</p> <p>“Apple’s move reflects a broader slowdown in investing in new things, new companies and new products,” Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, told Reuters. “It signifies that inflation is an issue for these companies.”</p> <p>Google, Microsoft and Meta have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/19/apple-slow-hiring-spending-inflation\">announced plans</a> to slow hiring or cut jobs.

For all her weirdness, Truss charmed the audience most – imagine that","byline":"John Crace","body":"<p>Welcome back my friends to the Show that Never Ends. The Tory leadership contest is only just in its third week but it already feels interminable. Timeless even. As if it’s almost impossible to imagine life without it. First we had a series of unedifying debates in which Liz Truss and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a> – with occasional contributions from three other, long-since archived, contenders – picked fights and traded fantasies with one another.</p> <p>Now we have entered a fresh circle of hell. Twelve hustings where Radon Liz and Rish! each face an hour’s worth of questions from party members, one after the other. So we don’t even get the pleasure of seeing them disagree with each other. Rather they do battle to feed the delusions of the 160,000 or so Tory members who are the only voters that count for this particular election with ever more far-fetched rightwing policies. If you can call them that.</p> <p>We began with an event hosted by LBC’s Nick Ferrari in front of an audience of 1,400 at the Centenary Pavilion, opposite the football ground in Leeds. Not more than a long stone’s throw from the Roundhay school where Truss grew up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/shes-delusional-roundhay-voters-on-tory-leadership-contender-liz-truss\">grinding middle-class poverty.</a> Fed on a diet of beetroot quiche. It’s a wonder she can now read and write. Let alone that the school failed her so badly she went on to do PPE at Oxford.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/shes-delusional-roundhay-voters-on-tory-leadership-contender-liz-truss\">‘She’s delusional’: Roundhay voters on Tory leadership contender Liz Truss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just like Rish! Fancy that. His only connection with Leeds is that his constituency is in the same county. So he knows all about the hassle of trying to get planning permission for a tennis court, swimming pool and gym. Just one of the hardships of being worth three-quarters of a billion. He feels the country’s pain.</p> <p>Or not. It was Rish! who won the coin toss and got to go first in making his 10 minute opening pitch from a platform in the centre of the auditorium. He did so without notes, but came across like an empty vessel. Davos man, full of slick superficiality. Completely oblivious to the fact he had been in government and was responsible for the dire straits in which the country found itself.</p> <p>“I’m having the time of my life,” Sunak began. Well, that’s nice. Because millions of people are struggling with the cost of living and using food banks. But as long as Rish! was having a good time, all was well. He went on to make a joke about his skin colour that died on its feet. Thank you and good night. He’ll be here all week. Sadly for us he’ll be here for the next five weeks. Though that gag should be dumped from his next eleven gigs.</p> <p>We then got the imaginary backstory about how his parents hadn’t had two Mogadon to rub together at their Southampton pharmacy. But he loved this country for what it had given him. Which is why he wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/24/rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss-vow-dramatic-expansion-of-rwanda-asylum-scheme\">stop other refugees getting here</a>. Rish! had done his homework on the priorities of the Tory members. He ended by talking about honesty – he couldn’t explain why it had taken him so long to realise that Boris Johnson was pathologically unable to tell the truth – and the need to rebuild the economy and reunite the country. He said this with no sense of irony. Or responsibility. Time and again he paused for applause that never came.</p> <p>Radon Liz also spoke spontaneously without a script. Or as spontaneous as a late 90s computer with obsolete software can manage. Often she seemed to stop mid-sentence. Not because she couldn’t remember how it was meant to end: but because she seemed to think she had already finished. It made for a staccato 10 minutes. Not that the audience seemed to mind as Truss did a whirlwind tour of name checks. Her time as a local councillor. Northern powerhouse rail. Don Revie. Standing up to Putin. Anti-wokery. All got applause. She may be awkward but she had done her homework.</p> <p>After a short interval, Rish! reappeared. This time to be interviewed for 15 minutes by Ferrari and the audience. The LBC presenter didn’t pull his punches, but Sunak was well prepped. Up to a point. His panicked U-turn promise to reduce VAT on fuel bills that was un-Conservative last week was now a well-considered, time-limited policy. Hmm.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher would have done exactly what he was doing. They might as well be soul siblings. Hmm. He hadn’t stabbed Boris in the back. He had been totally cool about Boris lying about parties and ignoring allegations of sexual assault, he had just had a difference of opinion on the direction of the economy. Hmm. He even voiced his enthusiasm for grammar schools. Yes, it was that bad. The applause was almost audible at times.</p> <p>Things didn’t much improve when Truss got her turn under the spotlight. She claimed that she was public enemy No 1 of President Putin – apparently she is the most feared woman in the world – and she too insisted she was a blood sister of Maggie. After that, everyone seemed to tune out rather. It was all just a wee bit flat. Dull, even. But for all her weirdness, Radon Liz was the one who charmed the audience most. Imagine that.</p> <p>Rish! must be in despair. The boy with the golden touch to whom life has effortlessly bestowed anything on which he sets his heart, is going to be denied. The Tory members have spoken and they just don’t like him or trust him enough. And the rest of us will be lumbered with Radon Liz as prime minister. There is no coming back from the hubristic road to perdition. We can only forget our patriotism and succumb to satire. Sit back and enjoy the ride.

And a government doesn’t go on picket lines, a government tries to resolve disputes.”</p> \n  <p>But in the late 1970s, when Labour was in government, government ministers did join picket lines, at the Grunwick dispute, <strong>John McDonnell</strong>, the former shadow chancellor, writes in an article for the Guardian. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I went with our CLP delegation regularly. It was a tough and, at times, violent dispute as the police escorted a bus full of scabs brought in by the company to break the strike and teach the women a lesson.</p> \n   <p>The Labour and trade union movement came together as one to campaign against the exploitation of these women. Joining the picket lines to show solidarity were some of the most prominent members of the movement, and among those who joined the women’s picket line were Labour cabinet ministers. Not shadow ministers but cabinet ministers actually serving in government at the time, including, famously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/28/past.politics4\">Shirley Williams</a>.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McDonnell says Starmer’s decision to ban frontbencher from joining picket lines is “a complete misreading of the mood within the Labour and trade union movement but also among the general public”. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In terms of the general public, the reason that there is an unprecedented level of sympathy for these strikes is not just down to the impressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/23/mick-lynch-media-star-labour-rmt-leader-union-boss\">straight-talking eloquence</a> of the RMT’s Mick Lynch. It’s because millions are being hit by the same cost of living crisis, which has become the key mobilising factor in the massive wave of industrial disputes that is currently building.</p> \n   <p>The risk is that when the millions involved go to the polls next, they will be asking the question of the Labour leader, where were you when we needed you? Whatever diktats from the Labour leader’s office, there is a weightier responsibility on the shoulders of Labour members, whatever position they hold. It is to stand up for one another in the Labour and trade union movement in this summer of solidarity.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You can read the full McDonnell article here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/labour-party-cost-of-living-keir-starmer-striking-workers\">What has happened to the Labour party that it can't stand up for labour? | John McDonnell</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T10:22:05.261Z\">at 11.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e253558f08844df997e75a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T09:56:28.744Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Truss suggests she might reconsider government plan to privatise Channel 4</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here are some more lines from what<strong> Liz Truss </strong>has been saying to reporters on her visit in Leeds.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Truss hinted that she might reconsider government plans to privatise Channel 4.</strong> Asked if she would go ahead with the privatisation as PM, she replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I believe that, where possible, it’s best to have companies operating in the private sector rather than the public sector.</p> \n   <p>I will look in detail at the business case on Channel 4, but one thing I’m absolutely committed to is it staying in Leeds.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rishi Sunak, Truss’s rival for the Tory leadership, has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/22/rishi-sunak-vows-to-press-ahead-with-channel-4-privatisation\">he would definitely go ahead with the privatisation.</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said she would not commit to restoring plans for HS2 to go to Leeds</strong>.

This is just one of several areas where the IfG thinks the department’s performance could improve.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Institute has argued that the war in Ukraine requires the UK, and democratic nations more generally, to review its approach to Russia. But this is hindered by the relatively small team dedicated to it. This is not new; as many interviewees for this paper noted, and observers have commented publicly, after the Cold War there was a ‘moment of hope’ and a belief that the worst of the Russian threat had passed. Diplomatic expertise on the countries of the former Soviet Union was reduced. Ambitious members of the Foreign Office specialised in other fields, such as the Middle East and China. This decline in expertise on Russia and its neighbours was noted in 2014 after Russia’s invasion of Crimea by Sir Nigel Sheinwald, former UK ambassador to Moscow, who said: “When the [Crimea] crisis happened, there was a problem in the Foreign Office; the old Cold War cadre of people just wasn’t there.”</p> \n   <p>By 2016 the comparative lack of resources dedicated to Russia was well-established. Between 2016 and 2022, the Eastern Europe and Central Asia unit was consistently among the worst resourced of the geographical units in the FCO and then FCDO. The number of UKB staff at the embassy in Moscow has also been slowly reduced; exact numbers are not available for recent years, but staff numbers fell from 30 in 2016/17 to somewhere in the 20s in 2020/21.</p> \n   <p>Other elements of the Foreign Office’s Russian expertise have continued to be downgraded. Despite the Foreign Affairs Committee drawing attention to Russian language proficiency as a ‘weak spot’ in 2015, the number of staff in the department who could speak it at ‘advanced’ level dropped from 83 in December 2017 to below 60 in February 2022.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e254108f08844df997e774\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T09:18:53.207Z\">10.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">More than 100,000 people fleeing war in Ukraine have arrived in UK under visa schemes, Home Office says</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine have received sanctuary in the UK through its visa schemes, PA Media reports.

Tonight Liz Truss will compete with Rishi Sunak at the first of <a href=\"https://www.conservatives.com/hustings\">the official hustings</a> being organised by the Conservative party for members. <strong>Nadine Dorries</strong>, the culture secretary and Truss supporter, has been on the broadcast round this morning and, despite reportedly being told by Truss’s team <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/liz-truss-nadine-dorries-public-attacks-rishi-sunak-1762897\">to tone down her comments about Sunak</a>, she has found it hard to resist, and her interviews have included various studs up attacks on the former chancellor. On LBC she accused him of “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-debate-aggressive-style-mansplaining\">mansplaining</a>” in the BBC debate on Monday, and said it was a “terrrible look”. And on BBC Breadkfast she defended her decision to have a go at him over his expensive clothes, saying “it’s about judgment, and it’s about who voters can relate to”.</p> \n  <p>But the Labour party is going through a bout of internal fighting too, triggered by Keir Starmer’s decision last night to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer\">sack Sam Tarry as shadow transport minister</a> after he joined an RMT picket line (defying orders from Starmer) and then proceeded to give a series of interviews that had not been authorised by the leadership and in which he flatly contradicted party policy on public sector pay (the real reason why he was sacked, Labour says). My colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot </strong>has all the details here.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer\">Shadow ministers question Labour’s stance on strikes after Tarry sacking</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>As Jess reports, union leaders have criticised Starmer’s move, arguing that it shows Labour is not committed to standing up for working people. This morning leftwingers in the parliamentary party have also accused Starmer of double standards, saying that Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, also gave an interview this week in which she departed form party policy, but that she was not sacked. Reeves said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jul/25/conservative-leadership-contest-keir-starmer-economic-growth-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-62de6e438f08d0ef4fa8e6ae#block-62de6e438f08d0ef4fa8e6ae\">Labour was opposed to rail renationalisation</a>, but later the party said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jul/25/conservative-leadership-contest-keir-starmer-economic-growth-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-62de9e798f08d0ef4fa8e936#block-62de9e798f08d0ef4fa8e936\">that remained its policy.</a></p> \n  <p><strong>John McDonnell</strong>, shadow chancellor when Jeremy Corbyn was leader, told Sky News:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Rachel Reeves went on an interview and made up policy on rail nationalisation which had to be contradicted by the shadow spokesperson on transport within hours. I didn’t see Rachel Reeves being sacked. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Diane Abbott</strong>, shadow home secretary under Corbyn, made the same argument in an interview on the Today programme.</p> \n  <p><strong>McDonnell </strong>also told Sky News that Starmer had generated a “completely unnecessary row”. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just at a time when the Tories are tearing themselves apart, and we’ve got the maximum opportunity, I think, to gain an advantage in the polls that will build the support to take us into a government, we’re having this completely unnecessary row.</p> \n   <p>Sam went on the picket lines like shadow minister after shadow minister over the years in support of workers who are asking for a decent pay rise. It’s a just cause ...</p> \n   <p>The Tory leadership election is demonstrating how the Tories are ripping themselves apart. This is the time where we should have maximum unity and maximum solidarity for the support for workers who are desperate to have a decent pay rise because they’ve been impacted upon so badly by this cost of living crisis.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Tory hustings does not start until 7pm this evening.

The news came as Democrats celebrated a breakthrough on the president’s long-stalled economic agenda after Senator Joe Manchin announced his support for a version of the plan in a shock reversal for the West Virginia holdout.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/joe-biden-climate-deal-senate\">Joe Biden hails Senate deal as ‘most significant’ US climate legislation ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With control of Congress in the balance, Republicans seized on the turn of events to accuse Democrats of deepening economic disarray with their spending plans. Widespread pessimism about the state of the economy has shaped up to be Biden’s biggest political vulnerability, weighing down his approval ratings and threatening Democrats’ chances in November.</p> <p>Moments after the Bureau of Economic Analysis published the highly anticipated GDP report on Thursday morning, Republicans declared the economy well into the throes of “Joe Biden’s recession” and blamed Democrats’ policy initiatives for making life costlier for Americans.</p> <p>“Biden and Democrats are responsible for our shrinking economy, and they’re only trying to make it worse,” said Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.</p> <p>GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, fell by an annual rate of 0.09%, following a 1.6% annual decline in the first three months of the year, according to the commerce department. The numbers recorded two consecutive quarters of declining economic output, a common – but not official – definition of recession.</p> <p>On Thursday, Biden dismissed fears that the US was in a recession, arguing that the economy was “on the right path”.</p> <p>“There’s going to be a lot of chatter today on Wall Street and among pundits about whether we are in a recession,” Biden said on Thursday afternoon. “But if you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment, we see signs of economic progress in the second quarter as well.”</p> <p>In anticipation of the report, the White House has sought to convince Americans that two quarters of economic decline does not necessarily mean the US is in recession, particularly because unemployment remains low, job growth robust and household savings elevated.</p> <p>Biden stressed those sources of strength in the economy during an earlier appearance on Thursday, concluding: “That doesn’t sound like a recession to me.”</p> <p>The president also urged Congress to move quickly to pass his economic agenda that the White House argues will help ease the financial burden on American households by lowering the costs of healthcare and prescription drugs.</p> <p>Biden did pause to take a victory lap on Thursday, interrupting his meeting with the CEOs of five US businesses to announce that the House had enough votes to pass a sprawling bipartisan package designed to strengthen American manufacturing and increase the US’s competitiveness against China.</p> <p>The bill, which next goes to his desk for signatures, will “make cars cheaper, appliances cheaper, and computers cheaper”, Biden said in a statement. “It will lower the costs of every day goods.”</p> <p>But Republicans said the Democrats’ climate, healthcare and tax plan, formerly known as “Build Back Better” and recast as the “Inflation Reduction Act”, would only cause further financial hardship, especially after they passed a $1.9tn coronavirus relief package last year.</p> <p>“The definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results,” the Republican congressman Vern Gale Buchanan of Florida <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vernbuchanan/status/1552641103156895744?s=21&amp;t=7PqXuxN2Frb0oJoNk9VTTA\">wrote</a> on Twitter. “Yet here we are now entering a recession and Democrats are trying to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on Green New Deal priorities and raise taxes on America’s job creators.”</p> <p>Soaring inflation – now running at 40-year highs – led the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to increase interest rates in an effort to bring down prices, the second such increase in just over a month.</p> <p>Labelling the downturn a recession may be more politically charged than economically precise. Recessions are officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private research group, and usually only after the decline is over.</p> <p>“Bottom Line,” Diane Swonk, chief economist for KPMG, said on Twitter, “We are not in a recession – yet. But the current environment is [not] healthy. The cure will be painful but is necessary to avoid an even worse outcome. Rock &amp; hard spot. Scars likely. Hard.”</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said the US economy is in a state of transition, from a period of fast-paced growth to a period of more sustainable growth.</p> <p>Recession, she explained, is generally viewed as a “broad-based weakening of our economy” that includes “substantial job losses and mass layoffs, businesses shutting down, private sector activities slowing considerably”.</p> <p>“That is not what we are seeing right now,” she said.</p> <p>Yet even without an official determination of whether the US is in a recession, polling has found that most Americans believe it is: something likely to cause Democrats pain at the ballot box in November’s crucial elections.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/politics/cnn-poll-joe-biden-economy-us/index.html\">a recent CNN poll</a>, 64% of Americans “feel” the economy is in recession, including 56% of Democrats and 63% of independents. The same survey found that four in 10 view the economy as “very poor”, an 11-point rise since the spring.</p> <p>Biden defended his administration’s actions, arguing that the economic stimulus plan was “the reason why we still had teachers in school, kids going to school, the reason why we had cops on the beat, the reason we had essential workers,” during the depths of the pandemic. But he admitted that the “vast majority of Americans have no idea what the recovery plan did”.</p> <p>Now, with their congressional majorities hanging in the balance, Democrats must persuade voters to trust their economic leadership as they rush to pass Biden’s economic agenda, which they vow will help, not hurt American pocketbooks.</p> <p>Manchin, who just weeks ago appeared to walk away from his party’s economic plans over concerns that it would worsen inflation, said his newfound support for the measure was based on assurances that it would not.</p> <p>Explaining his decision, Manchin told reporters: “This is truly going to be around inflation reduction.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/28/england-south-africa-second-t20-match-report-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T21:10:14Z","webTitle":"Rilee Rossouw hits 96 as South Africa win and level T20 series against England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/28/england-south-africa-second-t20-match-report-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/28/england-south-africa-second-t20-match-report-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Rilee Rossouw hits 96 as South Africa win and level T20 series against England","trailText":"Rilee Rossouw scored 96, helping South Africa post 207 before they bowled England out and set up the series decider at the Ageas Bowl","byline":"Simon Burnton at Sophia Gardens","body":"<p>South Africa levelled the series with a mighty 58-run victory over England in Cardiff on a night of glorious rediscovery for the tourists, for whom both Rilee Rossouw and the ability to catch returned in phenomenal style.</p> <p>The Proteas’ defeat in Wednesday’s opening fixture in Bristol was marked by some hapless fielding but here they were almost faultless. Their improvement was not confined to catching but nevertheless not a single genuine chance went unsnaffled, with Keshav Maharaj providing the highlight with a fabulous diving grab to dismiss Moeen Ali, leaving England’s score at 88 for four and their chances at minimal.</p> <p>Several bowlers emerged in significant credit including Tabraiz Shamsi, who leaked 49 runs in three wicketless overs the previous evening and took three for 27 off four here. But if they sealed the deal in the field it was with the bat that South Africa built the platform.</p> <p>Rossouw, 32, was instrumental in that effort. For the last six years he has wandered, entirely voluntarily, in the international wilderness. This series marks his first appearance in the South Africa side since taking a Kolpak contract at Hampshire and leaving his homeland in acrimony in 2016 and he showed what they have been missing in the intervening period – and what they have now gained as they move towards October’s T20 World Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/28/england-v-south-africa-second-mens-t20-international-live\">South Africa beat England by 58 runs to win second men’s T20 – as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He finished unbeaten on 96 having faced 55 deliveries, marooned short of his century thanks to a superb final over from Chris Jordan, which cost just four runs. “To put in a performance like that for my country is special for me,” Rossouw said. “Since Brexit happened I’ve put in some really good performances and the management has backed me and selected me. Representing your country is the proudest thing anyone can do and today was emotional for me.”</p> <p>Though Quinton de Kock fell early, South Africa eased their way into the middle overs without great drama or further loss. Reeza Hendricks instantly rediscovered the form that brought him a half-century in Bristol while at this point Rossouw simply tried to keep pace.</p> <p>Hendricks eventually fell to an excellent catch from Jonny Bairstow after scoring 53 off 32. Though his innings contained two sixes his final shot was the furthest he hit the ball all evening, but it flew towards the most distant point on the longest boundary and did not quite travel far enough.</p> <p>Rossouw reacted to the end of their 73-run partnership as if personally affronted, hitting 36 off his next 16 deliveries despite spearing one of them into the underside of his own chin. First Heinrich Klaasen and then Tristan Stubbs watched him go from the other end, the latter kept under a measure of control after Wednesday’s fireworks.</p> <p>England’s innings was not one they will want to linger on, but along the way Jos Buttler demonstrated the first clear difference between his captaincy and that of his predecessor, Eoin Morgan. He promoted Moeen once again, the all-rounder coming in after Dawid Malan fell for just five, and was himself replaced by Sam Curran, left-hander following left-hander as Buttler prioritised contrasting partnerships over notional batting order. But Curran only lasted three balls, at which point England ran out of left-handers and their innings entered a terminal tailspin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It had started promisingly, with Buttler unleashing a succession of brutal blows.

But in the Hundred, whose second season gets under way next Wednesday, the 35-year-old will combine continued duties with Sky with captaining London Spirit, and he believes the competition could come to be vitally important in retaining the cream of domestic talent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/27/england-south-africa-first-t20-international-match-report\">Bairstow and Moeen provide fireworks as England sink South Africa in first T20</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There are already some tournaments in the world that are bigger than a lot of countries’ fixtures, bilateral series and anything else they play in between [ICC events],” Morgan said. “Ultimately it’s already happening and we’re probably behind the eight ball. We’re very, very lucky the Hundred has been the success it has, so we can develop the product and have the players involved.”</p> <p>Though the Blast has been running since 2003, Morgan said it has taken the Hundred to insulate English cricket against the prospect of its biggest talents being tempted elsewhere. “For the majority of my career I’ve been a huge advocate for players going abroad and playing in big tournaments and taking on different roles, either as one of the senior players within the group, or one of a number of overseas players within a team,” he said. “There’s a different level of expectation around that. But when we have such a good tournament at home now, there’s no reason for that to happen in the same way.”</p> <p>Though the Indian Premier League, the biggest and most lucrative of the global franchise tournaments, recently agreed broadcast deals worth more than £5bn, Morgan said that “we are still very early in the commercialisation of franchise cricket and T20 cricket”, and that their growth is likely to come at the cost of the international game.</p> <p>“For me, international cricket has always been the thing I strived to play in, and I’ve loved the opportunity of playing for Ireland and England. It allowed me to play against the best in the world. If that changes and the scale tips, I think it tips in only one direction.</p> <p>“The one thing the franchise model takes away from international cricket is a little bit of control, and ideally a franchise would want control of the biggest asset any country has – which is the players. Once you have that, what does international cricket offer? How much viability does it bring? The one thing it brings at the moment is [the chance to] have the best playing against the best the majority of the time. But once you take that away …”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One undoubted impact of last year’s Hundred was a push to the career of Liam Livingstone, who had made just two international appearances before 2021 but whose success in various T20 leagues over the preceding winter was capped by a series of astonishing performances for the beaten finalists, Birmingham Phoenix, and who has since become a key member of England’s white-ball teams. Morgan believes there is a chance another player can use this year’s Hundred as a springboard into the T20 World Cup team – but only if they are a bowler.</p> <p>“I’d struggle to see the majority of batters involved in the setup being replaced,” Morgan said. “But Jos Buttler identifies the death bowling as somewhere we need to improve and in the spin department, there’s clearly question marks over Adil Rashid’s replacement. So through the Hundred that’s probably the biggest opportunity for guys coming in to try to make a point of difference.”</p> <p><em>Eoin Morgan will be attending Sky Sports’ Every Ball Counts event in Manchester on Saturday from 12-4pm; for more details go <a href=\"https://aboutmanchester.co.uk/sky-sports-brings-the-hundred-to-manchester-with-star-studded-event-tickets-to-give-away-this-weekend/\">here</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/jul/28/england-v-south-africa-second-mens-t20-international-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T20:57:20Z","webTitle":"South Africa beat England by 58 runs to win second men’s T20 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/28/england-v-south-africa-second-mens-t20-international-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/jul/28/england-v-south-africa-second-mens-t20-international-live","fields":{"headline":"South Africa beat England by 58 runs to win second men’s T20 – as it happened","trailText":"Rilee Rossouw pounded an unbeaten 96 as South Africa squared the series with an emphatic victory in Cardiff","byline":"Rob Smyth","body":"<div id=\"block-62e2f8748f08af33ff4a2fa9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T21:10:29.201Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Simon Burnton’s match report has landed</strong>, so I’ll leave you with that.

No remarks were expected after the working dinner.</p> \n<p>“Obviously, this isn’t about casting aside our principles. It’s not about calling into question our commitment in favour of human rights. The president will surely have an opportunity to talk about this with Mohammed bin Salman,” Borne said.</p> \n<p>But she added: “In a context where we know that Russia is cutting … gas supplies and where we have tensions over energy prices, I think the French would not understand if we didn’t talk to the countries that are, precisely, producers of energy.”</p> \n<p>A Macron aide said that for the president “to have an influence and tackle the problems that European countries and France face … the only way is to talk with all of our partners”, repeating France’s demand that those responsible for Khashoggi’s brutal strangling and dismemberment be “brought to justice”.</p> \n<p>During his visit, the Saudi crown prince stayed at the lavish Château Louis XIV in Louveciennes, a wealthy suburb west of Paris. Built in 2009, the 7,000-square-metre chateau was acquired by Prince Mohammed in 2015 for a reported €275m, prompting Fortune magazine to call it the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2015/12/15/worlds-most-expensive-home/\">world’s most expensive home</a>.</p> \n<p>The UN’s investigation into Khashoggi’s death concluded that there was “credible evidence” to justify further investigation of high-level Saudi officials, including Prince Mohammed, who US intelligence agencies have said approved the operation. Riyadh has blamed rogue agents.</p> \n<p>The US president, Joe Biden, travelled to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, greeting the crown prince <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/15/fist-bumps-as-joe-biden-arrives-to-reset-ties-with-pariah-saudi-arabia\">with a fist bump</a>, while Macron visited the kingdom for talks with him last December and Britain’s Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/16/boris-johnson-upbeat-on-saudi-oil-supply-as-kingdom-executes-three-more\">followed suit in March</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"52c9eb1f-17a8-468e-a55a-a5b340b0347e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YPg5bji4aKs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Human rights groups and Khashoggi’s fiancee were strongly critical. Prince Mohammed’s visit to France and Biden’s trip to Saudi Arabia “do not change the fact that [Prince Mohammed] is anything other than a killer”, said Agnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, describing the 36-year-old crown prince as a man who “does not tolerate dissent”.</p> \n<p>Callamard, who at the time of the killing was the UN’s special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings and who led its independent investigation, told Agence France-Presse she was “profoundly troubled by the visit, because of what it means for our world and what it means for Jamal [Khashoggi] and people like him”.</p> \n<p>The crown prince’s reception by world leaders was “all the more shocking given many of them at the time expressed disgust and a commitment not to bring him back into the international community”, she added, denouncing “double standards” and “values … being obliterated in the face of concern about the rising price of oil”.</p> \n<p>The head of Human Rights Watch in France, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenJeannerod/status/1552328218287431683\">Bénédicte Jeannerod, tweeted</a> that Bin Salman could “apparently count on Emmanuel Macron to rehabilitate him on the international stage despite the atrocious murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the pitiless repression of all criticism by the Saudi authorities, and war crimes in Yemen”.</p> \n<p>Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s fiancee, told AFP she was “scandalised and outraged” that Macron was receiving “with all the honours the executioner of my fiance”. She added: “All the international investigations carried out up to this point … recognise [Prince Mohammed’s] responsibility in the assassination.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Two NGOs, the US-based Democracy for the Arab World Now (Dawn), which Khashoggi founded in 2018, and the Swiss campaign group Trial International, <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/07/28/plainte-contre-le-prince-heritier-saoudien-dans-l-affaire-khashoggi_6136441_3210.html\">on Thursday filed a joint formal complaint</a> in Paris against Prince Mohammed for “complicity in torture” and “enforced disappearance”.</p> \n<p>The initiative, supported by the Open Society Justice Initiative, was filed under universal jurisdiction, which allows a state to try crimes against humanity, war crimes and acts of torture committed outside its territory.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/08/joe-manchin-build-back-better-biden\">resistance to Biden’s flagship $1.8tn Build Back Better</a> spending package, which he scuppered because he didn’t like the cost. He told Punchbowl:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Remember when I told you I didn’t walk away? I never walked away. I’ve never walked away from anything.</em></p> <p><em>And I’ve been trying to tell people that. The bottom line was inflation scared the bejesus out of me at 9.1%. I said, ‘I’m gonna go back and re-scrub that bill.’ And then, you know, Chuck and I have a little bit of a relationship, if you will. Good, bad, indifferent at times, but it’s always been respectful and he got mad...</em></p> <p><em>So Monday, I said, ‘Chuck, I’m not walking away, never have, my people are still working. If you want to see if we can basically scrub everything and make sure it’s not inflationary.’ That’s just how this went. </em></p> <p><em>And he says, ‘Yeah, we’re willing to engage again.’ And I said, ‘OK, if you want to engage again.’ I said, ‘We haven’t stopped, we’re going through everything, taking out anything that we think could be inflammatory.’</em></p> <p><em>And I gotta give him credit, they were OK. And we went through the whole thing.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Now the reconciliation bill is announced, and assuming it passes the scrutiny of the House and Senate parliamentarians, Democrats have to get it passed. </p> <p>They will need all 50 of their votes in the Senate, and Arizona’s <strong>Kyrsten Sinema</strong> is a notable tax-hike skeptic.

It’s no surprise that every major national business organisation, including some in the resources sector, have supported legislated targets.</p> <p>Legislating targets is not an alien concept for Liberals. At the same time as this legislation was being introduced, the Victorian state Liberals and Nationals were legislating a 50% 2030 target.</p> <p>In my first term in parliament, I strongly supported the national energy guarantee developed by Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg. At its core was legislation that would have locked in our Paris agreement targets of 26 to 28% by 2030. This was endorsed by the Coalition cabinet and the overwhelming majority of the Coalition party room at the time.</p> <p>Some in the Coalition will argue that a 43% reduction by 2030 is too ambitious. The reality is that the pace of change and the transition to a low emissions economy is advancing at a rate that can give us some confidence. It is a target 8% higher than the Morrison government’s forecast of a 35% reduction being achievable. It is also lower than state governments’ targets of 50% – including the Perrottet Coalition government in New South Wales.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a> </p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mandates for policies pursued by political parties and candidates during election campaigns are perplexing concepts in our democratic system.

This was a deciding factor – not some trifling side issue.</p> <p>When a party is on the losing side of an election, it would be unorthodox to double down on policies that helped facilitate defeat. Moreover, thinking ahead, where will the Coalition want to be at the next election – would it seriously consider promising to roll back a 43% target, particularly if good progress continues?

It was there that, in 2009, England and Germany first met in a Women’s European Championship final. On paper it might have appeared a clash of the titans but England were not quite there yet: Germany began as overwhelming favourites and duly beat Hope Powell’s side 6-2, reasserting themselves as continental heavyweights. Birgit Prinz and company put on a masterclass but only 15,000 people were present in the storied venue to witness it.</p> \n<p>When this year’s England crop beat a weakened German side 3-1 at Molineux in February, it was only the second time this fixture had fallen the Lionesses’ way. That tells nothing of how the gap has closed. What reveals rather more is the fact that, however often the 2022 final is played in the head, it feels impossible to pick a clear winner. The outcome may well be on a knife edge and, with an audience up to six times higher than the crowd that rattled around in Finland, the atmosphere should ensure things feel that way immediately.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/28/sarina-wiegman-unerringly-good-england-yet-to-revive-familiar-pain-womens-euro-2022\">Sarina Wiegman’s unerringly good England are yet to revive my familiar pain | Max Rushden</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“A once-in-a lifetime experience” was how the excellent Germany goalkeeper, Merle Frohms, referred to the prospect of Sunday. “You couldn’t have dreamed of a better final, to be facing the host nation in their own stadium.” The organisers will be pinching themselves too. There is no other way of putting it: this is a classic final, an event whose history needs no explaining but is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet when measured on skill, bravery and sheer sporting excellence too.</p> \n<p>Another four-goal margin of victory for either side seems unthinkable although both have made light of similar predictions in the past three weeks. England were expected to face trouble against Norway but cruised home with bemusing ease and emphasis; they then overwhelmed Sweden despite riding their luck in the first half.</p> \n<p>Germany, having done their best to cast themselves as dark horses before the tournament, showed up at Brentford and promptly demolished the much-fancied Denmark 4-0. That is what these teams can do: they can outwit, outplay and eventually overwhelm. When they face one another, all bets will be off.</p> \n<p>“Determined, modest, successful” was how the German newspaper Zeit described Martina Voss-Tecklenburg’s team after the win over France. Those words are apt: there is a humility about Germany’s work, an ability to balance flair with fastidiousness, perhaps best exemplified by the perfectly reasonable argument that their best player in these championships has been the 20-year-old holding midfielder Lena Oberdorf.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dfa4bc2a-45bd-401d-b166-e1f2d2768e53\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3c7DFgcjdk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Like England, they have been kept honest for all their rampaging forward play. While the hosts came within minutes of crashing out in the quarter-finals before salvaging what had been a listless performance against Spain, Die Nationalelf rode their luck at times when they met Austria in the last eight and could have come unstuck against France on Wednesday before Alexandra Popp’s supremely taken winner. Both finalists have known what it is to purr through games and take delight in one another’s talents, but both have cause to feel battle-hardened too.</p> \n<p>If anything should make the Germans feel particularly ill at ease, it is England’s capacity to grow stronger as the minutes tick on, spurred by the wealth of options Sarina Wiegman can call upon from the bench. France and Austria faded in the latter stages of their knockout ties, even if the former kept aiming balls into Frohm’s box until the end; England are less likely to go away and the sharpness of an Alessia Russo or Ella Toone from the bench is something Germany have not been required to contend with so far.</p> \n<p>On the flipside Popp, who would be many onlookers’ player of the tournament both for her potency and the sheer romance of her return from career-threatening injury, started the group stage among the substitutes and might have struggled for as much game time had Lea Schüller not tested positive for Covid-19 after the Denmark game.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/mary-earps-business-euro-2022-final-de-gea-england\">Mary Earps ready to do the business in Euros final thanks to De Gea dealings</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Likewise, Germany did not miss the similarly indisposed Klara Bühl, the best winger of a pleasing number this summer, too much against France even though her absence also caused Svenja Huth to switch position. Schüller and Bühl may be ready to play a part in the final. The point is that depth and flexibility are as important to both England and Germany as what happens from the start: it would not be outlandish to suggest that the most significant events at Wembley will be shaped by decisions made after the interval.</p> \n<p>“We’re happy with what we achieved, but not satisfied with what we achieved,” said Powell after the defeat 13 years ago had sunk in. “It will make them stronger next time and one day it will be our day.”</p> \n<p>That looks a safe assertion now, and England’s task is to make sure the moment comes on an evening that will showcase their sport like never before. Pubs will do brisk business, big screens will be set up, squares may even fill. If England and Germany produce anything like the spectacle both have promised, the progress women’s football and this competition have made since Helsinki will hardly have been clearer.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Have you seen our Women’s Euro 2022 marketing activity online?

The GIDS has faced relentless scrutiny in recent years, with a number of former staff going public to raise concerns about the “overdiagnosing” of gender dysphoria, the consequences of early medical interventions and the significant increase in referrals of girls questioning their gender identity – which is a trend reflected across Europe and globally.</p> <p>The controversy deepened in 2020, when the centre was taken to court by Keira Bell, a former patient, who argued she had been too young to consent to the medical treatment overseen by the GIDS that began her female-to-male transition as a teenager. Bell won her initial case but it was overturned on appeal, with the court of appeal reaffirming the principle of <a href=\"https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/child-protection-system/gillick-competence-fraser-guidelines\">Gillick competence</a> that “it was for doctors and not judges to decide on the capacity of a person under 16 to consent to medical treatment”. This was a relief to those who feared a chilling effect on the rights of young trans people.</p> <p>But the fact is there has been unusual unanimity at both ends of the spectrum of those who concern themselves with healthcare for gender-dysphoric young people. Trans healthcare experts were perhaps more reticent to criticise the service directly, but highlighted the damage done by lengthy waiting times and the impossibility of a London-based service catering for the whole of England and Wales.</p> <p>In March, a review of gender identity services for young people led by the paediatrician Hilary Cass confirmed what everyone knew: that the service was under “unsustainable pressure” as demand outstripped capacity, resulting in overwhelmed staff and waiting lists of up to two years that left young people at considerable risk of distress and deteriorating mental health.</p> <p>Cass <a href=\"https://cass.independent-review.uk/publications/\">recommended</a> the creation of a network of regional hubs to provide care and support, a recommendation accepted by the NHS.</p> <p>The question now is: what happens next? Some initial concerns have been raised about a possible gap in service provision, but patients have been assured there will be a smooth transition to the early adopter hubs in London and Manchester, with the expectation they will become fully operational in spring 2023. A further three hubs are planned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are some ethical worries about Cass’s suggestion that access to hormone treatment should be accompanied by enrolment into a formal research programme.<em><strong> </strong></em>While it is not unusual to use anonymised data to improve outcomes, it is perhaps an indication of the breakdown in trust between transgender people and the government, in particular since the U-turn on banning conversion practices, that these fears persist.</p> <p>Specialists at the GIDS say the rise in demand should be kept in perspective – only one in 10,000 young people are referred to the highly specialised service – and that an overrepresentation of girls could equally be an underrepresentation of boys, for whom gender non-conformity tends to be more aggressively policed by peers.</p> <p>And what impact does this announcement have on the thousands of young people and their families awaiting treatment? Many report having to go private in order to access timely treatment. Waiting lists remain so painfully long that it is unlikely the impact of the new hubs will be felt for some time. </p> <p><br>• This article was amended on 3 August 2022.

At Manchin’s insistence, $306bn is earmarked for debt reduction.</p> <p>The package, called the Inflation Reduction Act, would cut US emissions 40% by 2030, a summary released by Schumer’s office said, and earned praise from clean-energy advocates and Democratic party elders.</p> <p>Barack Obama, the former president, tweeted: “I’m grateful to President Biden and those in Congress – Democrat or Republican – who are working to deliver for the American people. Progress doesn’t always happen all at once, but it does happen – and this is what it looks like.”</p> <p>Al Gore, an ex-vice-president whose 2006 documentary film An Inconvenient Truth helped raise awareness of the climate crisis, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/algore/status/1552473730458296321?s=20&amp;t=9azA1-APgIF8MW7r1JP40g\">wrote on Twitter</a>: “The Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to be a historic turning point. It represents the single largest investment in climate solutions &amp; environmental justice in US history. Decades of tireless work by climate advocates across the country led to this moment.”</p> <p>Another component of the package would allow Medicare, the government-run healthcare programme for the elderly and disabled, to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, saving the federal government $288bn over the 10-year budget window.</p> <p>The Manchin-Schumer measure is substantially smaller than the $3.5tn Build Back Better spending bill that Biden asked Democrats to push through Congress last year.</p> <p>But it gave him a political win when he most needed it. His administration has been assailed by a cascade of setbacks including the war in Ukraine, a series of conservative supreme court rulings, soaring inflation and, on Thursday, a GDP report that showed gross domestic product shrank for the second consecutive quarter this year.</p> <p>This backdrop has left the president struggling with low job approval ratings and ebbing support from his own party. A CNN poll this week found that 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than him in the 2024 election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64ae5cf8477f3f16bdcb935268cc3e2f9945957\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64ae5cf8477f3f16bdcb935268cc3e2f9945957/0_0_4807_2884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The draft legislation was worked out between Senator Joe Manchin, left, and the majority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The draft legislation was worked out between Senator Joe Manchin, left, and the majority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the surprise Senate deal, coming <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josh_wingrove/status/1552436155114995713?s=20&amp;t=1DvnmkbauttZc1DhAoBizw\">on the same day</a> that the Senate passed legislation boosting domestic production of computer chips and Biden completed his recovery from a coronavirus infection, gave a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel.</p> <p><a href=\"https://johnzogbystrategies.com/\">John Zogby</a>, an author and pollster, said there had already been signs that the president’s approval rating was improving. “This could very well be the critical win. First of all, it’s coming in the context of a few other wins: the manufacturing bill is another and, at the same time, there’s a sense the gas prices are going down. It’s an important piece of Build Back Better and it looks like it can happen. This could lift expectations.”</p> <p>The deal is a boost for Democrats ahead of midterm elections on 8 November that will determine control of Congress. Zogby added: “Democrats can go back to voters and say, ‘Look, we accomplished something. It may not have been what you wanted but here’s our first real accomplishment on climate change.’”</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathankott\">Jonathan Kott</a>, a former communications director for Manchin, told the MSNBC network: “Democrats really need to seize on this moment and tell this story, scream it at the top of their lungs. If this was Donald Trump, he’d be out there having press conferences in the Rose Garden all over the country. We should be doing the same thing.”</p> <p>The deal marked a dramatic U-turn by Manchin, a conservative Democrat and the swing vote in the evenly divided Senate, who has received more donations from oil and gas companies than any other legislator in recent years. Earlier this month he drew fierce condemnation from climate activists for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/16/joe-manchin-biden-climate-democrats-climate-plans\">apparently scuttling Biden’s spending plans</a>, claiming that he was concerned about inflation.</p> <p>On Wednesday Manchin, who aimed to preserve federal oil and gas leasing projects and natural gas pipelines during months of talks, said the bill will invest in hydrogen, nuclear power, renewables, fossil fuels and energy storage. “This bill does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels.”</p> <p>Democrats hope to pass the bill by a simple majority in the Senate. Schumer told colleagues on Thursday that they now have an opportunity to achieve two “hugely important” priorities on healthcare and climate change, the Associated Press reported, but warned that final passage will be hard.</p> <p>It remains unclear whether Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who like Manchin has been a perennial thorn in Biden’s side, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1552450904946720769\">will vote in favour</a>.

It still faces obstacles before passing but the support of Manchin, a crucial swing vote in an evenly divided US Senate, appears to augur well for its chances. So what’s in the legislation?</p> <h2>The basics of the bill</h2> <p>The climate spending is part of a broader package, <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf\">known as the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, that totals $739bn. The majority of this bill, however, is dedicated to confronting the climate crisis, with $369bn dedicated to the crisis over the next 10 years.</p> <p>It’s part of a reconciliation budget that can only be passed with all 50 Democratic votes in the Senate, due to unified Republican opposition, meaning Manchin’s acquiescence was critical.</p> <h2>What does it include to address the climate emergency?</h2> <p>The bulk of the bill allows for large tax credits for clean energy, such as solar and wind power, to allow such projects to go ahead on a grand scale. States and utilities will also get $30bn to help the transition to renewable, zero carbon electricity.</p> <p>A new $27bn “clean energy technology accelerator” will be created to help advance renewable technologies, $3bn will be given to the US postal service to electrify its fleet of trucks and there will be a new program to drive down leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas drilling operations.</p> <p>A further $20bn will be spent to promote climate-friendly agricultural practices and another $5bn to make American forests better prepared for the wildfires that increasingly threaten them due to global heating.</p> <h2>What will people be able to access directly from this bill?</h2> <p>The legislation includes a tax credit worth up to $7,500 for people who want to buy a new electric car, which has until now largely been the preserve of wealthier Americans.</p> <p>There is also a $9bn scheme, focused on low-income households, to electrify home appliances and make dwellings more energy efficient. Further tax credits, spread out over the next decade, will make it easier to buy heat pumps, rooftop solar and water heaters.</p> <p>Disadvantaged communities that suffer the brunt of fossil fuel pollution have also been recognized, with $60bn dedicated to environmental justice projects across the US.</p> <h2>Are there any criticisms of the bill?</h2> <p>The spending is a big reduction on the $550bn initially envisioned by Biden and Democratic leaders but sunk by Manchin’s opposition. The final bill amounts to far less, even over 10 years, than what the US spends annually on its military.</p> <p>The bill doesn’t include any mechanism to specifically phase out fossil fuels, the primary cause of the climate crisis, and, indeed, looks to lock in their use for decades to come due to a compromise struck with Manchin. Under the deal, regulations around drilling will be loosened and new leases will be offered in places such as the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Environmentalists have called this arrangement a “climate suicide pact”.</p> <h2>How significant is this?</h2> <p>Despite its imperfections, the bill is expected by both its authors and independent analysts to allow the US to cut its emissions by 40% by 2030, based on 2005 levels. This brings the US close to Biden’s goal of slashing emissions in half this decade, which scientists have said is imperative if the world is to avoid catastrophic climate change.</p> <h2>What does it mean for the world?</h2> <p>The US is the world’s largest economy, the world’s second largest carbon polluter and a superpower in diplomatic and military might. Its failure, thus far, to meaningfully act on the climate crisis has constrained global efforts and so this legislation, if passed, could prove to be an “historic turning point”, as Al Gore, the former US vice-president, put it.</p> <p>World governments meeting later this year at UN climate talks in Egypt could be emboldened to do more to cut their own emissions, while the direct impact of the US reductions could mean that heatwaves, floods and other disasters will be less severe than they would have been otherwise.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jul/28/with-such-eye-watering-profits-shell-should-invest-more-in-low-carbon-transition","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T18:11:01Z","webTitle":"With such eye-watering profits, Shell should invest more in low-carbon transition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jul/28/with-such-eye-watering-profits-shell-should-invest-more-in-low-carbon-transition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jul/28/with-such-eye-watering-profits-shell-should-invest-more-in-low-carbon-transition","fields":{"headline":"With such eye-watering profits, Shell should invest more in low-carbon transition","trailText":"Shell could afford to allocate far greater sums to investment but is choosing not to do so","byline":"Nils Pratley","body":"<p>BP’s Bernard Looney put it more succinctly last year when he described the company as “a cash machine at these types of prices”, but Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, was coming from the same place as he reflected on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/shell-posts-10bn-quarterly-profits-as-households-struggle-with-bills\">almost £10bn of profits in a single quarter</a>. “Of course these are very significant [profit] margins, but these margins are not our doing. They are the doing of how global markets play out,” he said.</p> <p>He’s right about market conditions obviously. A barrel of Brent fetched well over $100 during the quarter, gas prices have gone to the moon; refining capacity is severely tight; and the entire industry underinvested during the first year of the pandemic, creating near-perfect conditions for a spike in prices when Russia invaded Ukraine.</p> <p>But the maddening bit of Van Beurden’s breezy account is what he says in the next breath – the claim to be “working very hard to bring on new supplies” and to be investing furiously in “the energy system of the future”, meaning a lower carbon one. Shell, it is obvious, could afford to allocate far greater sums to investment, including renewables, but is choosing not to do so.</p> <p>Current plans involve numbers that look large at first sight: $23bn to $27bn of capital expenditure this year, with a one-third skew towards renewables; and, for a UK audience, an average of £3bn-a-year to be invested here until the end of the decade. The point, though, is that those spending plans flow from a model that was drawn up 18 months ago before a windfall fell into Shell’s lap.</p> <p>The “financial framework” imagines that every last dollar, beyond what’s ear-marked for investment, debt-servicing and regular dividends, goes to shareholders via share buy-backs. The size of these buy-backs is now extraordinary: $6bn for the current quarter, after $8.5bn in the first half. Add regular dividends, and Shell, a company worth £150bn, could return 15% of its market capitalisation to investors in 2022.</p> <p>Shareholders and pension funds must have prizes, of course, but allocating no extra capital towards low-carbon projects is indefensible given the resources suddenly at Shell’s disposal. The company calls its approach “disciplined”, but it is behaving as if nothing has changed, or that it has run out of ideas. The story here is not simply one of markets “playing out”. It is also about the pace at which the company funds transition. Shell could transition faster – much faster.</p> <h2>Reading the room</h2> <p>By contrast, it is impossible to get angry about Centrica’s modest dividend for shareholders, even if it attracts more political flak. The owner of British Gas hasn’t paid a dividend for two years and a half-year distribution of £59m, or a penny a share, does not come at the expense of useful investment.</p> <p>The most important looming investment decision relates to the re-opening of the Rough offshore storage facility in the North Sea, which, everybody now agrees, should never have been closed. For the sake of energy security (gas and, in future, hydrogen), it is vital the company and the UK government find a contract-for-difference arrangement.</p> <p>The contribution of British Gas, the retail supply business, to half-year operating profits of £1.3bn wasn’t much – £98m, equivalent to a profit margin of 2%. Instead, the money was mostly made in North Sea production and via higher prices for nuclear-generated electricity (Centrica owns a 20% stake in the UK’s fleet). Since those assets are captured by the windfall tax, outrage about the dividends should fade.</p> <p>Distribution to shareholders are allowed, after all – indeed are vital to keep investment flowing. It’s the level, and the other aspects of a company’s performance, that matter. Shell looks grasping. Centrica, now that it’s stopped grumbling about the windfall tax and is talking about decarbonising projects, looks better attuned to the mood outside.</p> <h2>Never-boring Barclays</h2> <p>Many chief executives in the recent past have tried to make Barclays boring. CS Venkatakrishnan, who was supposed to mark a break from the era of regulatory thrills and spills under Jes Staley (and others before him), isn’t there yet.</p> <p>The lowlight of the half-year numbers was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/barclays-reveals-40-fall-in-profits-after-having-to-put-aside-15bn\">a £581m net charge for a cock-up</a> that saw the bank sell more structured notes – securities giving exposure to baskets of stocks, interest rates and so on – than it was authorised to flog.</p> <p>The “litigation and conduct” fun continued via a $200m whack from US regulators’ clamp-down on traders sending work messages via WhatsApp, and a penalty for past larks with timeshare loans. The actual operational performance was fine, but you can see why the shares continue to be lowly rated. You never know what’s coming next with Barclays.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/jul/28/slough-could-raise-council-tax-by-20-and-be-forced-to-sell-off-thousands-of-assets","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T18:08:33Z","webTitle":"Bankrupt Slough could raise council tax by 20% and be forced to sell off assets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/28/slough-could-raise-council-tax-by-20-and-be-forced-to-sell-off-thousands-of-assets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jul/28/slough-could-raise-council-tax-by-20-and-be-forced-to-sell-off-thousands-of-assets","fields":{"headline":"Bankrupt Slough could raise council tax by 20% and be forced to sell off assets","trailText":"Local authority told to offload thousands of assets including council houses in stark report, a year after declaring bankruptcy","byline":"Patrick Butler","body":"<p>A bankrupt local authority could have to raise council tax by 20% a year and will be forced to sell off thousands of homes and other assets under “unprecedented” plans imposed on it after it ran up catastrophic debts amid overspending running into hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> <p>The scale of the financial and management chaos at Labour-run Slough council is revealed in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/slough-borough-council-commissioners-first-report\">stark report </a>by a team of government commissioners sent in to run the authority after it declared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/02/slough-goes-bankrupt-after-discovery-of-100m-black-hole-in-budget\">effective bankruptcy</a> a year ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/local-government-in-england-hollowed-out-under-conservatives\">Local government in England ‘hollowed out’ under Conservatives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It calls on ministers to give special powers to commissioners to effectively rebuild “the basics of local government” in an authority it says lacks top-level leadership, faces a major staffing crisis and struggles to deliver what it calls “extremely fragile” services.</p> <p>The council has been told to offload hundreds of millions of pounds’ worth of assets to fund its recovery programme, including its stock of about 6,700 council houses, and a number of <a href=\"https://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/20292513.slough-council-sell-major-housing-sites/\">development sites </a>earmarked for housebuilding.</p> <p>But the report warns council leaders that even a fire sale of assets – everything the authority owns except roads and parks is said to be “on the table” – may not be sufficient and that it may need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/04/councils-have-been-short-changed-we-need-more-government-money\">financial support from government</a> for up to eight more years.</p> <p>The parlous state of Slough’s finances mean local residents face potential council tax increases of between 12% and 20% in each of the next three years, the report says.

A CWU source said the union expected between 30 and 70 MPs to join BT workers at pickets, with Tarry due to attend one in central London. One shadow minister is also believed to be considering attending a picket.</p> <p>The most vocal criticism of Starmer’s approach has come from the left of the party.

Ivanka was walking down the main hallway in the West Wing when she passed him. Unaware of his heated state of mind, she said, ‘Hello, chief.’ Kelly shoved her out of the way and stormed by. She wasn’t hurt, and didn’t make a big deal about the altercation, but in his rage Kelly had shown his true character.”</p> <p>Kushner writes that Kelly offered a “meek” apology about an hour later.</p> <p>Kelly told the Post: “I don’t recall anything like you describe. It is inconceivable that I would EVER shove a woman. Inconceivable. Never happen. Would never intentionally do something like that. Also, don’t remember ever apologising to her for something I didn’t do. I’d remember that.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Ivanka Trump said her husband’s description was accurate, the Post said.</p> <p>The Post also said Kushner writes that Kelly gave his wife “compliments to her face that she knew were insincere.</p> <p>“Then the four-star general would call her staff to his office and berate and intimidate them over trivial procedural issues that his rigid system often created. He would frequently refer to her initiatives like paid family leave and the child tax credit as ‘Ivanka’s pet projects.’”</p> <p>Kushner also describes a confrontation between Kelly and Chinese officials in Beijing in 2017 in which Kushner says the former general was overly aggressive. Kelly defended his conduct to the Post and said he accepted a Chinese apology.</p> <p>Kushner writes: “In that moment, I finally understood John Kelly. To him, everything was a game of establishing dominance and control. He made people feel small and unimportant to establish the relationship from a place of power. Then, with his position firmly established, he would charm and disarm, leaving people relieved that they were on his good side, but fearful of what would happen if they crossed him.”</p> <p>The alleged shove of Ivanka was also mentioned by a New York Times reporter, Kenneth P Vogel, amid a string of revelations from Kushner’s book.</p> <p>In tweets, Vogel revealed Kushner’s version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/jared-kushner-murdoch-trump-arizona-election-2020\">a 2020 election-night call</a> with the Fox News owner, Rupert Murdoch; Trump’s comments on pardons and sentencing reform and White House dynamics on the issue; and Kushner’s view of Steve Bannon, the former strategist Trump pardoned on charges of fraud.</p> <p>Kushner was a senior adviser to his father-in-law throughout Trump’s four years in the White House. Kelly, once of the US Marine Corps, was the second of four chiefs of staff. In a chaotic and leak-prone White House, relations between Kelly and Trump quickly soured.

These waves bounce off blood vessels, tissues and internal organs are detected by the same elements in the patch. At the moment, the patch has to be connected to an instrument that turns the reflections into images, but the researchers are developing a wireless patch to work with software on a mobile phone.</p> <p>“We are working hard on the wireless version,” Zhao said. “Because there are already wireless point-of-care handhold ultrasounds, we are confident that we will be able to achieve the wireless version in a few years.” Details of the patch are <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2542\">published in Science</a>.</p> <p>Even without a wireless version, the patches could make an immediate difference in hospitals, the researchers say, by monitoring patients’ insides while they lie in bed, much as stick-on electrodes are used to monitor their heart activity.</p> <p>Ultrasound scans are extremely common, with NHS England performing more than 8m last year. But the technique has major limitations, requiring highly trained sonographers to place and orient the probes on patients’ bodies to get high-quality images. For this reason, most ultrasound scans are brief and performed on patients who are required to keep still while the images are taken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wireless patches could sidestep some of these problems, as they can be fixed in position and left to take images for hours, and even days, at a time, the researchers say.

output fell 18% to 14.6m tonnes in the period from April to June. </p> \n  <p>Second-quarter sales, however, grew by 14.5% to just over €22bn (£18.3bn) driven by a circa 30% increase in steel prices.

He took four for 18 in five overs as the visitors were bowled out with a lead of 247. Surrey seemed to have saved all their best shots for the final chase – including three sixes from Will Jacks to win the game.</p> <p>Steve Patterson, whose contract will not be renewed next season, announced his resignation as <strong>Yorkshire</strong> captain after their defeat to Hampshire. An aggressive opening stand from Ian Holland and Felix Organ put <strong>Hampshire</strong> quickly on their way to their target of 214.</p> <p>Tom Bailey finished with career-best figures of career 11 for 110 in <strong>Lancashire</strong>’s 184-run victory against Kent, after their batters came out swinging to set up a declaration before lunch. <strong>Kent</strong> were quickly in trouble at 10 for three, and Washington Sundar contributed three for 24 with his off-spin to help wrap up the game in the afternoon.</p> <p>A bold teatime declaration from <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> – and 10 wickets in the match for Zafar Gohar – failed to bring their first victory of the season as <strong>Northamptonshire</strong> delivered a thrilling run-chase to reach their 202-run target with two wickets remaining.</p> <p>There were high-scoring draws in the Division One game at Chelmsford – where <strong>Somerset</strong> racked up 605 for six declared against <strong>Essex</strong> and Tom Banton became the first concussion substitute to score a first-class century – and in <strong>Durham</strong>’s Division Two game against <strong>Middlesex</strong>.</p> <p>The other two matches in Division Two were over by tea. With the ball still moving at Trent Bridge, Ollie Robinson and Bradley Currie nipped out the <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> tail early – but not before they had an unassailable lead of 398. Dane Paterson and James Pattinson then picked up where they had left off on days one and two, bowling <strong>Sussex</strong> out for 142, one fewer than their first-innings total.</p> <p>And Anuj Dal added a maiden first-class five-fer to his second-innings century as <strong>Derbyshire</strong> took the five remaining wickets needed to ease them to a 98-run win over <strong>Worcestershire</strong>. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T18:04:16.756Z\">at 7.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62e2be3b8f08c001473265c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T16:51:27.701Z\">5.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>I’m currently writing up for the paper</strong> but for those still keeping an eye, Northants now need only 33 runs off the final 10 overs with five wickets in hand.

Only Marcus Harris provided the kind of score Gloucestershire needed and at 135 for five, they still trail by 27 runs.</p> <p><strong>Warwickshire</strong> had a good day against <strong>Surrey </strong>despite losing early wickets. They recovered from seven for two to 270 for four, Sam Hain and Will Rhodes ending the day with an unbroken partnership of 127, Warwickshire’s lead 207.</p> <p><strong>Somerset</strong> saved the follow-on against <strong>Essex’</strong>s 505 for nine declared, although the joy of Matt Renshaw’s century was tempered by concern for captain Tom Abell, who retired hurt on 90. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/somerset\">Somerset</a> will resume on 359 for 3.</p> <p>In Division Two <strong>Middlesex</strong> kept their heads and compiled a patient response to <strong>Durham</strong>’s 421 for seven declared.

Sunak’s team vowed to stop councils appealing to the Planning Inspectorate to declassify patches of green belt land by updating their local plans. He pledged to end this practice by updating the National Planning Policy Framework, and scrapping the possibility of “inappropriate” development on the green belt “in very special circumstances”.</p> <p>The promise drew ire from Robert Colvile, who helped co-author the December 2019 Conservative manifesto and runs the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank set up by Margaret Thatcher. He said Sunak’s and Truss’s housing plans “pander to the fantasy that we can build all the houses we need on brownfield far away from where any Tory voters might see it”.</p> <p>The green belt has reduced by only 194 sq km since 2014 and at current rates it would take a millennium to be covered, according to Colvile. He added: “Britain has a housing crisis. It is crippling our economy. It is blighting the lives of a generation. Yet more nimbyism is emphatically not the answer.”</p> <p>Other libertarian thinktanks condemned the move. The Institute for Economic Affairs said it would “flush aspiration down the drain” and that planning restrictions “significantly push up the cost of living, while making homeownership unattainable, forcing people into lower-paying jobs and increasing commute times and pollution”. The Adam Smith Institute also said building homes where people want to live and work was “vital if we want to turbo-charge growth and reduce the cost of living”.</p> <p>Giles Wilkes, a former special adviser to Theresa May, called it a “pretty desperate and regressive move”.</p> <p>The Conservative leader of Swindon council, David Renard, opposed Sunak’s move. He said: “There is a consensus that the country needs to build 300,000 homes per year and that we are currently short of building those numbers.</p> <p>“Any centrally imposed numbers or locations on each local authority are not welcome as it is for councils to determine what the housing need is in their areas and to decide where best to locate those new homes.”</p> <p>However, Johnson’s proposed planning reforms that threatened green belt were “clearly a key factor in the loss of Chesham and Amersham to the Lib Dems” in June 2021, said Martin Tett, Tory leader of Buckinghamshire council, who added that Sunak’s pledge would be “very welcome to local members”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>CPRE, the countryside charity, calculated that more than 250,000 homes are currently proposed to be built on land removed from the green belt – more than four times as many as in 2013 – and said “piece by piece, local authorities are eating into protected countryside, using blunt, numerical targets that fail to deliver affordable and social housing”.</p> <p>Tom Fyans, its director of campaigns and policy, said: “Applications to change green belt boundaries in order to release land for housing have soared since 2013. This is despite the pressing need to revitalise our countryside so that it can suck up carbon, boost wildlife and provide much-needed space for recreation in nature.

His bosses need to listen","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>When the most senior figure in Britain’s defence and security establishment warns of the increased risk of accidental nuclear war, the rest of us should pay attention. Even today, when security chiefs speak more often in public than they once did, they still ration their pronouncements. So when the UK’s national security adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/breakdown-of-communication-higher-risk-of-nuclear-conflict-with-china-or-russia-adviser-warns\" title=\"\">Sir Stephen Lovegrove</a>, speaks in Washington about a breakdown in communications with Russia and China causing an enhanced risk of “rapid escalation to strategic conflict”, as he did this week, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/sir-stephen-lovegrove-speech-at-csis-washington-dc\" title=\"\">those words</a> should be taken very seriously indeed.</p> <p>The increased international danger is starkly obvious. Russia’s deliberate invasion of Ukraine, its use there of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/what-are-hypersonic-missiles-and-why-is-russia-using-them-kinzhal-ukraine\" title=\"\">hypersonic</a> Kinzhal weapons and its threats of further escalation involving its nuclear arsenal add up to the most destabilising repertoire of state-on-state aggression in modern Europe since 1945. In Asia, China’s increasingly bellicose postures over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, its intensive nuclear missile development programmes and its disdain towards arms control agreements raise the stakes much higher. Iran and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-62329125\" title=\"\">North Korea</a>, where Kim Jong-un appears to be preparing the country’s first nuclear test for five years, add further to the current volatility.</p> <p>Sir Stephen warned that what is happening is not a return to the nuclear tensions of the cold war. In those days, he argued, Nato and the Soviet Union by and large understood one another’s military doctrines of deterrence, containment and the avoidance of first nuclear weapon use. That is not the case today. Nuclear doctrine is opaque, and possibly different, in Moscow and Beijing, never mind in Pyongyang. The conditions for instability are therefore greater, either through deliberate acts or miscalculations. Although Sir Stephen did not say so, this environment could trigger a flawed and fateful western response, not just an act of aggression by one of the west’s adversaries.</p> <p>Western faith in dialogue with hostile rivals has been massively damaged by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A similar confrontation with China over Taiwan would shatter confidence still further. But Sir Stephen is right to say that all sides must continue to look for ways of conducting dialogue. Some foundations are better than none at all. For that reason alone, it is helpful that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-looks-tamp-down-taiwan-tension-during-china-xi-call-2022-07-28/\" title=\"\">Joe Biden and Xi Jinping</a> were holding their first conversation in many months on Thursday. The expected start of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference in New York <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/conferences/npt2020\" title=\"\">next week</a> is potentially another confidence-building development in a crucial area. In spite of all the obvious difficulties, arms control remains an indispensable means of tackling the current volatility.</p> <p>The key role in the west will continue to be played by the United States. But Britain is not currently doing its bit. Boris Johnson prefers to grandstand as a fancy dress war leader. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/foreign-office-not-regained-global-footing-under-liz-truss-report-finds\" title=\"\">Liz Truss</a> is doing a Margaret Thatcher tribute act in the hope of becoming his successor. Rishi Sunak is afraid of saying anything for fear of the Tory right. This week, though, the Commons <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98db636b-9b25-48fc-9fd0-e6a773345993\" title=\"\">defence committee</a> accused the government of being “arrogant and unwilling to learn the lessons” of its defence errors, including in Ukraine, while an <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/How-should-the-foreign-office-change-now.pdf\" title=\"\">Institute for Government</a> report describes the Foreign Office as understaffed, with low morale and expertise on Russia continuing to be downgraded. Sir Stephen Lovegrove’s Washington speech may be a welcome piece of strategic thinking at the heart of government. But the people who most need to get his message are the British ministers for whom he works.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

\n<p>Campaign themes of climate, integrity and women featured heavily in the first speeches of new independent MPs – often held together by the idea that local representation trumps party politics in

murky mess of factionalism and dark political tactics”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40e89097e127ed5cd4902ab5a6159f0f50bdf3c7\"> \n <img

whom her electorate is named, Daniel noted that Goldstein had rejected party politics, describing it in the early 20th century as “a system that is entirely out of date … [and] a cumbersome, unbusinesslike method of running the country”.</p> \n<p>Daniel, a former ABC reporter, spoke about her personal experience of “climate-related disasters” including “the scenes in Tacloban [in the Philippines], flattened by a storm surge that destroyed 90% of the city … bodies in the streets, cars in trees, giant boats atop buildings … and, amid the rubble, the shattered lives of residents”.</p> \n<p>This, she said, was “a turning point for me, a realisation of the impact climate change and its increasingly unmanageable weather events would have on communities”.</p> \n<ul> \n

For us to achieve our goal of well below 2C of warming, we need all sectors of the economy to pull their weight.”</p> \n<h2>Jacinta Price lobbies against Indigenous Voice</h2> \n<p>The Country Liberal senator Jacinta Price, who described herself as “an empowered Warlpiri Celtic Australian woman”, spoke about the many “acts of symbolism” extended to demonstrate “we are not racist but are overwhelmingly in support of Aboriginal Australia”, from the reconciliation walk across the Sydney harbour bridge to the welcome to country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a957ec6-21dc-436b-b5bd-278eac57dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7wauxCmGSkM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Price said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>I personally have had more than my fill of being symbolically recognised. It has become a racial stereotype that we Australians of Indigenous heritage should belong to and support the Labor party. It was an exchange with the former leader of the Labor party Bill Hayden, who conveyed this very stereotype, that compelled Neville Bonner to confirm his membership within the Liberal party of Australia. Bonner had been handing out how-to-vote cards for a Liberal friend when Hayden exclaimed, ‘What are you doing handing out those how-to-vote cards? We do more for you bloody Aborigines than those bastards do.’ ‘Well,’ Bonner thought, ‘how dare someone come up to me and presume that, because I’m black, I should support a particular party!’</em></p> \n <p><em>It is the same attitude we hear with platitudes of motherhood statements from our now prime minister, who suggests, without any evidence whatsoever, that a voice to parliament bestowed upon us through the virtuous act of symbolic gesture by this government is what is going to empower us. This government has yet to demonstrate how this proposed voice will deliver practical outcomes and unite, rather than drive a wedge further between, Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. And no, prime minister, we don’t need another handout, as you have described the Uluru statement to be. No, we Indigenous Australians have not come to agreement on this statement, as you have also claimed. It would be far more dignifying if we were recognised and respected as individuals in our own right who are not simply defined by our racial heritage but by the content of our character.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Price noted the 47th parliament contained 11 Indigenous representatives, arguing that a voice to parliament amounted to asking “the Australian people to disregard our elected voices and vote yes to apply a constitutionally enshrined advisory body without any detail of what that might in fact entail”.</p> \n<h2>Stephen Bates on LGBTQ+ representation</h2> \n<p>The Greens MP for Brisbane, Stephen Bates, wore a rainbow ibis brooch and spoke about the importance of LGBTQ+ representation.</p> \n<p>Bates paused several times to compose himself as he spoke about his years as a closeted teenager.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddba04d5-066f-484f-9c2c-db77f9a8c9bb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xf7nKO6sNg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Bates said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>I spent much of my teenage years knowing I was gay and doing everything I could to hide it. I told myself I would force myself to get married to a woman, have kids and live in the suburbs. Because that is what I had to do. I was lucky enough to have a very supportive family to come out to but I spent years hiding myself because I could not see anyone in my world that was openly gay. I made a promise to myself once I came out. That if I ever found myself in a public role that I would be open and proud of who I am – hence the rainbow gear. That I would BE that person that I never saw growing up because if I can even help one person out there then this life will have all been worth it.</em></p> \n <p><em>I was lucky enough during the campaign to have received an email from a mother who told me that after receiving a letter from me in her mailbox – that just happened to mention my partner Scott’s name – her 14-year-old son wanted to donate some of his pocket money to our campaign. When she asked him why, he said he had read the letter and wanted me to win. If you cannot see it, you cannot be it. It is not enough to wave a rainbow flag when it is politically convenient, our community deserves tangible legislation that protects us from discrimination, and empowers us to be who we are.”</em></p> \n</blockquote>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/28/australian-wholesale-energy-prices-in-june-quarter-tripled-from-last-year-market-operator-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T17:30:34Z","webTitle":"Australian wholesale energy prices in June quarter tripled from last year, market operator says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/australian-wholesale-energy-prices-in-june-quarter-tripled-from-last-year-market-operator-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/australian-wholesale-energy-prices-in-june-quarter-tripled-from-last-year-market-operator-says","fields":{"headline":"Australian wholesale energy prices in June quarter tripled from last year, market operator says","trailText":"Aemo executive says need for renewables is ‘urgent’ as failing coal-fired power plants and global gas costs cause prices to surge","byline":"Peter Hannam","body":"<p>Wholesale electricity and gas prices tripled in Australia’s main grid in the June quarter compared with a year ago, as failing coal-fired power plants and soaring global gas costs combined to create “unprecedented” market disruptions, the Australian Energy Market Operator said.</p> <p>Aemo’s quarterly market dynamics report found average spot prices for electricity in the national electricity market, which serves eastern Australia, averaged $264 per megawatt-hour across the quarter.

And drag your right foot.”</p> <p>“Push and drag,” I said out loud, hoping that saying the verbs would better help my feet carry out the actions. “Push and drag,” I repeated as I scraped my way gingerly across the non-ice surface.</p> <p>Before long, I was making my way across the rink. Was it skating? No. Was it a kind of movement that had its own grace? Also no. It was a kind of ice … walking.</p> <p>When I showed signs of wobbling, Gabe introduced me to a beginner’s best friend, the wall, which doesn’t mind if you clutch at it while you ice walk.</p> <p>Eventually, I arrived at the far side of the rink. A distance that had taken me minutes to traverse would’ve taken probably 20 seconds to walk, but I was breathless from the effort of staying upright.</p> <p>“Gabe,” I said. “There’s just one problem.

I was exhausted and my centre of gravity was threatening to collapse at any moment. Why did people do this? Was there not enough uncertainty in everyday life that we had to bring a perilous travelling surface and big metal-bladed shoes into our days?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p> I shuffled and pushed the cartoonish penguin along as if performing in a budget version of Happy Feet on Ice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“I’ve got it,” said Gabe.

Though rules surrounding domestic raw milk cheese production changed in 2015, Lansley says, domestic requirements are so strict and costly that only two producers – Pecora Dairy in New South Wales and Prom Country Cheese in Victoria – are making them.</p> <p>Local producers have to send a sample of every batch of raw milk cheese they make to an independent laboratory, which Lansley says is “incredibly expensive”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/stinky-cheese-victorian-producer-receives-9000-fine-for-offensive-sour-milk-odour\">Stinky cheese: Victorian producer receives $9,000 fine for offensive ‘sour milk’ odour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not the case for the British cheeses that will soon arrive on Australian shores. “I’m reasonably confident that we will be taking our case for why Australian cheesemakers should be allowed to make raw milk cheese under the same set of rules as the British cheese packers,” she says.</p> <p>Food Standards Australia New Zealand states that, “vulnerable consumers, such as the elderly, immune-compromised people, children and pregnant women should be aware of heightened risks associated with raw milk.

These are important biographical notes, because this book is about all those qualifiers that not only make the author who she is, but root the overall story and guide its purpose.</p> <p>Part memoir, part bush guide and customs manual, this is a book to lean into and take time with. Foremost, this is a story to learn from. In her introduction, Dank calls it “a strange kind of letter, written to my place”, and yet that strange weaving back and forth through time and dimension adds to the reader’s experience.</p> <p>We Come With This Place is a jewel of a book, one Australians in particular ought to read and refer to. In this way, it belongs alongside iconic desert memoirs, like Ninu <em>– </em>Grandmother’s Law, by Nura Nungalka Ward, about the life of a Yankunytjatjara woman from the Central Desert; and Two Sisters, the story of Walmajarri siblings Ngarta and Jukuna leaving the Great Sandy Desert.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/04/witty-poetic-beautifully-written-the-best-australian-books-out-in-july\">Witty, poetic, beautifully written: the best Australian books out in July</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dank takes her time at the opening of the story. She tells you about the land she grew up on – a character in itself, and all its dust and broken rock – but that’s just a small part of the whole: there’s so much more to that stretch of country in far-west Queensland, across the Barkly Tableland and to the Gulf of Carpentaria. She was born the black kid of a black stockman, which is an omnipresent fact in her family’s lives, and the threat of Bjelke-Petersen’s Queensland in the 1950s and 60s hangs overhead. The invisible menace is wrought in the imagery of a sudden locust cloud that engulfs their van out to Oban station, and the fish-filled sky that rains writhing perch all over Camooweal’s barren streets.</p> <p>There is a heaviness felt throughout the book, of being stolen, going missing, and accidental death too – Dank’s was a childhood of discovery and keen observation, both of the beauty and the brutality of rural Australian life. Hungry and thirsty people and animals litter the pages; the emancipated cattle gathering around a dwelling, or the extreme rationing of fresh water.</p> <p>This is also the story of family – of Dank’s, of her siblings, her parents, her grandparents and her ancestors through time; of Bungmaji and the three Mararamana, the water women, and others. Many stories centre on the fascination, forgiveness and adoration of a troubled parent. Notably of Dank’s father, Soda, whose story follows the timeless tracks as he escapes station owners and mission priests, and traverses hot country with a small stone or hard seed where “the presence of the foreign body produced water in his mouth”. We see him as he dances, jokes with his children, works endlessly, and suffers too. There’s his reunion with his birth mother, Lucy, and the unspeakable crimes he witnesses in that moment before they are separated once again.</p> <p>Dank is particularly skilled at showing the outback through children’s eyes and hearts: the magical fish, the things that can poison, the mangled yellow bodies of grasshoppers, the farming accidents – in this case, a man sucking the tip of a carbine light, and ending up “without his brain”. The red-meat ant bite and the unexpected and confusing kindness of white strangers are stories told side-by-side; everything, it seems, has beauty and pain intertwined. There’s the food and drink that binds time, place and joy into their broken hearts – the story of the conkerberries (bush plum), <em>mamugujama</em> in Gudanji language, “so favoured by us all, including the turkeys”. And the gorgeous story of Dank’s grandfather plucking five perch from a secret hole in the desert, where she discovers “how we could take fish from cold water in arid places”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/22/enclave-by-claire-g-coleman-review-why-shouldnt-we-make-a-utopia\">Enclave by Claire G Coleman review – why shouldn’t we make a utopia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are quiet revelations found in fresh and saltwater, and the melding of each in her marriage to a white fella, and in returning with her adult children to country where her son is so eager to remove his shoes, for his feet to breathe on the bank; as he puts it, “my feet have felt all those things here before”.</p> <p>In the end, Dank reckons with the violence that was never meant to enter her family tree, but did, and she overcomes it. It’s as if these enormous heartbreaks have lodged in her own mouth as a child, unwilling to say so many things aloud.

I drove in, in my own car, got up on stage and left,” he says.</p> <p>When Jamieson says the event was “a little bit tricky”, he is being diplomatic. “I was just ducking and weaving, getting up to do the best job I could possibly do. It was hectic but I just kept my eye on the prize. We got it across the line, I think. But if you went there as an 18-year-old and that was your first festival experience, you would be battle-hardened.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/22/i-got-sick-of-talking-about-myself-spacey-jane-is-back-with-music-for-the-covid-generation\">‘I got sick of talking about myself’: Spacey Jane is back with music for the Covid generation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jamieson, 45, wears a few battle scars of his own. Grinspoon have been active for 27 years since forming in Lismore, northern New South Wales. There were seven albums – the latest being 2012’s Black Rabbits – before the band took a break, reuniting for tours with Cold Chisel in 2015 and supporting a 20th-anniversary reissue of their debut album, Guide to Better Living, in 2017.</p> <p>Now Jamieson is releasing his debut solo album, Somebody Else.He notes that Silverchair’s Daniel Johns, the Living End’s Chris Cheney and the Sleepy Jackson’s Luke Steele have all done the same in 2022: “Look at all these alt-90s kids coming through with their adult contemporary hoo-ha!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f17e9dfbe8dad5b905b05b17457ee24bee124a08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f17e9dfbe8dad5b905b05b17457ee24bee124a08/148_180_1101_1868/589.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Jamieson\" width=\"589\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I just had to, for want of a better word, purge.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Laidlaw</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This sort of self-deprecation comes naturally to Jamieson. He doesn’t love talking himself up, something he again puts down to stereotypical Generation X reticence. But “adult contemporary” makes Somebody Else – recorded and produced with Holy Holy’s Oscar Dawson – sound like a lot less fun than it is. It’s a hoo-ha all right, but the emphasis is on bright, inventive, hooky pop.</p> <p>It might surprise fans (and non-fans) of Grinspoon’s heavier material – and he might give himself a bit more credit, too. There are just eight songs on Somebody Else, written over a decade. Many more hit the cutting-room floor. “I’m my hardest marker, so I’m really tough on material,” he says. “To get those eight songs together was pretty tricky.”</p> <p>He confesses to anxiety about releasing a solo album: “When you’re doing something on your own, you don’t really have a fall guy to say, ‘That’s a terrible idea.’ They’ve been my songs for so long. I would play them live and no one would know whose they were.” There’s that self-deprecation again. “And pretty soon they’ll be everyone’s.”</p> <p>In 2017 and 2018 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/27/american-idiot-review-green-days-rock-opera-premieres-in-australia-with-a-trumpian-twist\">Jamieson played the role of St Jimmy</a> in the Australian stage production of Green Day’s American Idiot. “I learned so much about work ethic, and taking a bit more more pride in what I do,” he says. “You know, as a slacker Gen Xer you’re like, ‘whatever,’ but theatre’s not like that. Everything’s like, ‘YEEEEAAAAHHH!”</p> <p>Singing night after night forced Jamieson to take better care of his voice, and he paid more attention to stagecraft. “I started to put a bit more thought into what I do and where I move on stage – more theatrics, more costumes and just fun things I didn’t think about when I was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wGnNPIu9Uc\">singing on Recovery in 1997</a>.”</p> <p>It came through in Grinspoon’s shows, and the band entered a studio in March 2020, the month that everything changed – but it’s unlikely anything would have eventuated from those recordings anyway. “It wasn’t really gelling,” Jamieson says. “I had these songs on the bubble already, and I didn’t want to force this stuff on Grinspoon if they didn’t want to release it.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrojEnpHGsc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CrojEnpHGsc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Somebody Else’s title track is a good example of a song that might not have worked with the band. He describes it as “shiny” – and there was no wish to darken it. It opens with the chorus. “I can’t think of a song in Grinspoon’s repertoire over 25 years that opens with a chorus. I was trying to think about songs upside down.”</p> <p>But Grinspoon will carry on. “I love the band so much, and we have been very fortunate to play to so many people and to have the back catalogue that we do, and for people to still respond to it in such a beautiful way,” he says. “I just couldn’t write any new Grinspoon stuff without getting this out of the way.

But medicines can have different effects and efficacy depending on ethnicity, pregnancy, gender and other attributes.</p> <p>In order to see how these often life-saving drugs affect people from different groups, data needs to be drawn from multiple similar studies of the drug to improve the overall sample size, and so stronger findings can be determined. These pooled studies are known as systematic reviews or meta-analyses.</p> <p>If the trial data isn’t available to independent researchers, this can’t be done, which has implications for health equity, Modi said.</p> <p>“It means we can’t always answer questions like: ‘Is this medicine safe to use in females, or is it safe and effective in Asians or in elderly individuals?’” he said.</p> <p>“Pharmaceutical companies are not going to provide this data to other pharmaceutical companies because of competition, so this work has to be done by independent researchers. But it can’t be done without the data and transparency.”</p> <p>Modi said the most common reason provided by pharmaceutical companies for the lack of transparency was that longterm follow-up data was still being collected.</p> <p>“Ongoing follow-up is of course needed, but it should not hinder the release of the initial data that shows the efficacy of the drug in the first place,” he said.</p>

A third more children have become eligible for extra funding support over the past three years and the number now stands at 473,000 children.</p> <p>The CCN is warning that the government’s planned <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ambitious-reform-for-children-and-young-people-with-send\">SEN reforms</a> later this year – which will try to reduce the “postcode lottery” in services and make the system less adversarial – will not be enough to plug the deficit that could rise to £3.6bn without action.</p> <p>Keith Glazier, a councillor and spokesperson for children’s services at CCN, said many council leaders viewed the debts as “unmanageable”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/21/the-guardian-view-on-tory-plans-for-send-cuts-the-wrong-move\">The Guardian view on Tory plans for Send cuts: the wrong move | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Glazier said: “Over the last five years, councils have not shirked from taking hard decisions on SEN support in order to try to make services financially sustainable, but we are swimming against the tide. Rising demand each year has meant our deficits have increased six-fold since 2018.”</p> <p>The CCN is calling for the government to write off the deficit to avoid councils being forced to make “catastrophic financial decisions” or face possible insolvency once the government lifts its current temporary ringfencing of SEN deficits, potentially in a year’s time. This would give local authorities time for the reforms to be implemented, enabling them to start on “a blank slate”, Glazier added.</p> <p>The reason for the deficit is that more children became eligible for education, health and care plans after legislative changes in 2014, at the same time as support for SEN pupils in mainstream schools has fallen and specialist schools have closed, hitting rural councils especially hard, said the CCN.</p> <p>In its response to the government consultation on planned reforms to the SEN system, the CCN said the proposals could help with the pressures councils are facing due to increased demand, but these would not be “an overnight fix” and would not erase the deficits that have built up over the last five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government’s reforms package includes £1.4bn for councils to pay for new SEN school places and improve existing provision, and £70m for broader reforms aimed at standardising support across the UK.

In total they smuggled more than £100m of dirty cash out of the UK to Dubai between April 2019 and November 2020.</p> <p>He was sentenced to nine years and seven months in prison, after the “considerable network” of criminals was exposed following an arrest at Heathrow airport in October 2020.</p> <p>Couriers received £3,000-£8,000 a time. A total of 83 trips were made, with couriers carrying as much as £500,000 in each suitcase. The cases were packed with coffee grounds or air fresheners in an attempt to fool sniffer dogs.</p> <p>Alfalasi’s firm, Omnivest Gold Trading, was used as cover for the cash declarations in Dubai. The dirty money came from sources including organised crime and drug dealing.</p> <p>Judge Davis, at Isleworth crown court in west London, said: “There is no doubt that this was a considerable network under your charge, not your sole charge, you were a principal, but it is clear that there were others involved.

She admitted smuggling another £3.5m out of the country and was given a three-year-prison sentence.</p> <p>About a month later, a Czech national, Zdenek Kamaryt, 39, was held as he tried to board a flight from Heathrow to Dubai with £1.3m of cash in his bags. He was jailed for two years and 10 months.</p> <p>Alfalasi personally carried a total of £6m on 10 trips before recruiting the network of mules. He was arrested at a Belgravia flat on 14 December last year while visiting London.</p> <p>John Werhun, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This is one of the largest money-laundering cases the CPS has ever prosecuted to date. A colossal amount of dirty money, totalling £104m, was transported to Dubai under Alfalasi’s instructions.”</p> <p>The prosecutor, Julian Christopher QC, said Alfalasi recruited couriers, “typically young people, attracted by money”, to travel on business class flights, making use of the additional luggage allowance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The suitcases, weighing up to 40kg, were also packed with mouthwash and coat hangers in an attempt to fool the X-ray machines. The couriers declared the money to customs on arrival in Dubai, before returning home with the empty bags shortly after.</p> <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was believed to be the biggest cash money-laundering conspiracy brought to justice in the UK. The senior investigating officer, Ian Truby, said: “Cash is the lifeblood of organised crime groups, which they reinvest into activities such as drug trafficking, which fuels violence and insecurity around the world.”</p> <p>Alfalasi’s couriers included Nicola Esson, 55, from Leeds, who was arrested after NCA raids in May 2021, and Muhammad Ilyas, 29, from Slough, who was apprehended in February 2020.

The theory is that raising the number of two-year-olds who can be cared for by a single adult from four to five will make nursery places cheaper. But this only works if adults agree to do more work for the same money – and if adding extra children to a setting does not increase costs other than pay.</p> <p>Given that the early years sector already has some of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/low-pay-commission-report-2021\" title=\"\">lowest pay rates</a>, the proposal is insulting and unjust to the women who make up more than 95% of staff – as well as unlikely to deliver what ministers want. A suggestion from the Conservative leadership contender Liz Truss that parents with caring responsibilities <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-22/maternal-rights-campaigners-attack-truss-childcare-tax-plan\" title=\"\">could qualify for a new tax break</a> is concerning for a different reason – namely that it would incentivise mothers to give up paid work.</p> <p>The fact that ministers can’t come up with anything more original, a decade after Ms Truss first proposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/06/nick-clegg-childcare-standards-liz-truss\" title=\"\">alter staffing ratios</a>, shows the extent to which the governing party is stuck, with deregulation its only trick. The reality is that policymakers need to get a much firmer grip on what is going on in this crucially important area. Even before Covid pushed some providers out of business, and mothers out of work due to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/feb/28/mums-women-coronavirus-covid-home-schooling-inequality\" title=\"\">impossibility of fitting childcare around a job</a> in pandemic conditions, there was a great deal to be worried about.</p> <p>What has happened over the past 20 years is financialisation. As in some other public services, particularly social care, the nursery sector has been targeted by private equity and is now characterised by debt, lack of transparency, complex tax arrangements in multiple jurisdictions, and splits between holding and operating companies.</p> <p>Why profit-making businesses were ever deemed the most appropriate providers of care and early years education is obscure. This is the opposite approach from that taken to schools. But what is now under way in England is the transformation of a sector that was previously a patchwork of small and larger businesses, including self-employed childminders, and non-profit and state nurseries. While estimates vary due to gaps in data, up to 69% of early years places are now run by businesses, some of which pay little or no tax. Research shows that they <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/jan/nursery-sector-risks-being-damaged-large-corporate-takeovers\" title=\"\">tend to pay staff less</a> than voluntary nurseries, seek less involvement from parents, and show less commitment to principles of inclusivity. One provider took more money out of its charitable foundation over the course of a year than it put in.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/13/uk-childcare-costs-soar-by-more-than-2000-in-a-decade-tuc-says\" title=\"\">childcare costs</a> among the highest in Europe, and salaries of nursery workers too low, the current system is stacked in favour of private-equity owners and no one else. Over time, it requires an overhaul. Right now, ministers should insist on transparency with regard to public funds (the government spends about <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/jan/nursery-sector-risks-being-damaged-large-corporate-takeovers\" title=\"\">£3.9bn a year on early years provision</a> in England, plus £2bn via the tax and benefits systems) and make community involvement a condition of operating. Funding must also be increased to cover the cost of what are supposed to be free part-time places – but for which providers must currently cross-subsidise or seek top-ups. Talk of relaxing ratios, or a tax break for parents, is inadequate.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She said: “Stripping has allowed me to have a flexible enough schedule to pursue my dream career whilst simultaneously enabling me to live a comfortable life.</p> <p>“Closing Urban Tiger and Central Chambers [the second club] would push me back into poverty, precarious and underpaid work – or I will most likely keep on dancing in Bristol, but in riskier spaces where there will be no security staff and no CCTV. I find it particularly cruel to push a workforce that is predominantly female into poverty.”</p> <p>A second performer, Layla, said: “Dancing has given me financial freedom,” adding that she had been sexually harassed not while working at lapdancing clubs but in other venues on nights out.</p> <p>Others had called for Bristol to be brave and ban all SEVs. Nick Gazzard, founder of <a href=\"https://holliegazzard.org/\">the Hollie Gazzard Trust</a>, which campaigns on violence against women, said: “We need the city council to lead the way in promoting mutual respect between boys and girls, men and women, and to help in educating young people on how to achieve healthy relationships, rather than licensing the objectification of women.”</p> <p>The police and crime commissioner for Avon and Somerset police, Mark Shelford, also backed the idea of a ban, but members from all five political parties represented on the council voted against it.</p> <p>The Labour chair of the licensing committee, Marley Bennett, said the city had to do everything it could to fight violence against women and girls and acknowledged the industry was about sexually arousing men. He said he had suffered sleepless nights over the issue but concluded it was better to have regulated clubs rather than lapdancing being driven underground.</p> <p>Bennett continued: “These are working-class women performers who would be losing their livelihoods during a cost-of-living crisis. I’m a trade unionist. They have a profession they say they want to maintain.”</p> <p>One of the biggest rounds of applause from the dancers came for Green councillor Guy Poultney, who criticised some of those who said they were representing the interests of the performers.</p> <p>He said: “Some of the voices we have heard are sometimes advancing arguments we should discount the voices of some women in order to empower them and to restrict their choices in the name of equality and take away their jobs for their own good.”</p> <p>The only committee member supporting a ban, Labour’s Philippa Hulme, said having lapdancing clubs did not sit well with the image of progressive Bristol. She said: “There’s a vast weight of evidence that visiting these venues leads customers to objectify women and leads to misogyny.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/28/iran-may-eventually-get-its-way-in-protracted-power-struggle-in-iraq","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T17:07:25Z","webTitle":"Iran may eventually get its way in protracted power struggle in Iraq","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/iran-may-eventually-get-its-way-in-protracted-power-struggle-in-iraq","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/28/iran-may-eventually-get-its-way-in-protracted-power-struggle-in-iraq","fields":{"headline":"Iran may eventually get its way in protracted power struggle in Iraq","trailText":"Analysis: Kurdish officials are considering allying with Iranian interests to finally form a government in Baghdad","byline":"Martin Chulov Middle East correspondent","body":"<p>A parliament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/hundreds-of-protesters-storm-iraq-parliament-in-support-of-cleric-moqtada-al-sadr\">besieged by protesters</a>, a country adrift nine months after an election, a feud between domestic blocs and Iranian proxies: for many Iraqis, the latest political crisis is nothing new.</p> <p>But to many observers this standoff appears more complex and protracted than most over the more than two decades of efforts to root a democratic state in Iraq.

In post-election horse trading, Sadr hoped to form a government in the 329-seat parliament alongside Sunni parties.</p> <p>But as attempts to name a president – the first step in the process – failed, the Kurdish region’s prime minister, Masrour Barzani, began to moot a new decentralised confederation model that would bleed power from Baghdad and give Kurds and other ethno-sectarian constituencies more power over their own affairs.</p> <p>Barzani told the London-headquartered thinktank Chatham House in April that confederation could be a solution for all Iraqis. His remarks were a pointed break from the buy-in to a central model in which Washington has, until recently, remained invested since the US military ousted Saddam Hussein nearly 20 years ago.</p> <p>US interest in defending Iraq’s democracy considerably waned over the first year of the Biden administration, leading Kurdish officials to consider allying with Iranian interests to finally form a government in Baghdad.</p> <p>One senior Kurdish official said Tehran had the edge on Washington in Iraq. “There is a constant that will continue to outlive and outmanoeuvre the US. It was a predictable and preventable outcome. It took Sadr 10 months to accept it. He called it quits because he realised what many still refuse to accept: Iran’s here to stay.”</p> <p>Sadr, the biggest winner in the election last October, ordered his MPs to resign from their positions in the spring, but remains the person most able to mobilise the Iraqi street. Wednesday was a pointed reminder of his powers, as hundreds of his supporters danced and sang in parliament after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/hundreds-of-protesters-storm-iraq-parliament-in-support-of-cleric-moqtada-al-sadr\">storming Baghdad’s high-security green zone</a>.</p> <p>Sadr had mobilised his followers to protest against the nomination by an Iran-aligned group of the former minister and regional governor Mohammed al-Sudani for prime minister. Though no longer in parliament, the controversial cleric appears insistent on naming a new leader.</p> <p>Iranian blocs took devastating losses in the election, which would have greatly reduced Tehran’s powers in the legislature and in other Iraqi institutions.

Most evenings I had a hot water bottle and painkillers to sleep, and I was unable to walk far or bend down, leading to other aches and pains, and continued fatigue. I am only now able to go on long walks and do weights again.</p> <p>Other friends in their 40s who had the AstraZeneca vaccine have had similar problems; those offered Pfizer or Moderna did not.

Will we see it as an integral part of the terrestrial TV monoculture? Will we scratch our heads and wonder why we spent such a long time in thrall to a show in which very little happened? Will we just remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/bouncers-dream-and-gorillagrams-an-oral-history-of-neighbours-the-worlds-silliest-sunniest-show\">Bouncer’s dream</a> and discard the rest?</p> <p>I suspect will we see Neighbours as a star-maker supreme. The show has probably produced more megastars than every other soap opera combined. You have already heard a ton about Margot Robbie, Liam Hemsworth, Russell Crowe and all the other Neighbours actors who rocketed to international stardom after appearing on the show. Here, though, are some actors who had more interesting post-Neighbours experiences.</p> <h2>Shane Connor (Joe Scully, 1999-2004)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8992700c54df39d3087c264fe6c1a8eed23d2e8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8992700c54df39d3087c264fe6c1a8eed23d2e8d/69_144_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shane Connor arrive for the recording of the second series of the Australian version of Hells Kitchen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shane Connor arrive for the recording of the second series of the Australian version of Hells Kitchen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Independent/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Connor has kept in regular work since leaving Neighbours – appearing in the Australian TV drama City Homicide and the horror film Wolf Creek 2 – the most interesting part of his career was his departure from Ramsay Street. Connor was fired for “negligence and misconduct” after he overcame an amphetamine problem. He took the show to court. The judge ruled he had been wrongfully dismissed and awarded him the equivalent of £130,000 in damages.</p> <h2>Dan Falzon (Rick Alessi, 1992-1995)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f536782d6b638b6becb94befaa326251306b126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f536782d6b638b6becb94befaa326251306b126/0_29_1778_1066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Falzon (2nd right) in pop band Milk at Planet Hollywood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Falzon (2nd right) in pop band Milk at Planet Hollywood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Floppy-haired heart-throb Falzon has watched his career zigzag all over the place since quitting Neighbours in the mid-1990s, continuing to act while forming a band with his brother. Until recently employed as a paramedic in Alice Springs, Falzon is also the managing director of Earth Sanctuary, an eco-tourism and astronomy business. A decade ago, he was also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOXZ3QELMek\">a YouTuber</a>; he uploaded a video where an alien welcomes you to the Galactic Federation of Light. </p> <h2>Elaine Smith (Daphne Clarke, 1985-1988)</h2> <p>One of the original stars of Neighbours, Smith’s character was killed in a car crash at the height of her popularity. She had a successful acting career post-Neighbours, scoring roles in the TV dramas The Flying Doctors and State Coroner, but said that she struggled with the pressures of fame. In 2017, she was pictured outside a Sydney school, having retrained as a teacher.</p> <h2>Alan Dale (Jim Robinson, 1985-1993)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0d4aa08a544d1974f2abfcb7b3717df8b3956be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0d4aa08a544d1974f2abfcb7b3717df8b3956be/0_2_4131_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Alan Dale in the dressing room backstage at the Palace Theatre, London ahead of playing King Arthur in Monty Python’s Spamalot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Alan Dale in the dressing room backstage at the Palace Theatre, London ahead of playing King Arthur in Monty Python’s Spamalot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have tried not to include many figures who continued to act after Neighbours, but Alan Dale deserves to be singled out for special attention. Prolific beyond words, there was a time when Dale would appear on television every single time that a prestigious drama needed a mildly threatening authority figure. He was Charles Widmore on Lost. He was the vice-president on 24. He was on The West Wing, and Ugly Betty, and NCIS, and CSI, and JAG. He was even in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Dale has perhaps the best-furrowed field of any Neighbours actor.</p> <h2>Craig McLachlan (Henry Ramsay, 1987-1989)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f00955be50c67b61f91ee75d75d56c38b06aa4db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f00955be50c67b61f91ee75d75d56c38b06aa4db/0_16_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Craig McLachlan arrives at the 2015 Sydney Theatre Awards in Sydney, Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig McLachlan arrives at the 2015 Sydney Theatre Awards in Sydney, Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Arnold/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After leaving Neighbours, McLachlan instantly had a No 2 UK hit with his song Mona, although, unlike some of his co-stars, he would prove to be a one-hit wonder. Nevertheless, he continued to act regularly on television and on stage, being nominated for a Logie award as recently as 2016. However, in 2018, an investigation revealed that he had been subject to complaints from female co-stars. Victoria Police charged him with one count of common assault, eight counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted indecent assault, although he was acquitted of all charges in 2020. He has not acted since the allegations were made and has not updated his social media since May.</p> <h2>Rebecca Ritters (Hannah Martin, 1992-1999)</h2> <p>Finally, my favourite post-Neighbours story. Ritters joined the show when she was eight and left when she was 15. She spent her subsequent years, like most teenagers, trying to find her place in the world.

The global crash, the pandemic and now war and the cost of living crisis have shown us our economic and political systems are not fit for such chaotic times. The tide is now going out on one era, and the Labour party seems to have been left behind. It appears perpetually out of step, most recently when it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer\">sacked MP Sam Tarry</a>, the now former Labour transport spokesperson who dared to stand on a picket line with striking workers, and lost his job shortly afterwards.</p> <p>Labour in its post-Corbyn period is desperately searching for a playbook that will win it the next election, or at least keep it electorally afloat. But the only one to hand is apparently New Labour’s – and they offer a desiccated, joyless, and stripped bare version of that more interesting but long-gone moment.</p> <p>Keir Starmer’s game isn’t to inspire with hope and a grand vision, but to play a glorified game of whack-a-mole with every possible Tory attack line. He promises, for example, “<a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-vows-no-magic-27563746\">no magic money tree economics</a>”, no nationalisation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/starmer-says-he-wont-be-ideological-labour-renationalisation-row\">public services</a>, that Labour won’t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/01/labour-never-strike-deal-snp-keir-starmer-pledge\">talk to the SNP</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/18/starmer-rules-out-even-informal-post-election-deal-with-lib-dems\">deal with Liberal Democrats</a>. And the unions must be held at arm’s length so as not to frighten the horses of the right or some fictional middle England swing voter. When really, even the more conservative voters he hopes to reach are concerned about wages and the cost of living.</p> <p>Labour puts itself in a terrible position. It won’t spend its way out of the cost of living crisis and the recession to come because it’s busy tying itself up in orthodox Treasury knots, spewing out the line that governments are like households and can’t spend what they don’t have. Which is absurd, first, because households often spend what they don’t have, not least through mortgages. Governments can both borrow like that (with better rates and terms) or they can print money – as they did throughout Covid. But Labour is determinedly shutting this door, play-acting at what it thinks political grownups do.</p> <p>It is also shutting the door on one of the best solutions to the cost of living crisis. One of the jobs of a union is to negotiate better wages from company profits, and it’s clear people are willing to go on strike rather than suffer eye-watering real wage cuts that leave their families short. It is the job of the party of labour to back them. To be clear, none of this is some Scargillite game of revolutionary toy soldiers. This is ordinary union action, using methods – such as strikes – familiar to all and protected by law. Moreover, this is a real-life crisis for millions of scared ordinary people. Labour cannot afford to be seen as anything but on their side.</p> <p>The Starmer project, if we can give it such a grand title, knows how brittle and exposed it is in all this. It won on a Corbynism-without-Corbyn ticket and then ruthlessly and cynically kicked that all away. What matters here isn’t an adherence to Corbyn himself, but an analysis of the current situation, and a set of ideas and movements that stand at least a chance of addressing the age we now live in. Jeremy Corbyn was an implausible leader, but there were genuinely popular ideas and a willingness to take on modern challenges found in his movement. Not least revitalising trade unionism.</p> <p>Enter Tarry, one of the stormtroopers for Corbyn’s leadership and an advocate of Labour backing people who actually labour (in 2010 Tarry and I both worked for the campaigning organisation Compass). This landed him in the crosshairs of the leadership’s panicked attempts to both rid the party of any voices of hope and reason, and pivot back to a sixth-form play of the New Labour era. It will not work.</p> <p>What would work, or at least stand a chance, is to learn the lessons of Joe Biden in the US and Olaf Scholz in Germany, who both embraced the left of their parties and at least enjoyed the electoral spoils. What also works is the way Andy Burnham has used the platform of mayor in Greater Manchester to address the cost of living crisis via ownership and control of the buses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/andy-burnham-cap-greater-manchester-bus-fares-2-pounds\">therefore lower fares</a>. Burnham has also made democracy and proportional representation a first-order issue by saying that whatever we want, we won’t get it until we change the political system. Or the way that Mark Drakeford, the Labour leader of Wales, has put ideas such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/14/wales-to-launch-universal-basic-income-pilot-scheme\">universal basic income</a> on the map.</p> <p>Meanwhile Labour turns its face against the moment. Complacency about a Liz Truss premiership could rebound in the way the left’s complacency about Margaret Thatcher’s election to the Tory leadership did in 1975. Parties have to win office to do anything. But without a purpose, a vision and hope, Labour is doomed to fail<strong> </strong>at that.</p> <p>But that’s not the worst of it. Rachel Wolf, a former Conservative adviser, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-need-next-conservative-leader-rishi-sunak-liz-truss/\">wrote recently</a> about “the spectre of a rise in populism haunting (us)”. If the Tories continue to crash and Labour fails to offer any desirable or feasible alternative, waiting in the wings is something much worse.</p> <p>The choice between a terrible party and a less terrible one is no choice at all – not when the planet burns, and people are starving. Maybe the widespread reaction to Tarry’s sacking will be a wake-up call. It can never be too late.</p> <ul> <li><p>Neal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/28/commonwealth-games-far-from-irrelevant-insist-organisers","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T16:15:06Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games ‘far from irrelevant’, insist organisers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/28/commonwealth-games-far-from-irrelevant-insist-organisers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/28/commonwealth-games-far-from-irrelevant-insist-organisers","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games ‘far from irrelevant’, insist organisers","trailText":"The CGF insists the event is thriving and also said it was working with Tom Daley following his comments on homophobia across the Commonwealth","byline":"Tumaini Carayol in Birmingham","body":"<p>The organisers of the Commonwealth Games have defended its relevance on the eve of the competition, arguing that it continues to thrive.

But what the singer-songwriter was actually trying to convey has been up for debate for the past half-century, with generations of fans and critics dissecting every nuance of its nearly nine-minute runtime. It’s a discussion that has stretched into the current age, with the song, and McLean himself, the subject of the new documentary aptly dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/19/don-mclean-american-pie-documentary-the-day-the-music-died\">The Day the Music Died: American Pie</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/19/don-mclean-american-pie-documentary-the-day-the-music-died\">‘I said, Don, it’s time for you to reveal’: 50 years later, the truth behind American Pie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>American Pie isn’t the only song in the vast history of popular music that has been picked apart word-by-word as if they were biblical text. Examined for double, or even triple, meanings, they’re the smash hits chock-full of metaphors, allusions and allegories that rocked the charts and, as a result, ingrained themselves in culture.</p> <h2><strong>Taylor Swift – All Too Well</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tollGa3S0o8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tollGa3S0o8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It’s the most recent example of a song with more layers than an onion, with fans happily picking apart each piece. The 10-minute version of Taylor Swift’s All Too Well, an epic soliloquy about a relationship that goes south that subsequently resulted in a short film, spurred an avalanche of discussion with Swift’s legion of fans attempting to decode the track line by line. Was the song actually about the star’s real-life relationship with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal? Which lines are fiction and what’s fact? And whatever happened with her infamous red scarf? After all, Swift has built her career on dropping clues, hints and puzzles both in the form of lyrics and promotion to her rabid Swifties. As a result of the hoopla, last autumn the track became the longest-duration No 1 hit in Billboard history.</p> <h2><strong>Don McLean – American Pie</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RciM7P9K3FA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RciM7P9K3FA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>“I wanted to write a song about America, but I didn’t want to write a song about America like anybody ever wrote before,” Don McLean says in the aforementioned documentary, directed by Mark Moormann. McLean did just that, though he didn’t set out to paint a rosy, patriotic picture in the vein of George M Cohan. According to the track’s producer, Ed Freeman: “For me, American Pie is the eulogy for a dream that didn’t take place. We were witness to the death of the American dream.”</p> <p>While its lyrics center on the tragic February 1959 plane crash that took the life of rock’s earliest stars Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Richie Valens, listeners have debated who and what else the song is referring to since the 70s. For starters: no, Janis Joplin wasn’t the “the girl who sang the blues” and Elvis wasn’t the “king” MacLean was talking about. According to Spencer Proffer, the documentary’s producer: “Every time you listen, you think of something else.”</p> <h2><strong>Leonard Cohen – Hallelujah</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrLk4vdY28Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YrLk4vdY28Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ironically the subject of another new documentary in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/29/hallelujah-leonard-cohen-documentary\">Hallelujah: Leonard Cohen, A Journey, A Song</a>, what became Leonard Cohen’s trademark track has captivated listeners thanks to a seemingly holy quality that gives the song a deep resonance. It’s perhaps no surprise then that Cohen first studied poetry and literature before his towering career in music, with the song’s lyrics reading like a rich novel, complete with references to biblical characters (David and the Lord) and modern allusions (including tying oneself to a kitchen chair).</p> <p>It’s all another hotly debated, musical Rorschach test. Christians who have taken the song as their own may be surprised to learn that Cohen was actually deeply passionate about his Jewish faith. “The word Hallelujah appears across religions and faiths,” explained author Alan Light, who wrote a book about the song. “People take what they need from it and what they want it to be. I think that’s why it’s played everywhere from weddings to funerals and births.”</p> <h2><strong>Beyonc</strong><strong>é – Lemonade</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxsmWxxouIM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QxsmWxxouIM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As the globe patiently awaits the release of Beyoncé’s seventh studio album Renaissance this Friday, one can’t help but recall the conversation and speculation around her fifth. Part-confessional therapy session, part-rumination on modern culture, politics and racism, the artistry of 2016’s Lemonade shook the world, with listeners combing over each of its acclaimed 12 songs, lyric by lyric.</p> <p>Conceived as both an audio and visual album, listeners and critics have dissected it all: from the personal allusions (like the mysterious identity of “Becky with the good hair” on Sorry, the woman who allegedly was Jay-Z’s mistress), to its political and social ones (with the anthem exploding the minds of countless political pundits and the song becoming an instant protest anthem as a result). No wonder the layered entirety of Lemonade is still considered the singer’s best.</p> <h2><strong>John Lennon – Imagine</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v27CEFE02Hs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v27CEFE02Hs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of the most acclaimed and often-played songs in music history is also the most widely misunderstood. The most successful single of John Lennon’s solo career, Imagine is played during times of tragedy and triumph and has been discussed and dissected as everything from a patriotic ode and a spiritual testament since its 1971 release. Even President Jimmy Carter went so far to once note: “You hear John Lennon’s song Imagine used almost equally with national anthems.”</p> <p>Carter himself might be surprised to hear that Lennon once described the track in no uncertain terms as, well, downright communist: “‘Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,’ is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I’m not particularly a communist and I do not belong to any movement,” he once said. That didn’t stop the past 50 years of listeners from taking a microscope to potential meanings, or worse, inserting their own. According to Lennon: “The World Church called me once and asked, “Can we use the lyrics to Imagine and just change it to ‘Imagine one religion’?” That showed me they didn’t understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/28/met-officers-in-wayne-couzens-group-joked-about-assaulting-women-court-told","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T16:01:41Z","webTitle":"Met officers in Couzens group joked about assaulting women, court told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/28/met-officers-in-wayne-couzens-group-joked-about-assaulting-women-court-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/28/met-officers-in-wayne-couzens-group-joked-about-assaulting-women-court-told","fields":{"headline":"Met officers in Couzens group joked about assaulting women, court told","trailText":"Prosecutor reads out messages shared by three defendants in WhatsApp chat in 2019","byline":"Ben Quinn","body":"<p>Metropolitan police officers accused of sharing “grossly offensive” messages in a WhatsApp group that included Wayne Couzens joked about beating and sexually assaulting women, raping a colleague and Tasering children, a court has heard.</p> <p>PC Jonathon Cobban, 35, PC William Neville, 33, and Joel Borders, 45, a former officer, listened from the dock as comments they made were read out by the prosecution at Westminster magistrates court.</p> <p>The three are charged with sharing racist and misogynistic messages between 5 April and 9 August 2019 in a WhatsApp group that included them and other officers.<strong> </strong>The posts were discovered in the group after Couzens was arrested for kidnapping, raping and murdering Sarah Everard in March 2021.</p> <p>The messages included one in which Neville told others in the group of a recent shift when he had pinned down a 15-year-old girl, referring to it as a “struggle snuggle”, a remark that prosecutors allege to be the acting out of a rape fantasy.</p> <p>Cobban went on during the same exchange in August 2019 to say that such an approach was “always useful” and that these were “good skills” for a police officer, the court heard.</p> <p>Other comments included Cobban and Borders implying that victims of domestic abuse encouraged the physical and psychological torment to which they were subjected, said Edward Brown QC, prosecuting.</p> <p>“DV victims love it. That’s why they’re repeat victims more often than not,” Cobban allegedly wrote in a message in June 2019.</p> <p>Brown told the court in his opening statement that police officers should represent a safe haven for victims of domestic abuse. Of the comments, he said: “Coming from the mouth of a police officer whose duty is to serve and protect such vulnerable members of society, and whose role ought to be not only to ignore such thinking but actively to work against it, is grossly offensive.”</p> <p>In another message, Borders is accused of anticipating getting access to police firearms and being able to shoot someone in the face, then asking Cobban about what it would be like to use a Taser on someone with Down’s syndrome.</p> <p>Brown said members of the public would look to a police officer for understanding and support, not abuse. “This must be seen in the context of and in combination with a need to uphold public confidence in the police,” he said.</p> <p>Cobban, of Didcot, Oxfordshire, is charged with five counts of sending a grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing message on a public electronic communications network. Neville, of Weybridge, Surrey, is charged with two counts of the same offence, and Borders, of Preston, Lancashire, faces five counts of the same charge. They deny the charges against them.</p> <p>The defendants were part of a “close-knit group” of officers sharing messages on WhatsApp, and there was no evidence that they or any members of the group “called out” or challenged offensive comments, Brown said. The group totalled seven people, five of whom were undertaking Met training, including the three defendants.</p> <p>The defendants had previous experience as officers in the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), and each was a serving student and then probationary police officer in the Met at the time the messages were sent. During 2017, when Cobban was at the CNC, he had volunteered to take on the additional responsibility of being the “race and diversity custodian” for the unit.</p> <p>“Each of the defendants was a serving police officer, training to and employed to protect and support the citizens of a very diverse city,” Brown told the court, adding that each of the messages relating to their charges was plainly grossly offensive by any objective standard.</p> <p>The WhatsApp group included one participant, named as “Kate”, who is currently a police constable with the Met and who undertook training at the same time as the defendants, the court heard.</p> <p>In a message in April 2019 referring to “Kate”, Borders wrote: “She will use me as an example. Lead me on then get me locked up when I rape and beat her! Sneaky bitch.”</p> <p>Other messages included disparaging references to the areas of London such as Hounslow, to which Cobban referred disparagingly, noting the local Somali community and sounds of the Muslim call to prayer. Borders joined in, adding that a similarly diverse area, Feltham, was “worse”.</p> <p>The court heard that in interviews Cobban said his comment about domestic violence victims were “a joke, in very bad taste”. He said a reference to being in Hounslow centre as like “walking along a Dulux colour code” was intended to refer to “the vibrancy of the area”.</p> <p>Borders said his comment about raping and beating “Kate” was meant to be “dark humour” but he did not believe that violence against women or rape was a joke.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/28/mary-earps-business-euro-2022-final-de-gea-england","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T16:00:31Z","webTitle":"Mary Earps ready to do the business in Euros final thanks to De Gea dealings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/mary-earps-business-euro-2022-final-de-gea-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/28/mary-earps-business-euro-2022-final-de-gea-england","fields":{"headline":"Mary Earps ready to do the business in Euros final thanks to De Gea dealings","trailText":"Enterprising goalkeeper has put career in commerce to one side after stunning performances secured England’s No 1 spot","byline":"Louise Taylor","body":"<p>Shortly after the final whistle at Bramall Lane on Tuesday night, Mary Earps received a congratulatory message from David de Gea.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/26/england-sweden-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">England had just crushed Sweden 4-0</a> to reach the final of Euro 2022 but that scoreline could have been very different had Sarina Wiegman’s goalkeeper not contributed some superlative-defying early saves.</p> <p>Although Earps and her men’s counterpart at Manchester United do not train together they are mutually supportive and remain in regular touch. “David’s just messaged me saying congratulations,” she reported, beaming at suggestions that her first save, made with an outstretched left leg to deny Sofia Jakobsson inside the opening 30 seconds, seemed straight out of the De Gea playbook.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/relentless-popp-spearheads-force-of-germany-but-glimpses-of-hope-for-england\">Popp spearheads Germany’s force but glimpses of hope for England | Nick Ames</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’ll take that comparison, no problem at all,” said the 29-year-old, who is unafraid to pick the Spain goalkeeper’s brains. “Me and David speak a little bit.

She also brushed up on German, having acquired some when she was reserve goalkeeper at Wolfsburg during the 2018-2019 season.</p> <p>“I eat, sleep, dream and breathe football,” she has said. “But I’m also fascinated by business.” During the first lockdown, Earps particularly – and typically – enjoyed reading Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. However, at that stage she seemed to have resigned herself to never progressing beyond understudy status in the international goalkeeping hierarchy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c73973d44368709e282cdc9119629a59251a8e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c73973d44368709e282cdc9119629a59251a8e7d/0_82_5115_3069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Earps celebrates England’s third goal against Sweden with Leah Williamson – she made a string of fine saves during the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Earps celebrates England’s third goal against Sweden with Leah Williamson – she made a string of fine saves during the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After making her international debut under Mark Sampson in 2017, she travelled to the 2019 World Cup in France as Phil Neville’s third-choice goalkeeper and arguably rose up the rankings under Wiegman only because of the serious injury that forced Manchester City’s Ellie Roebuck to miss the first half of last season.</p> <p>Once Roebuck recovered, Wiegman went through a spell of rotating her, Aston Villa’s Hannah Hampton and Earps in goal. When the United keeper was confirmed as the first choice for Euro 2022, some critics questioned the England’s manager’s judgment.</p> <p>Earps has confounded them by keeping four clean sheets in five tournament games. Her general excellence was epitomised by the moment in the semi-final when Stina Blackstenius’s shot appeared on an unstoppable trajectory towards the far top corner only for Earps to perform acrobatic wonders and tip it over.</p> <p>At that point it became abundantly clear how far Earps has come since France 2019, when her predominant contribution to England’s squad was a penchant for indulging in morale-boosting practical jokes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a077f43f8dc19702fb3e87c41b4c6a887f0bea19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a077f43f8dc19702fb3e87c41b4c6a887f0bea19/16_202_2724_1635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Earps has kept four clean sheets in her five games at Euro 2022, thanks to saves including an acrobatic tip-over against Sweden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Earps has kept four clean sheets in her five games at Euro 2022, thanks to saves including an acrobatic tip-over against Sweden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time she didn’t feel “entitled to anything” and, when Neville subsequently dropped her entirely, had no public complaints. “I was very much of the thinking that: ‘Yeah, this is probably the end of the international road for me’,” Earps said. “I never expected anything more.”</p> <p>Wiegman, however, recognised the quality and steady improvement of a goalkeeper who, despite spending that season at Wolfsburg largely on the bench, learned a lot from playing against strikers of the calibre of the Denmark forward Pernille Harder in training.</p> <p>It has also helped that after years of frequent transfers – with spells at Birmingham, Bristol City and Reading following her time at Doncaster – United offered her the stability of a longer-term contract.</p> <p>Even so, on Tuesday it was as if a player, who takes her job so seriously she has a special monitor to gauge her sleep quality, could not quite believe the scale of her recent metamorphosis. “I’m absolutely loving playing at this level,” she said. </p> <p>“It’s such a fantastic feeling.

He also mentioned, with pride, about how he had been responsible for adding a single word to the script, which appears in the last line, spoken with such valedictory elegance by Gielgud: “I think I have time for just<em> </em>one more.” David had suggested the “just”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82f416e82d736a5095e4ef0a0fec3b7a3baa7c45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82f416e82d736a5095e4ef0a0fec3b7a3baa7c45/0_0_5314_3976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Awe-inspiring: Ellen Burnstyn and Warner in Providence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Awe-inspiring … Ellen Burnstyn and Warner in Providence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David finally agreed to sit for me after I had described to him at length what my system of masking in the aperture gate of a 35mm camera allowed me to do. The masking, which is uniquely particular to photochemical film, allows me to film part of the picture, like a form of stencilling, before rewinding the roll and filming another part. I only see what I have filmed when I finally process the negative, often months later. I told David that I would be able to film anyone or anything alongside him in the film frame and the example I gave was of a hummingbird. Unknowingly, I had stumbled upon the key; David loved hummingbirds. He told me they had played a large part in his emotional life over the last 20 years since living in Los Angeles. For the non-religious, he wrote, hummingbirds were the equivalent of angels and when I later visited him, I saw he had made an altar to them in his flat.</p> <p>The stage was set. I filmed David in a house in Hackney. First, for <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/display/2018/his-picture-in-little-shakespeare-hamlet-and-tacita-dean\">His Picture in Little </a>(2017) for the Miniatures Gallery in the National Portrait Gallery, I chose to film three actors from three generations who had all played Hamlet to great acclaim on the British stage: David, Stephen Dillane and Ben Whishaw. They would appear together photochemically “in the frame” but were all filmed using my masking technique at different times and in different places. I realised it was not easy to ask an actor, who is used to direction, merely to sit and do nothing, so to make the relationship between artist and subject more comprehensible, I drew small pencil portraits of David while the camera turned.</p> <p>I filmed him on the left of the frame, the right and even in the middle, notionally next to Ben Whishaw, whom I’d already filmed, and in anticipation of Stephen Dillane, whom I’d film later. I did not direct him but merely depicted him. David’s presence was so entrancing that he carried every frame beautifully and something curious happened: unstageable moments of synchronous reaction between the actors – movements, gestures, looks. The only direction had been chance itself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7280a0bda7cf69f0e8f64c7b2bca8532eb31a80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7280a0bda7cf69f0e8f64c7b2bca8532eb31a80/0_0_5581_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tacita Dean Providence, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"426\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tacita Dean Providence, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Tacita Dean; Frith Street Gallery, London and Marian Goodman Gallery, New York/Paris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally came roll 50: the roll that I had earmarked to take back to California to fill with hummingbirds. David understood the gravity of the roll and his role in it; he knew he would be in a future duet with hummingbirds, and he performed it so, summoning his angels in absentia, as emotional memory and in blissful reverie. His performance was perfect. I understood the gravity of the roll, too, terrified that I would fail to capture the elusive birds that dart and vanish and never stay still. There would be no possibility of a second take, no chance of <em>just</em> one more.</p> <p>I researched hummingbird habits intensively, spoke with experts and investigated reliable places where the birds tended to gather and at what time of day. Eventually I narrowed the location down to one flowerbed at dusk in Huntington Botanical Gardens in Pasadena. The birds answered the call and performed.</p> <p>I called the film Providence (2017) in honour of Resnais’s film and David’s part in it but mostly in acknowledgment of the providential moment that led me to make the film in the first place and then to achieving it. The last time I saw David was him watching the film in the National Portrait Gallery with his son Luke. The elegiac beauty of his father’s performance, not to mention the valedictory nature of it, overcame Luke and I left them together silhouetted in front of the hummingbirds, father moved by his son and son moved by his father.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/28/england-germany-euro-2022-final-wembley-fiver","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T15:58:10Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | England v Germany and Weird Uncle Fiver’s big Wembley day out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/england-germany-euro-2022-final-wembley-fiver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/28/england-germany-euro-2022-final-wembley-fiver","fields":{"headline":"England v Germany and Weird Uncle Fiver’s big Wembley day out","trailText":"<strong>In today’s Fiver: </strong>England and Germany set up a <em>Klassiker</em> of a Euro 2022 final, and tempers flare at Torino","byline":"Will Unwin","body":"<h2><strong>QUE SERA, SERA …</strong></h2> <p>England’s Euro 2022 campaign has been a tough time for the Who Cares Brigade. Winning in front of 68,781 at Old Trafford. Who cares? Beating Norway 8-0. Who cares? Completing the group unbeaten with a 4-0 victory over Northern Ireland. Who cares? Battling past the tiki-taka of the Spanish and then thrashing Sweden, the second-best team in the entire world. Who cares? To the WCB, the whole thing is simply not worth watching, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/27/englands-euro-2022-win-over-sweden-drew-peak-tv-audience-of-93-million\">9.3 million people apparently disagree</a>.</p> <p>Now, time for a final against Germany at a packed Wembley and mixed emotions for Weird Uncle Fiver, a hardcore WCB ultra. He has repeatedly barged into the Fiver family WhatsApp to show his disdain that they have moved EastEnders and the One Show for the sake of women kicking a ball. Now, though, Weird Uncle Fiver has changed his tune because there is a little bit of history between the two nations and, frankly, he has jumped on every bandwagon since the wheel was invented.</p> <p>Uncle Fiver has bad memories of facing the Germans. He once went to test-drive a BMW but left upset after finding out he had to bring it back. From that day on he vowed to only ever buy British, so is currently driving an Austin Metro and gets by without lightbulbs in his house. Now he has new enemies to focus on: Alexandra Popp, Sophie Kleinherne, Merle Frohms and Lina Magull are in his sights, as is a trip to the tattoo parlour to get portraits of Lucy Bronze and Beth Mead inked on to his back.</p> <p>Last year’s Euros final was perhaps the best day of Weird Uncle Fiver’s life, apart from the loss on penalties and his subsequently arrest. He will return to Lah’n this weekend, head to toe in red and white paint, joining the masses to cheer on the Lionesses from Leicester Square. After all, he has modernised and is as woke as any Tory minister these days. As he messaged the WhatsApp group this morning: “If you don’t put a flare up your [snip! – Fiver Ed] on Sunday, you’re a s£xist.”</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“It will be a great football feast.

It is known that as a result of three rocket strikes, the building of the secondary school in Korabelny district was almost completely destroyed. One person was injured.”</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>The strikes came as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> celebrated Statehood Day for the first time.</strong> In a national message, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “Restless morning. Again – missile terror. We will not give up. We will not give up. Do not intimidate us. Ukraine is an independent, free, indivisible state. And it will always be like that.”</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s counter-offensive in Kherson is gathering momentum, according to the UK Ministry of Defence.</strong> In an intelligence report issued this morning, the ministry said: “Their forces have highly likely established a bridgehead south of the Ingulets River, which forms the northern boundary of Russian-occupied Kherson.

According to his biographers, he was born in 1967 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the son of a bookkeeper and a car mechanic.</p> <p>Trained as an interpreter at the Soviet Military Institute of Foreign Languages in Moscow, Bout spent some time with the Soviet army working as translator in Angola in the late 1980s, rising to the rank of <a href=\"http://www.victorbout.com/FAQ.htm\">lieutenant</a>, according to his website.</p> <p>He first came to prominence in the tumultuous early days after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. There, he enjoyed two big advantages that catapulted his career as an arms dealer: access to a large fleet of Soviet-era aircraft and a huge stockpile of surplus weaponry.</p> <p>During his decades-long career, Bout is believed to have armed the Taliban and the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone, Charles Taylor’s regime in Liberia, Unita in Angola, various Congolese factions and Abu Sayyaf, a militant Islamic group in the Philippines.</p> <p>In the process, Bout, who is rumoured to speak six languages, became known as one of the world’s most wanted men, with numerous international arrest warrants issued against him.</p> <p>In 2002, the Los Angeles Times <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-may-19-ad-bout-story.html\">profiled</a> Bout, quoting a former US government official who described him as the “Donald Trump or Bill Gates” of arms trafficking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9b7da38e93e54ba97e257f01216b6dd5ec68c1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9b7da38e93e54ba97e257f01216b6dd5ec68c1f/0_133_3003_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Bout held by Thai police\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Bout held by Thai police after his arrest in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apichart Weerawong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His larger-than-life persona was further boosted by the release of the 2005 crime drama Lord of War, featuring the Hollywood star Nicolas Cage, which was believed to have been loosely based on Bout’s life.</p> <p>Bout was finally arrested at a luxury hotel in Bangkok in 2008, in a spectacular US sting operation in which undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agents posed as rebels from the Colombian group Farc, catching him on camera trying to sell weapons for use against Americans.</p> <p>Four years later, he was sentenced in a court in New York to 25 years in prison. When the prosecutor said he had agreed to sell weapons to kill Americans, Bout shouted: “It’s a lie! God knows this truth.”</p> <p>His defence attorney, Albert Dayan, said US officials were targeting his client because they were embarrassed that Bout’s companies had helped deliver goods to American military contractors involved in the Iraq war. Others have also questioned the severity of his sentence.</p> <p>The judge, Shira Scheindlin, who presided over his case, later said that Bout “got a hard deal”.</p> <p>“If you asked me today: ‘Do you think 10 years would be a fair sentence?’ I would say yes,” Scheindlin said.</p> <p>At the time, Russian officials, who unsuccessfully tried to prevent his extradition to the US, criticised the sentencing as “baseless and biased”, adding that Moscow would “take whatever action necessary to repatriate Viktor Bout back to his motherland by any means within international law”.</p> <p>Bout’s relationship with Russia’s political elites, experts say, is as murky as his arms-dealing career.</p> <p>“He seems to be well regarded and well respected in the military intelligence,” said Andrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist and security services expert. But, Soldatov added, Bout’s exact ties with Russia’s security services remained a mystery.</p> <p>Soldatov said it was highly likely that Bout had worked for the Russian intelligence service GRU during his time in Angola. “The very fact that he could be involved in the swap shows his value to the security services,” Soldatov said.</p> <p>Bout has now spent 12 years behind US bars and is said to be serving his sentence alongside a number of prominent American neo-Nazis and white supremacist extremists, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/24/white-nationalist-christopher-cantwell-turns-himself-in-to-virginia-police\">Christopher Cantwell.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the Politico reporter Chris Miller, who has been exchanging letters with Cantwell, Bout recently stated that Ukraine should not exist as a country and kept a photo of Vladimir Putin in his prison cell.</p> <p>In Moscow he was never forgotten.

Last year, the Moscow’s civic chamber exhibited 24 of his prison-made artworks, including a number of self-portraits behind bars featuring his signature moustache.</p> <p>Vladimir Zherebenkov, Whelan’s lawyer, said on Thursday that Russia had proposed in 2020 to exchange his client for Bout, an offer he said the US rejected.</p> <p>If returned to Moscow, Bout is likely to receive a hero’s welcome, similar to that enjoyed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/27/anna-chapman-agent-provocateur\">Anna Chapman</a>, the Russian spy who was part of a prisoner exchange in 2010.</p> <p>And while much of his life will remain shrouded in secrecy, his career as an arms dealer is perhaps best portrayed in the 2014 documentary film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/14/the-notorious-mr-bout-review\">The Notorious Mr Bout</a>.

Samira remains in a critical condition in the intensive care unit while Husnara and Sadiqul are said to be recovering well. Police are keen to speak to them as soon as they can to try to establish what happened.</p> <p>The family, from the Riverside area of Cardiff, were on a two-month holiday visiting relatives in the country and renting a flat in the eastern city of Sylhet.</p> <p>Supt Farid Uddin said: “Our primary suspicion is they were poisoned. When we reviewed the incident – all the members of the family had slept in the same room, the doors were locked and there was no sign of forced entry or trauma – with our prior experience, the case of poisoning made sense.”</p> <p>“We are doing everything necessary to determine the cause of their death. Doctors are yet to send the postmortem report. Our team has already preserved samples from the deceased persons, and we have also collected samples. They’ll be further examined in our laboratory and we’ll have a better understanding of the cause of their death.</p> <p>“Our investigators are speaking with the relatives of the victims. So far we don’t think they have any enmity with anyone. We are waiting for the remaining family members to get better so we can talk to them as well.”</p> <p>Uddin said the family had slept in the same room after eating dinner on Monday night. The following day, other relatives raised the alarm after they could hear no sound coming from the flat and tried unsuccessfully to open the door.</p> <p>Masudul Amin, the investigating officer, said: “We are also speaking with the relatives who were in the apartment and other residents of the building. No one has been detained or arrested in this murder.”</p> <p>Dr Moiul Islam Dalim, who is in charge of the intensive care unit at the Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College, said: “We are treating three patients of the family for ‘unknown poisoning’. The mother and the son are doing well now but the daughter, Samira, is critical. She’s on life support. The type of poisoning can only be determined after laboratory examinations of the samples we collected from the patient’s body.”</p> <p>There was shock and disbelief in the Riverside area of Cardiff. Muhibur Islam, an official at the Jalalia Mosque &amp; Islamic Education Centre, said: “It’s very terrible. I’ve known the family for many years. Riverside is the hub of the Bangladeshi community in Cardiff and they were very well liked there. It’s very tragic, hard to take in.”</p> <p>Islam said the family had been on holiday in Bangladesh. “They were poisoned. The circumstances are not clear. We’re praying that those who have survived will pull through.” He said Rafiqul Islam’s mother and two siblings had flown to Bangladesh. “We’re praying fo them all.”</p> <p>One of their neighbours, who asked not to be named, said: “It is so shocking. We’ve been living near them for more than 25 years. They are a quiet family who do their own thing. They were just a nice, neat family.”</p> <p>A Labour councillor for Riverside, Kanaya Singh, said: “Clearly this is a worrying and tragic event. Everyone I have spoken to in the community speaks very highly of the family and our thoughts are with them.</p> <p>“There is also a great deal of concern because many people from Riverside go to Bangladesh on a regular basis. I hope that the authorities are able to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible.”</p> <p>Rafiqul Islam’s brother-in-law, Abdul Mumin Khan, described him as a “very nice guy” and his son as “very sweet and friendly”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mohammed Haroon, general secretary of the Bangladesh Association Cardiff, who used to work with Rafiqul Islam, said: “He was a very nice person, very helpful person who was at the mosque all the time and constantly working with the community.” Haroon said Rafiqul Islam was a member of their local badminton and football teams.</p> <p>A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are providing consular assistance to a British family following an incident in Bangladesh and are in contact with the local authorities.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/28/abortion-clincs-closing-states-roe-v-wade-guttmacher-study","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T15:44:47Z","webTitle":"Sharp rise in US abortion clinic closures after Roe v Wade overturned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/abortion-clincs-closing-states-roe-v-wade-guttmacher-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/abortion-clincs-closing-states-roe-v-wade-guttmacher-study","fields":{"headline":"Sharp rise in US abortion clinic closures after Roe v Wade overturned","trailText":"Guttmacher study shows reduction in clinics offering care in 11 states that have implemented bans since supreme court ruling","byline":"Maya Yang in New York","body":"<p>The number of clinics offering abortion care in 11 US states that have implemented total or six-week bans in the month since the supreme court overturned abortion rights has dropped from 71 to 43, a new <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/07/one-month-post-roe-least-43-abortion-clinics-across-11-states-have-stopped-offering\">study</a> shows.</p> <p>In the study released on Thursday, the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that studies sexual and reproductive health, said that among the the 11 states, as of 24 July seven no longer had a single clinic providing abortion care.</p> <p>Those states were Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/vasectomy-roe-v-wade-abortion-supreme-court\">Snipped in solidarity: the American men getting vasectomies after Roe – while they can</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The majority of those states had between one and five abortion clinics before the conservative-dominated court overturned Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that affirmed the constitutional right to abortion.</p> <p>The seven states accounted for 80,500 abortions in 2020, an average of 6,700 a month.</p> <p>As of 24 July, the Guttmacher report said, four states – Georgia, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee – had implemented an abortion ban starting at six weeks of pregnancy.</p> <p>According to the study, Georgia and Tennessee now have fewer clinics providing abortion services than before the supreme court decision. Georgia, which previously had 14 clinics, now has 13. In Tennessee, the number of clinics dropped from seven to three.</p> <p>One reason the institute cited as a probable cause for falling numbers of abortion clinics in such states is that many people are not able to get an abortion due to the drastically shortened access window.</p> <p>Before six weeks of pregnancy, many are unaware they are pregnant. Those who are aware are left with two weeks at most to decide whether to undergo an abortion, then schedule and obtain one, which usually includes logistical obstacles such as long and sometimes forced waiting periods.</p> <p>Such restrictions can push people beyond the six-week limit, thus making an in-state abortion very difficult to obtain.</p> <p>In a statement, Rachel Jones, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, said: “While 11 states already had complete or six-week bans one month after the decision, even more will implement abortion bans in the coming days, weeks and months.</p> <p>“Kentucky and Florida have begun rolling back access to abortion by implementing 15-week abortion bans. Meanwhile, in Wisconsin, legal uncertainty over the status of the state’s pre-Roe abortion ban has caused providers to stop offering abortion care.</p> <p>“In total, as many as 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion now that Roe is no longer in place.”</p> <p>“These clinic closures resulting from state-level bans will further deepen inequities in access to care based on race, gender, income, age or immigration status since long travel distances to reach a clinic in another state will be a barrier for many people.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/jul/28/nhs-closing-down-london-gender-identity-clinic-for-children","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T15:32:50Z","webTitle":"NHS to close Tavistock gender identity clinic for children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/28/nhs-closing-down-london-gender-identity-clinic-for-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jul/28/nhs-closing-down-london-gender-identity-clinic-for-children","fields":{"headline":"NHS to close Tavistock gender identity clinic for children","trailText":"Tavistock and Portman trust’s clinic will shut and two services will be set up in hospitals in London and north-west England","byline":"Andrew Gregory Health editor","body":"<p>The NHS is shutting down its gender identity clinic for children at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust after it was criticised in an independent review.</p> <p>Regional centres would be set up to replace the service and “ensure the holistic needs” of patients are fully met, NHS England said, after being warned that only having one provider was “not a safe or viable long-term option”.</p> <p>The Tavistock clinic, named the Gender and Identity Development Service (Gids), was launched more than three decades ago to help children and other young people struggling with their gender identity.</p> <p>But in recent years, concerns have repeatedly been raised about the service. Inspectors rated it “inadequate” after complaints raised by whistleblowers, patients and families.</p> <p>The service was criticised for its care of patients both inside and outside the clinic, and it also had record waiting lists. Doctors reported concerns that some patients were referred on to a gender transitioning pathway too quickly.</p> <p>“The aim is to close the Tavistock clinic [the Gender and Identity Development Service (Gids)] by spring 2023, moving to the new provider model through specialist children hospitals,” a senior NHS source told the Guardian. There will be no immediate changes for patients already under the Tavistock’s care, according to the source. “The children being seen by the Tavistock (and those on waiting lists) will be transferred to a new provider over the course of that time.”</p> <p>In a statement, NHS England said it intended to build a “more resilient service” by expanding provision, and would establish two services led by specialist children’s hospitals in London and north-west England.</p> <p>It followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/nhs-gender-identity-service-for-children-cant-cope-with-demand-review-finds\">recommendations</a> from Dr Hilary Cass, who is leading an independent review of gender identity services for children and young people.</p> <p>She said there was a need to move away from a model of a sole provider, and instead establish regional services to better meet patients’ needs.</p> <p>In her interim report, released in March, she wrote: “It has become increasingly clear that a single specialist provider model is not a safe or viable long-term option in view of concerns about lack of peer review and the ability to respond to the increasing demand.”</p> <p>Cass said there was “insufficient evidence” for her to make any firm recommendations around the routine use of puberty blockers. She told the NHS to “enrol young people being considered for hormone treatment into a formal research protocol with adequate follow-up into adulthood, with a more immediate focus on the questions regarding puberty blockers”.</p> <p>Her interim report found the rise in referrals to the Gids at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust in London had resulted in overwhelmed staff and waiting lists of up to two years.</p> <p>Cass said this was leaving young people “at considerable risk” of distress and deteriorating mental health. The number of referrals to the service went from 138 in 2010-11 to 2,383 in 2020-21.</p> <p>Last spring, in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/20/gender-identity-development-service-for-children-rated-inadequate\">highly critical report</a> on the Gids, the Care Quality Commission demanded monthly updates on waiting list numbers and actions to reduce them.</p> <p>NHS England said the two new services in London and north-west England would be the “first step” in a national regional network “given the urgent requirement to stabilise current service provision for patients”.</p> <p>The final number is yet to be confirmed but it is understood seven or eight services could eventually be put in place.</p> <p>The London-based service will be led by Great Ormond Street hospital and Evelina London children’s hospital, with South London and Maudsley NHS foundation trust providing specialist mental health support.</p> <p>A second service in the north-west will be led by Alder Hey children’s NHS foundation trust and the Royal Manchester children’s hospital, with both trusts providing specialist mental health services.</p> <p>These will take over clinical responsibility for and management of all Gids patients – including those on the waiting list, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>A Gids spokesperson said the service supported plans for a new model due to a rise in referrals.

Rooney had alleged that stories from her private Instagram account were being leaked by Vardy to journalists at the Sun. Vardy said this was false and sued Rooney in an attempt to clear her name, which put the pressure on Rooney to substantiate her claim.</p> <p>Potential outcomes include complete victory for Vardy and the award of substantial damages on the basis that Rooney’s circumstantial evidence was not enough to justify her defamatory allegation; vindication for Rooney on the basis that she had good reason to make the accusation against Vardy and it was in the public interest; or an uncomfortable halfway verdict where Vardy wins on a technicality but is awarded only a token sum in damages.</p> <p>A media circus grew up around the trial, with headlines around the world covering details of everything from Peter Andre’s personal anatomy to Vardy’s requests to get paid for selling stories to the Sun, and claims that a mobile phone containing potentially crucial WhatsApp messages was purposefully dropped into the North Sea after a request was made to search it.</p> <p>But because the use of juries has in effect been abolished for libel trials in England and Wales, there was no instant verdict as to who had won the case. When the court proceedings wrapped up, everyone moved on. The footballers’ wives and their families went on holiday, the lawyers dealt with other trials, and as far as the public were concerned it went quiet.</p> <p>What has really been happening is that the high court judge Mrs Justice Steyn has spent the last two months considering the evidence and relevant aspects of law. The judge, who, as Vardy and Rooney were often reminded, was the only person who really mattered in the courtroom, has now written up her ruling. Rather than hand it down at court and get the old media circus back together, it will simply be published online at midday for the relevant parties to digest and potentially appeal against.</p> <p>The case was a rare libel trial in an era when the English and Welsh legal system heavily incentivises cases being settled before they get to court. Since neither side was willing to back down, the result was a full court battle. Both parties were rich women with high media profiles who will be able to afford the legal fees regardless of the verdict – making the case as much about both sides’ reputations in the public eye as the actual legal outcome.</p> <p>At the heart of the case was the question of whether Rooney – the wife of the former England footballer Wayne Rooney – could substantiate her original claim that Vardy – the wife of Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy – was the person who made the leak.</p> <p>Rooney’s original accusation, after an extensive sting operation, stated that she believed “It Was………… Rebekah Vardy’s account” that was leaking stories to the Sun. Rooney always maintained that she intended her post to mean that someone with access to Rebekah Vardy’s Instagram account was doing the leaking, rather than necessarily Vardy herself.</p> <p>But at a pre-trial hearing a judge ruled that Rooney was making a direct personal accusation against Vardy. This allowed Vardy to argue in court that her former agent Caroline Watt may have been the real leaker, acting without her knowledge.</p> <p>Ironically, hope for Rooney could come from unlikely source – the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr’s recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/13/arron-banks-loses-libel-action-against-reporter-carole-cadwalladr-guardian-defamation-brexit-russia\">success in a libel case</a> brought by the Brexit campaign funder Arron Banks.</p> <p>That case was overseen by the same judge, who accepted Cadwalladr’s public interest defence on the basis that the journalist had “reasonable grounds to believe that her intended meaning was true” when it was made.</p> <p>Rooney will be hoping that a similar interpretation of the law will be made in her favour – and will mean she was legally justified to make the claim against Vardy.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/28/ex-carillion-executives-face-1m-in-fines-over-market-abuse-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T15:25:54Z","webTitle":"Ex-Carillion executives face £1m in fines over ‘market abuse’ claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/ex-carillion-executives-face-1m-in-fines-over-market-abuse-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/28/ex-carillion-executives-face-1m-in-fines-over-market-abuse-claims","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Carillion executives face £1m in fines over ‘market abuse’ claims","trailText":"Richard Howson, Richard Adam and Zafar Khan appeal against watchdog findings that they ‘acted recklessly'","byline":"Kalyeena Makortoff","body":"<p>Three former Carillion executives have been accused of “market abuse” by the City regulator and could face combined fines worth nearly £1m for issuing misleading statements regarding the disgraced outsourcer’s financial health before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/carillion-fallout-deepens-as-workers-face-pay-being-stopped-in-48-hours\">it collapsed in 2018</a>.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that it found the executives had “acted recklessly” and had been aware the company was publishing “misleadingly positive” statements about its finances in 2016 and 2017, particularly in relation to the UK construction arm.</p> <p>The watchdog said the former chief executive Richard Howson, and former finance directors Richard Adam and Zafar Khan “were each aware of the deteriorating expected financial performance within Carillion’s UK construction business and the increasing financial risks associated with it”.</p> <p>“Despite their awareness of these deteriorations and increasing risks, they also failed to make the board and the audit committee aware of them, resulting in a lack of proper oversight.”</p> <p>The FCA said it intended to issue fines against all three executives: £397,800 against Howson, £318,000 against Adam, and £154,000 against Khan as a result of the findings. However, the findings and fines are currently provisional, as all three are appealing against the decision at the regulator’s upper tribunal.</p> <p>The FCA’s executive director of enforcement and market oversight, Mark Steward, said: “Carillion failed to take reasonable steps to establish and maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to enable it to comply with its obligations under the listing rules.</p> <p>“As a result its true financial position remained hidden over many months and the effects of its collapse were aggravated, causing substantial harm to shareholders and creditors. This is market abuse, and as damaging to market integrity as insider dealing and manipulation, though not often described in this way. It should be.”</p> <p>The demise of Carillion was the UK’s biggest corporate failure in decades. The outsourcer collapsed with £7bn of debts in January 2018, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/carillion-collapse-two-years-on-government-has-learned-nothing\">3,000 job losses and causing chaos</a> across hundreds of its projects and public sector works, including schools, roads, prisons and even Liverpool FC’s stadium, Anfield.</p> <p>It also delayed the construction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/17/two-hospitals-held-up-by-carillion-collapse\">two new hospitals</a> including the 646-bed Royal Liverpool and 669-bed Midland Metropolitan in Sandwell, West Midlands, which were due to open in 2017 and 2018, respectively, resulting in the projects running hundreds of millions of pounds over budget.</p> <p>The FCA said it was issuing Carillion with a pubic censure rather than a financial penalty, given the firm had collapsed and was already going through the process of being liquidated. The FCA said Carillion would have otherwise faced a fine worth nearly £38m.</p> <p>• The subheading and text of this article were amended on 28 July 2022 to give the correct first name for Richard Howson.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/28/joe-manchin-climate-bill-fossil-fuels-reaction","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T15:24:49Z","webTitle":"Activists surprised and relieved at Manchin’s decision to back climate bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/28/joe-manchin-climate-bill-fossil-fuels-reaction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/28/joe-manchin-climate-bill-fossil-fuels-reaction","fields":{"headline":"Activists surprised and relieved at Manchin’s decision to back climate bill","trailText":"But the senator’s insistence on more fossil fuel drilling was called a ‘climate suicide pact’ by one expert","byline":"Oliver Milman in New York","body":"<p>Climate advocates reacted with surprise and delight to Joe Manchin’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/manchin-deal-democrats-schumer-reconciliation-bill-climate-health\">decision</a> to back a sweeping bill to combat the climate crisis, with analysts predicting the legislation will bring the US close to its target of slashing planet-heating emissions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/jul/28/joe-manchin-biden-democrats-climate-spending-bill-latest\">Joe Manchin makes U-turn on tax and climate bill as US edges closer to recession – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The West Virginia senator, who has made millions from his ownership of a coal-trading company, had seemingly thwarted Joe Biden’s hopes of passing meaningful climate legislation – only to reveal on Wednesday his support for a $369bn package to support renewable energy and electric vehicle rollout.</p> <p>The move by the centrist Democrat shocked many of Manchin’s colleagues, who despaired after more than 18 months of seemingly fruitless negotiations with the lawmaker, a crucial vote in an evenly divided Senate.</p> <p>“Holy shit,” tweeted Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota. “Stunned, but in a good way.”</p> <p>Should the bill pass both chambers of Congress and be signed by Biden, it will be the biggest and arguably first piece of climate legislation ever enacted by the US. The world’s largest historical carbon polluter has repeatedly failed to act on the climate crisis due to missed opportunities, staunch Republican opposition and the machinations of the fossil fuel lobby.</p> <p>The climate spending, part of a broader bill called the Inflation Reduction Act, “has the potential to be a historic turning point” said Al Gore, the former vice-president.</p> <p>“It represents the single largest investment in climate solutions and environmental justice in US history. Decades of tireless work by climate advocates across the country led to this moment.”</p> <p>The bulk of the bill includes hefty tax credits to unleash clean energy projects such as wind and solar as well as a rebate of up to $7,500 for Americans who want to buy new electric vehicles. There is $9bn to retrofit houses to make them more energy efficient, tax credits for heat pumps and rooftop solar and a $27bn “clean energy technology accelerator” to help deploy new renewable technology.</p> <p>A further $60bn would go towards environmental justice projects and there is a new program to reduce leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas drilling.</p> <p>“This will be, by far, the biggest climate action in human history,” said Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii. “The planet is on fire. Emissions reductions are the main thing. This is enormous progress. Let’s get it done.”</p> <p>The authors of the bill predict it will cut US emissions by 40% by 2030, based on 2005 levels, a claim guardedly backed by independent experts. Scientists have said global emissions must be halved this decade then zeroed out by 2050 if the world is to avoid catastrophic heatwaves, droughts, floods and other climate impacts. Biden has set US emissions targets along these lines.</p> <p>The bill would “bring clean energy jobs to America and lower energy bills for American families”, tweeted Leah Stokes, a climate policy expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p> <p>“It would get us 80% of the way to President Biden’s climate goal. This is a gamechanger.”</p> <p>However, Manchin has said the legislation “does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels” and has extracted guarantees of new offshore and onshore drilling, including a stipulation that millions more acres of public lands be opened for fossil fuel companies before new solar or wind energy projects can do the same.</p> <p>The West Virginia senator is a keen backer of a large proposed gas pipeline in his home state and has called for greater domestic oil production, citing fears over inflation.</p> <p>The requirement for more drilling leases amounts to a “climate suicide pact”, according to Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity.</p> <p>“The new leasing required in this bill will fan the flames of the climate disasters torching our country,” Hartl said, lamenting “a slap in the face to the communities fighting to protect themselves from filthy fossil fuels”.</p> <p>Should the bill pass, it will almost certainly do so without a single Republican vote, with the party still almost uniformly opposed to any significant action to address the climate crisis or impinge on the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, said he could not believe that Manchin “is agreeing to a massive tax increase in the name of climate change when our economy is in a recession. I hope that common sense will eventually win the day.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/28/care-autistic-children-job-work-benefits","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T15:23:50Z","webTitle":"I’ve cared for my autistic children all my life.

I have the opportunity of doing some part-time work but if I make any changes to my circumstances it could have an effect on the benefits I get. I wouldn’t get as much help with housing benefit – I live in a privately rented, two-bedroom house – so I’d have to make up the rent shortfall. On top of that, if I continued to live where I do now I would need to pay the under-occupancy charge, otherwise known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/31/bedroom-tax-victims-forgotten-welfare-reform\">bedroom tax</a>.</p> <p>This is upsetting as my child comes home from university every other weekend, and during holidays, but when I called an advice line for people who are struggling financially and asked where they could sleep, the man on the phone suggested “the sofa?” When I looked online, it seemed that families with children at university would not be penalised. So I’m trying to get help and advice, but it’s hard when you’re given false information.</p> <p>A bit of part-time work might not be a huge amount of money, but it will mean a little bit of self-worth, a bit of dignity and my own cash. I’m also trying to find out how my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/13/universal-credit-jump-through-hoops-give-up\">universal credit</a> will be affected if I were to work part-time, but I can’t get a straight answer. I’m concerned about making changes and being worse off. </p> <p>So, for now, both me and Boris Johnson are out of a job. I can’t imagine the next prime minister will be any more interested in people who are on benefits than he is. I remember canvassers knocking on the door before the last general election, trying to get me to see all the good things that the Tories had done. I just thought, you have stripped away benefits, and now with the cost of living rising, it doesn’t feel as if we have been given any thought.</p> <p>The image some people have of benefits recipients is that we’re having an easy life. While I’m grateful that being on benefits has allowed me to raise two autistic children as a single parent, there has been a detrimental impact on me. I think it has chipped away at my confidence. There is no validation that comes with being on benefits in the way you get with a job.</p> <p>Four days a week, I volunteer at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/22/liverpool-food-banks-confront-rising-hunger\">food bank</a>, and I really do get a sense of having done something good, but I wonder if I use it as an excuse to not try harder to look for full-time work. I love what I do and wonder if I could still volunteer a little if I were to get part-time work, but would it be enough to cover my outgoings? It’s been so long since I’ve had paid work, I don’t know what to do, and that’s a real problem<em>.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/20/hours-on-phone-dwp-my-dad-carer\"> I’ve spent too many hours on the phone to the DWP – I’ve reached my limit in being nice  | Siobhan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At school I wanted to be a long-distance truck driver, but the careers counsellor dismissed it and said I should do something else. I never ended up learning to drive. I left school at 16 and went into what was called a youth training scheme. I became pregnant and left before I finished it. Because I’ve not had a job before, it’s not like I have something to go back to. Now I’m in my 40s, I’m just trying to find something that fits, and I’m scared. What if I can’t do it? What if I give someone the wrong impression that I can do a job I’m not really capable of? It’s difficult to believe you can do it. And I feel old.</p> <p>I started an application for a job at my local supermarket, but I didn’t get very far before I felt out of my depth. The questions about using my initiative made me feel as if I was almost being tricked: I didn’t know the answers. I just thought I’m never going to get anywhere, and just closed the page. I can’t even imagine what a job interview would be like.</p> <p>Over the last few years, I’ve taken a few free online courses just to put something on my CV, because when people ask what I do, I say: “I’m just a mum.” But I’m aware being “just” a mum has given me a transferable skillset, from organisation to timekeeping. Being the sole parent of two autistic children means my negotiating skills are fantastic, and I’m good at thinking on my feet. I just don’t know how to put myself forward, or get someone to see this in me. The confidence has been knocked out of me and I feel like I’m fighting against a lot of younger people.</p> <p>It’s partly a lack of self-worth but it’s also practical. Because if it goes wrong, what do I do then? If I came off benefits but my job didn’t work out as I’d hoped, I would have to start a new claim. It isn’t just me I have to think about – my child is at university but I’m still responsible for them, even though my universal credit no longer covers them.

The Unite strike is timed to coincide with an increase in traffic: the number of containers begins to rise from August, as retailers bring over more goods, particularly from the far east, to start filling their warehouses before Christmas.</p> <p>The dispute is with the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company, which is owned by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, owner of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/3-mobile-network\">Three</a> mobile phone network and healthcare retailer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/18/peter-macnab-superdrug-boss-leading-the-high-street-fightback\">Superdrug</a>. </p> <p>The Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company made a pre-tax profit of almost £61m in 2020, according to its most recent accounts.</p> <p>“The bottom line is this is an extremely wealthy company that can fully afford to give its workers a pay rise,” said Graham. “Instead it chose to give bonanza payouts to shareholders touching £100m.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the port company said: “The company made what we believe to be a very fair offer and we are disappointed with the result of the ballot. The union has agreed to our request to meet with Acas next week and we hope that any industrial action can be avoided.”</p> <p>The vote for action came as a senior union official predicted rolling strikes across the economy for the rest of the year beginning with a “summer of solidarity”, as workers become emboldened to protest in the face of rising living costs.</p> <p>Simon Weller, the assistant general secretary of the train drivers union Aslef and a national council member of the Trades Union Congress, said strike ballots planned by <a href=\"https://www.pcs.org.uk/news-events/news/pcs-agrees-launch-industrial-action-ballot-pay-autumn\">civil servants</a> and <a href=\"https://neu.org.uk/press-releases/teacher-pay-0\">teachers </a>alongside more strikes already planned by <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/12419/College-staff-in-England-to-join-wave-of-strike-action\">college staff</a> and across the rail network – starting with train drivers walking out at seven operators on Saturday – would increase “organic momentum”.</p> <p>At the AQA exam board, 180 staff are due to stage a 72-hour strike starting on Friday after their employer failed to reopen talks over pay, according to Unison, their union. </p> <p>After Wednesday’s rail-worker strikes crippled the network across Great Britain, train drivers will also strike at nine rail companies on 13 August, in a move dismissed by the Rail Delivery Group of train operators as “a cynical approach to talks, a total disregard for passengers and putting everyone’s summer plans at risk”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) working for Network Rail and 14 train operators are planning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/14/train-drivers-at-eight-uk-operators-to-strike-on-30-july-aslef\">strikes on 18 and 20 August</a> alongside members of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) at Avanti West Coast. The RMT has announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/26/london-underground-workers-to-stage-fresh-strikes-in-august\">a strike on London Underground</a> on 19 August.</p> <p>Weller dismissed suggestions the TUC would call a general strike, which Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT, said on Wednesday he would campaign for. But Weller said: “There is going to be a summer and autumn of industrial action in multiple sectors as workers in all of these sectors say enough is enough. It is going to gain momentum.”</p> <p>Coordinated action is also likely, with strikes by different unions in the same sector on the same day, or different sectors on sequential days, to keep the pay demands in the public eye for longer, said union sources. But mass politicised stoppages across industries are unlikely, since each strike needs to be based on a specific dispute with an employer to be legal.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/jul/28/paul-sorvino-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T15:12:26Z","webTitle":"Paul Sorvino obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/28/paul-sorvino-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jul/28/paul-sorvino-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Paul Sorvino obituary","trailText":"Character actor whose roles ranged from a mafia boss in Goodfellas to a police sergeant in Law &amp; Order","byline":"Ryan Gilbey","body":"<p>Amid the carnage of Martin Scorsese’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/19/goodfellas-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-joe-pesci-ray-liotta\" title=\"\">Goodfellas</a> (1990), the actor Paul Sorvino, who has died aged 83, was a soothing presence. A reassuring, panda-like figure with a pillowy face, Sorvino played the avuncular mob kingpin Paulie Cicero, who gives the green light to most of the blood-soaked horrors on display. Yet his placatory voice and plodding, unhurried movements seem to disavow any part in the mayhem.</p> <p>During a pampered spell in prison, Paulie wields a razor blade not to wound his foes but to cut garlic into tissue-thin slices that will liquefy in the pan when cooked with oil. Serving wine with dinner in his quarters, he pads around in dressing-gown and socks. “Paulie might have moved slow,” observes Henry Hill (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/27/ray-liotta-obituary\" title=\"\">Ray Liotta</a>) admiringly. “But it was only because Paulie didn’t have to move for anybody.”</p> <p>Sorvino’s first impressions of the picture were far from positive. “I thought it was excessively violent, boring, and I was boring in it,” he <a href=\"https://www.orlandoweekly.com/arts/paul-sorvino-slaying-the-stereotype-2283122\" title=\"\">said in 2014</a>. Eventually, he came to his senses, telling himself: “Wait a minute, I think I’ve just seen a great movie, and I think [I’m] good in it.”</p> <p>The role defined him to such an extent that he made it his goal in life “to disabuse people of the notion that I’m a slow-moving, heavy-lidded thug”. Evidence included his performances as Henry Kissinger in Oliver Stone’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/03/nixon-oliver-stone-reel-history\" title=\"\">Nixon</a> (1995) and as Juliet’s father in Baz Luhrmann’s frenzied, modern-dress Romeo + Juliet (1996).</p> <p>Though he was cherished for his role as an NYPD sergeant, Phil Cerreta, in the second and third series of Law &amp; Order (1991-92), Sorvino did not exactly cross the street to avoid playing crooks and thugs. Men with Guns (1996), Kill the Irishman (2011), in which he was the real-life mobster Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno, and Once Upon a Time in Queens (2013) represent a small sample of his portraits of the criminal life.</p> <p>Born in New York, Paul was the son of Marietta (nee Renzi), a piano teacher, and Fortunato Sorvino, a factory foreman. He was educated at Lafayette high school and took singing lessons from a young age. He performed at venues in the Catskills mountains, a popular holiday destination for New Yorkers, and at charity balls where he was billed as Val Sorvino or Paul de Vere. “The names sounded more romantic than mine,” he said.</p> <p>Once his aspirations to act became clear to him, he won a scholarship to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, where he studied under <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/04/theater/sanford-meisner-a-mentor-who-guided-actors-and-directors-toward-truth-dies-at-91.html\" title=\"\">Sanford Meisner</a>. Stage work was hard to come by, though he spent almost seven months in the chorus of the Broadway musical Bajour in 1964. He worked as a waiter, acting teacher and door-to-door dictionary salesman before writing copy at an advertising agency, where his colleagues included Barbra Streisand’s brother Sheldon.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFUCkIWYpDo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XFUCkIWYpDo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Top 10 Paul Sorvino moments in Goodfellas</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the age of 30, Sorvino quit to devote his life to acting. He quickly made an impression in a clutch of small film roles including the black comedy Where’s Poppa? (1970). He appeared with that picture’s star, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/24/george-segal-obituary\" title=\"\">George Segal</a>, in A Touch of Class (1973), which also featured an Oscar-winning Glenda Jackson, and later reteamed with both actors in another romantic comedy, Lost and Found (1979).</p> <p>Rave reviews came his way for the 1972 off-Broadway premiere of Jason Miller’s Pulitzer-winning That Championship Season, about former high school basketball team-mates who meet every year to reminisce. He maintained a connection with the play, co-starring with Robert Mitchum and Martin Sheen in the 1982 film adaptation, and alongside Gary Sinise and Vincent D’Onofrio in a 1999 TV version that Sorvino directed.</p> <p>His other films include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\" title=\"\">Mike Nichols</a>’s The Day of the Dolphin (1973) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/28/guardianobituaries.filmnews\" title=\"\">Karel Reisz</a>’s The Gambler (1974), in which he was memorable as Hips, a sympathetic mob bookie. He starred in William Friedkin’s rebarbative thriller Cruising (1980) as the police captain who sends an undercover officer (Al Pacino) into New York’s gay sado-masochistic sub-culture to catch a killer.</p> <p>In Reds (1981), Warren Beatty’s film about the journalist John Reed, Sorvino played Louis C Fraina, one of the founding members of the American Communist party. It was the first of his collaborations with that actor-writer-director, who went on to cast him in the stylish comic-book adventure Dick Tracy (1990), the political satire Bulworth (1998) and the comedy-drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/21/rules-dont-apply-review-warren-beatty-howard-hughes\" title=\"\">Rules Don’t Apply</a> (2016), featuring Beatty as Howard Hughes.</p> <p>He was in the superhero adventure The Rocketeer (1991) and the Chris Tucker/Charlie Sheen comedy Money Talks (1997), and was achingly poignant as a heroin-addicted lounge singer in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1241206,.html\" title=\"\">The Cooler</a> (2003). One of his last roles was as the crime boss Frank Costello in the television series Godfather of Harlem (2019-21).</p> <p>Acting was only part of Sorvino’s story. He was a poet, tenor and sculptor, as well as an author whose published works include How to Become a Former Asthmatic (1985), which detailed his use of breathing exercises to help manage his asthma, and the cookbook Pinot, Pasta and Parties (2017). He also sold his own range of pasta sauces.</p> <p>When his daughter Mira won an Oscar for her performance in Mighty Aphrodite (1995), she credited him with teaching her “everything I know about acting”. After she alleged in 2017 that she had been sexually harassed and then blacklisted by Harvey Weinstein, Sorvino angrily expressed the hope that the disgraced producer would be jailed, “because if not, he has to meet me”. </p> <p>Sorvino is survived by his third wife, Dee Dee Benkie, whom he married in 2014, as well as by Mira and two other children, Amanda and Michael, all from his first marriage, to Lorraine Davis, which ended in divorce in 1988. His second marriage, to Vanessa Arico, also ended in divorce, in 1996.</p> <p> • Paul Anthony Sorvino, actor, born 13 April 1939; died 25 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/28/england-to-wear-white-in-euros-final-with-germany-made-to-change-kit","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T15:05:26Z","webTitle":"England to wear white in Euros final with Germany made to change kit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/england-to-wear-white-in-euros-final-with-germany-made-to-change-kit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/28/england-to-wear-white-in-euros-final-with-germany-made-to-change-kit","fields":{"headline":"England to wear white in Euros final with Germany made to change kit","trailText":"England will be wearing all white in the Women’s European Championship final, with Germany in their second-choice green kit","byline":"Paul MacInnes","body":"<p>England will be wearing all white when the Lionesses take on Germany in the Women’s European Championship final.</p> <p>Uefa has confirmed that the hosts will be in their first-choice colours as they attempt to win their first major trophy by beating the eight-times champions at Wembley on Sunday evening.

They appreciate how much students rely on their grades and want them to succeed.</p> <p>“But workers have been left with no alternative after years of what have effectively been wage cuts.

She warned that unless there is an improved offer “further strike action in the short term is highly likely”, although staff will do “all they can to catch up” to minimise delays for students.</p> <p>Of the 163 Unison members who were balloted, 91 voted and 65 were in favour of strike action. However Devonport said that AQA had launched individual consultations during the ballot which created “uncertainty for people”. She believes the turnout “belie[s] the strength of feeling on this” as further consultation with members after the ballot closed suggested they were “angry and upset”, and membership numbers were growing.</p> <p>She called on AQA to return to discussions after many staff members said they were struggling financially, following successive below-inflation pay awards.

The union said workers have been warned they could be sacked and rehired ​on different contracts if they don’t accept the offer.</p> <p>An AQA spokesperson said: “Our priority is always to make sure students get the results they deserve on time, and we have robust plans in place to make sure strike action won’t affect that.

The alleged attackers were later arrested.</p> <p>Although a peaceful demonstration calling for justice for Soto was held in the town the next day, it was followed by a racist rampage in which some residents targeted houses belonging to Gypsies, including relatives of the alleged killers. The properties were burned, looted and damaged; cars were tipped over. Some houses were also defaced with graffiti saying “killer Gypsies” and “death to Gypsies”.</p> <p>According to Gypsy groups, 31 members of six families have fled Peal de Becerro because they are afraid of further reprisals against their community. They include ill, older and vulnerable people.</p> <p>Two of the four men arrested were subsequently released pending trial, while the other two remain in custody.</p> <p>Groups representing Spain’s Gypsy communities were quick to express their sympathies over the killing, but said nothing could justify the racist crimes that followed.</p> <p>“It’s unacceptable for a group of people to take justice in their own hands, to call for the expulsion of Gypsy families from a town, and for them to burn these families’ homes and flip over their cars,” Spain’s <a href=\"https://www.gitanos.org/\">Fundación Secretariado Gitano</a> said in a statement.</p> <p>Kamira, a federation made up of associations of Gypsy women, offered its <a href=\"https://federacionkamira.com/comunicado-de-kamira-en-relacion-a-los-hechos-acontecidos-recientemente-en-peal-de-becerro-jaen/\">“condolences, sympathies and solidarity”</a> to Soto’s family, but said his death simply could not excuse the anti-Gypsy violence.</p> <p>“This was meant to be a demonstration calling for peace, but some violent people whipped others up and it became something absolutely intolerable that’s shaken the social peace and coexistence of a town,” said Kamira’s president, Carmen Santiago Reyes.</p> <p>“It’s really important that tempers cool, that the necessary investigations identify those responsible for the damage and the threats, and that the authorities stay on top of the comments on social media, which could represent incitement to hatred.”</p> <p>Santiago Reyes said justice needed to be done and social cohesion restored as soon as possible.</p> <p>“You can’t generalise over the actions of one person and force people out of their homes just because they’re related to that person,” she added. “That can’t be justified and it doesn’t belong in a society with the rule of law.”</p> <p>Kamira was among the groups that have filed criminal complaints relating to the violence. On Wednesday, public prosecutors in Andalucía said they had begun investigating the events that followed Soto’s death.</p> <p>The Guardian tried to contact Peal de Becerro’s mayor, David Rodríguez, but his office said he was too busy to speak. In <a href=\"https://elpais.com/espana/2022-07-19/el-asesinato-del-portero-de-discoteca-alvaro-prende-la-chispa-en-peal-de-becerro.html\">comments reported by El País</a>, Rodríguez described recent events as “the blackest and saddest days” in the town’s history, adding: “We will not stop until those behind the murder pay for Álvaro’s death.”</p> <p>David Jiménez Castro, a lawyer representing those who have been forced to flee, said the damage done was economic, material and psychological. Many had to leave everything behind and were dependent on relatives.</p> <p>“It’s not just about the uncertainty of having to abandon your home, it’s also the worry that everything you’ve worked for, struggled for and built over a lifetime has been lost,” he said.</p> <p>“There was one young couple who’d just got the sofa and chairs they’d been saving up for. It was all still covered in plastic.”</p> <p>Aurora Muñoz, an anti-racism activist, said that although Soto and his family deserved justice, so too did those affected by “this pogrom which was committed against the Gypsy community”. Muñoz said that while she could understand the town’s fury being directed at his alleged killers, violence had been unleashed against “families who are totally blameless and who are just being attacked because they’re Gypsies”.</p> <p>She also said that this was not the first such violence. In July 1986, Gypsy families living in the Andalucían town of Martos – which, like Peal de Becerro, sits in Jaén province – <a href=\"https://elpais.com/diario/1986/07/14/espana/521676006_850215.html\">were forced to flee after their homes were torched</a>.</p> <p>Juan de Dios Ramírez Heredia, a lawyer and former Spanish politician who serves as president of the <a href=\"https://unionromani.org/\">Union of Romani People</a>, said the scenes witnessed in Peal de Becerro were an aberration.</p> <p>“This is absolutely not normal,” he said. “I’m Gypsy and I speak from my own personal experience. Spain is not a racist country. But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t racist individuals in Spain. These are the ones who are behind awful situations like the one we’ve seen in Peal de Becerro where, all of a sudden, a group of real racists attacked Gypsy citizens who had nothing to do with this.”</p> <p>While Spain has attempted to combat anti-Gypsy racism – congress recently approved <a href=\"https://www.europapress.es/epsocial/igualdad/noticia-congreso-da-luz-verde-ley-zerolo-tipifica-primera-vez-antigitanismo-delito-odio-20220630190737.html\">an anti-discrimination law classing </a><em><a href=\"https://www.europapress.es/epsocial/igualdad/noticia-congreso-da-luz-verde-ley-zerolo-tipifica-primera-vez-antigitanismo-delito-odio-20220630190737.html\">antigitanismo</a></em><a href=\"https://www.europapress.es/epsocial/igualdad/noticia-congreso-da-luz-verde-ley-zerolo-tipifica-primera-vez-antigitanismo-delito-odio-20220630190737.html\"> as a hate crime</a> – Gypsies continue to suffer marginalisation.</p> <p>Two years ago, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/06/former-un-expert-philip-alston-decries-spains-utterly-inadequate-social-protection-system\">former UN poverty expert Philip Alston called on the Spanish government to carry out an independent, comprehensive review</a> to ensure that Roma children were “not doomed to repeat the cycle of poverty and exclusion”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of Roma and north African people living in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/27/you-kind-of-die-life-without-power-in-the-canada-real-spain\">sprawling Cañada Real shantytown near Madrid have been without power for almost two years</a>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/28/why-has-keir-starmer-picked-battle-over-shadow-ministers-on-picket-lines","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T14:50:46Z","webTitle":"Why has Keir Starmer picked battle over shadow ministers on picket lines?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/why-has-keir-starmer-picked-battle-over-shadow-ministers-on-picket-lines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/28/why-has-keir-starmer-picked-battle-over-shadow-ministers-on-picket-lines","fields":{"headline":"Why has Keir Starmer picked battle over shadow ministers on picket lines?","trailText":"Analysis: Labour leader seeks to enforce authority in bid to move away from Corbyn era and show voters a united party","byline":"Peter Walker","body":"<p>It is 2022, not 1978, and yet the dominant story about Labour in the last few days has revolved around picket lines and the party’s union links. As one slightly bemused internal observer put it: “It does seem like an odd battle to pick.”</p> <p>So why have Keir Starmer and his team decided to bar shadow ministers from formally supporting strikers on picket lines, even if action taken against them if they do is, at best, haphazard? As ever with such tussles, it depends where you start.</p> <p>One useful beginning point is to note that the dismissal that catapulted the issue back into the news, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer\">of the junior shadow transport minister Sam Tarry</a>, was not officially because he joined a rail strike picket line.</p> <p>Tarry lost his frontbench role, Starmer said on Friday, because he booked himself on to a morning round of TV interviews without checking with Labour HQ, and then “made up policy on the hoof” by saying workers could not accept below-inflation pay rises.</p> <p>Behind this is the fact that Tarry was, before entering parliament, an officer for the TSSA transport union, and that he is engaged in a brutal battle with sections of his local Labour party, who are seemingly seeking to deselect him as an MP.</p> <p>Another point to stress is that while shadow ministers are still requested to not join picket lines, doing so will not see them automatically shunted from the frontbench. As Starmer said on Wednesday, the party will take “each case as it comes”, and several MPs with junior roles have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/28/labour-frontbenchers-rmt-rail-strike-pickets\">remained in their posts</a> despite infractions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff9c913b844cfd07c31cc62ef93a4d54fad898d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff9c913b844cfd07c31cc62ef93a4d54fad898d8/0_45_2680_1608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Tarry, right, with the RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, at an official picket line in Euston, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Tarry, right, with the RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, at an official picket line in Euston, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why bother? The broad answer is that last month, when the UK’s biggest rail strikes in 30 years took place, Labour hoped to blunt attacks from Boris Johnson, then firmly in power, that the party was somehow complicit in the disruption.</p> <p>Johnson and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, repeatedly labelled the stoppages “Labour’s strikes” because of the party’s traditional union links, also rehashing the slightly anachronistic notion of “union barons” who supposedly control its policy via their financial might.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>While a rash of shadow ministers on picket lines would have arguably augmented such a narrative, it was an attack that never properly took hold, with some in Labour now worrying that the ban actually drew more attention to those who did attend.</p> <p>Similarly, there is some confusion as to why vocally supporting a strike is deemed acceptable, but not if done so from a picket line. People of Starmer’s and Shapps’s generation have vivid memories of the robust mass picketing of the 1980s, but they are notably tamer affairs now. As one shadow frontbencher put it: “We liaise with unions in all sort of ways, and physically being on a picket line is a very small part of that, if it happens at all.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/keir-starmer-sacking-of-sam-tarry-a-severe-mistake-says-john-mcdonnell\">Keir Starmer’s sacking of Sam Tarry a severe mistake, says John McDonnell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The policy is part of Starmer’s effort to very firmly shove Labour away from what he and his team see as the overly traditionalist approach taken under Jeremy Corbyn, but must also be seen in the broader context of leftwing parties that emerged from union links having to reinvent themselves in an era of evolved class and work distinctions.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important reason for the policy is unity. Polling might be mixed on whether voters support strikers or bosses, but they tend to be consistent in showing people are put off by parties seen as riven by splits, as is happening now with the Conservatives.</p> <p>Starmer cited the idea of collective responsibility in his decision to remove Tarry, and he has repeatedly sought to enforce his authority, a pattern dating to his first months as Labour leader when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/25/keir-starmer-sacks-rebecca-long-bailey-from-shadow-cabinet\">sacked Rebecca Long-Bailey</a>, a key Corbyn ally, as shadow education secretary in a row linked to antisemitism.</p> <p>With a wave of potential strikes in a series of industries and public services looming over the autumn and winter, the arguably niche battle about picket lines is not about to go away. But now Starmer has imposed his rule, the best he can hope for is that if shadow ministers do ignore it, so too do most of the public.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/jul/28/two-third-of-uk-drivers-cut-back-on-car-use-or-other-spending-says-aa-motoring-fuel-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T14:50:40Z","webTitle":"UK drivers cut back on car use or other spending amid high fuel prices, says AA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/28/two-third-of-uk-drivers-cut-back-on-car-use-or-other-spending-says-aa-motoring-fuel-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/jul/28/two-third-of-uk-drivers-cut-back-on-car-use-or-other-spending-says-aa-motoring-fuel-prices","fields":{"headline":"UK drivers cut back on car use or other spending amid high fuel prices, says AA","trailText":"Survey of motoring group members shows almost two-thirds drove less or reduced spending in other areas","byline":"Rob Davies","body":"<p>Nearly two-thirds of motorists either drove less during July, or cut back their spending in other areas, said the AA, as record petrol prices hit drivers in the pocket.</p> <p>Young people and families felt the greatest impact, according to a survey by the motoring organisation, which warned of a knock-on effect hurting industries such as leisure and retail.</p> <p>Fuel prices hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/04/why-are-uk-fuel-prices-at-a-record-high-when-cost-of-oil-has-fallen\">record levels in early July</a>, with petrol reaching 191.5p a litre and diesel rising above £2 in some regions, owing to factors including high oil prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and low refining-capacity across Europe.</p> <p>Motoring groups have also claimed petrol retailers are not passing on the savings they make when wholesale fuel prices come down. While prices have fallen since early July, the AA said stubbornly high prices had already taken an economic toll.</p> <p>In a survey of more than 15,000 members, nearly two-thirds (64%) said they had cut back either on car use or other discretionary spending. That was a significant increase on the 43% who said they were doing so at the time of the last survey in November, when prices at the pump were 45p a litre cheaper.</p> <p>A quarter of younger drivers said they had run up debt or turned to family or friends for help in response to higher fuel costs, the AA said. It said 16% of “family-age” (25-34) people had turned to loans or credit cards and that 14% had been supported by family and friends.</p> <p>Among those drivers cutting back on areas other than fuel, 81% said they were eating out less and 67% said they had reduced their spending on weekly shopping. That 67% increased to 76% among drivers in the lowest-income group.</p> <p>However, actual car use had remained at 95% of pre-pandemic levels, according to the AA. It said people were unable to cut back on “essential” trips such as commuting or the school run but were instead finding ways to drive more efficiently.</p> <p>“While many drivers have learned to live with record pump prices by changing the way they drive their cars and cutting back here and there, younger drivers and those most likely to have families have suffered much more,” said Luke Bosdet, the AA’s fuel price spokesperson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Younger drivers and those most likely with families have also had to cut other spending or go into debt. That has been the real tragedy of record pump prices.,” said Bosdet.</p> <p>“I think everyone has been surprised by how little record pump prices have impacted on car travel and petrol consumption, which is around 5% below normal levels.</p> <p>“It could well have been a different story had soaring road fuel costs happened in winter. However, the bottom line is that much of the continued car travel is for essential trips, such as commuting, school runs, weekly shopping and visiting relatives.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/jul/28/tour-de-france-femmes-2022-stage-five-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T14:50:30Z","webTitle":"Tour de France Femmes: Wiebes takes stage win after big crash – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/28/tour-de-france-femmes-2022-stage-five-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/jul/28/tour-de-france-femmes-2022-stage-five-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Tour de France Femmes: Wiebes takes stage win after big crash – as it happened","trailText":"Lorena Wiebes’s power proved decisive in a bunch sprint in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges while Marianne Vos stayed in the yellow jersey","byline":"Luke McLaughlin","body":"<div id=\"block-62e2a1e78f08dfdbf08d19f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T14:50:30.592Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>That’s all from me today </strong>after another exciting stage at the Tour de France Femmes. </p> <p>Thanks for reading and emailing in, and we’ll be back for more tomorrow for a rolling stage before the race hits the more intimidating climbs on Saturday and Sunday ... </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T14:52:59.375Z\">at 3.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62e2a13c8f08ff31eaefe8df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T14:46:54.252Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jeremy Whittle reports from Saint-Dié-des-Vosges:</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/28/tour-de-france-femmes-lorena-wiebes-takes-stage-five-as-crash-clatters-peloton-cycling\">Tour de France Femmes: Lorena Wiebes takes stage five as crash clatters peloton</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62e29fdf8f08dfdbf08d19cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T14:42:11.666Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Top five GC after stage five:</strong></p> <p>1) Vos 16hr 20mins 58secs<br>2) Persico +20secs<br>3) Niewiadoma +20secs<br>4) Longo Borghini +34secs<br>5) Moolman-Pasio +55secs</p> <p>So, Vos stretched her lead in GC with four bonus seconds on the line.

He could be jailed or fined.</p> <p>However, a high court judge also ruled that the businessman’s wife of 34 years, Hiroko Barclay, had failed to prove he was in contempt of court for not paying her a £100m divorce settlement.</p> <p>Lady Barclay argued Barclay had breached a judge’s order to pay her the money and had the means to pay but had not, and asked the judge to hand him a jail sentence.</p> <p>But Sir Jonathan Cohen found she had failed to prove to the criminal standard necessary that Barclay had enough funds to pay the sum, which should have been paid in two instalments by April.</p> <p>In making his ruling, he said: “My finding does not in any way reduce [the husband’s] liability.”</p> <p>The court heard evidence in a three-day hearing in which it was suggested that Barclay’s nephews, Aidan, Howard and Alistair Barclay, had “blocked” his attempts to access his funds.</p> <p>In his summing up, Charles Howard QC explained why a source of funding for Barclay was cut off. “It’s quite obvious that this all coincides with the war between the two sides of the family and this was the reason for the drying up.”</p> <p>In his judgment, Cohen was highly critical of the nephews, who run the Telegraph and who made several submissions to prevent the media reporting what they described as their confidential and private information.</p> <p>“It is striking that rather than assist in finding a solution to what should be a matter of honour to this family, they refuse to provide information, hiding behind the walls of the trust structure, while spending over £1m in subsidising [Barclay’s] legal fees and no doubt a very large sum on their own fees to try to avert the gaze of the media.”</p> <p>At the heart of the case is the highly complex financial arrangements governing the Barclay family empire as well as a feud between Frederick Barclay and his twin brother, David, and his sons.</p> <p>Cohen said the two brothers reorganised their vast fortune, estimated to be worth £6bn by the Sunday Times earlier this year, in order to “remove tax liabilities arising in life or in death [which] took the form of a web of highly complex offshore arrangements”.</p> <p>The court heard how Frederick Barclay had given up half of his 50% share in the business to his brother’s sons, something his wife told the court he had described as “the greatest mistake of his life”.</p> <p>In his ruling, Cohen said Barclay had felt “overwhelmed by his brother’s pressure” to change the succession plans: “The potential for the nephews ganging up together and sidelining Amanda [Barclay’s daughter] should have been obvious.”</p> <p>Bitter tensions burst into the open in January 2020 when Barclay sued his nephews for bugging thousands of his private conversations in the Ritz hotel.</p> <p>The court heard that Barclay has only one asset in his name – a half share of the island of Brecqhou that was described as “worthless” in court because of the complicated ownership structure – and only one bank account. His wealth was instead put into a series of offshore trusts. Between 2014 and 2019, Barclay was able to access £128m from these to spend, the court heard.</p> <p>However, in September 2019 “the nephews turned off the tap” of funds to their uncle, said the judge.</p> <p>Hiroko Barclay alleged this was a “sham” designed by her ex-husband to ensure she received no money after filing for divorce in March 2019 but Cohen found no evidence of that.</p> <p>The court heard that Aidan Barclay, by far the largest shareholder of the four children, had told her he had “no love” for his uncle or Amanda because of the expensive legal proceedings in which Frederick Barclay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jun/04/barclay-family-calls-truce-to-end-ritz-espionage-case-in-high-court\">took his nephews to court</a> having found that his private conversations in the Ritz hotel had been bugged.</p> <p>Cohen described Hiroko Barclay’s suspicions as “understandable” given Barclay’s insistence to “minimise taxes and keep control himself”. For only a short time during their marriage did his wife own an asset in her own name, a house.</p> <p>Hiroko Barclay told the court she feared her husband simply wanted to string the legal procedure out until “one or other of us dies”.</p> <p>Barclay needs to pay the £245,000 by 11 August to avoid a potential prison sentence of up to six weeks.</p> <p>His ex-wife’s legal fees now amount to £900,000 with her legal team agreeing to work for nothing for this week’s hearing. Barclay’s nephews have paid his legal fees, by way of a loan, while also paying for their own team, which included two barristers and Heather Rogers QC, a director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information.<strong> </strong></p> <p>• This story, including the headline, was amended on 28 July 2022 to clarify that Frederick Barclay could face jail over one of the rulings – the one relating to the £245,000 in maintenance costs and legal fees – but not the ruling in relation to the £100m divorce settlement.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/28/labour-policy-strikes-sam-tarry-sacking","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T14:49:20Z","webTitle":"‘Labour risks taking the left’s votes for granted’: readers on Tarry sacking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/labour-policy-strikes-sam-tarry-sacking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/28/labour-policy-strikes-sam-tarry-sacking","fields":{"headline":"‘Labour risks taking the left’s votes for granted’: readers on Tarry sacking","trailText":"After Sam Tarry was sacked after broadcast interviews from picket lines, Guardian readers share their views on the party’s policy on strikes","byline":"Guardian readers","body":"<p>Sam Tarry, shadow transport minister and MP for Ilford, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer\">was sacked as a Labour frontbencher</a> on Wednesday after taking part in broadcast interviews from a rail strikes picket line.</p> <p>Keir Starmer has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/labours-sam-tarry-joins-rail-workers-on-picket-line-in-defiance-of-keir-starmer\">warned shadow ministers not to join picket lines</a>, although several did so during the last rail strikes in June and did not lose their jobs. However, unlike Tarry they did not take part in media appearances unapproved by the Labour party.</p> <p>Here, readers share their views on the sacking and Labour’s policy on the strikes.</p> <h2>‘Labour run the risk of taking the left’s votes for granted’</h2> <p>Seems to me that [Tarry] was sacked due to the unplanned/unapproved media pieces, rather than for just joining the strikes as many other Labour MPs have done, without being sacked. That being said, I still disagree with it. Keir’s Labour is blatantly trying to woo dismayed and disappointed Tory supporters, and in doing so are not taking a typical and expected Labour stance of supporting the unions, and supporting strikes over what are real-term pay cuts.</p> <p>However they run the risk of taking the left’s votes for granted. They expect the left-leaning person to vote for them as they’re the only real chance to get the Tories out, but they’ve become so centralist, their lack of support is almost anti-left, and anti-working class. <strong>Josh Olivero, 29, video games producer, Portsmouth – Labour supporter</strong></p> <h2>‘Tarry needed to be disciplined’</h2> <p>Sam Tarry’s interview was a piece of self-indulgence which undermined the carefully crafted messages by the Labour frontbench on the strikes. At a time when the whole team should be focused on the governments current shambles he needed to be disciplined.</p> <p>Trying to phrase it as anti-union plays into the hands of this trying to undermine Labour and its successful efforts to become a credible government in waiting after the Corbyn debacle. <strong>Dave Tiplady, retired, Sheffield – occasional Labour supporter</strong></p> <h2>‘Labour needs to be in power’</h2> <p>The British public, rightly or wrongly, want their PM and cabinet to not be standing next to a lot of union people on a picket line. They want them to lead for the benefit of the wider public. To be standing with union officials just misses the point. Corbyn and his cabinet did that over and over again and the country repaid Labour with their worst defeat in almost a century.</p> <p>Starmer is dull but Labour needs to be in power – to do that they need to look and feel like it. <strong>Penny Smith, retired, Marazion – occasional Labour supporter</strong></p> <h2>‘Labour leadership’s distancing from unions is an abandonment of Labour principles’</h2> <p>The Labour party’s roots are in the labour movement. It’s totally incomprehensible to me that anyone on the frontbench should be castigated for supporting the unions. After years of austerity and a real drop in income for the lowest earners, it’s the unions’ job to defend workers’ rights.</p> <p>The vilification of the unions by today’s rightwing Tories is totally out of touch and outdated. And the Labour leadership’s distancing from the unions is an abandonment of Labour principles, which may well come back to bite them at the next election. <strong>Kate Roberts, </strong><strong>international development consultant, Hampshire – Labour supporter</strong></p> <h2>‘Labour needs to show discipline and unity’</h2> <p>If the shadow cabinet, and the Labour party, want to be taken seriously as a party of government they need to show discipline and unity. The government is in disarray but rather than taking advantage of this, the Labour party factions are fighting among themselves.</p> <p>Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner have made the Labour party electable but they are undermined by those who fight the leadership more ferociously than they fight the Tories. It would be an enormous betrayal of the British people if the Labour party is unable to provide a powerful credible alternative to a corrupt incompetent government. <strong>Lloyd Davies, 66, small business director, Stevenage – Labour party member</strong></p> <h2>‘Labour lacks the courage to actually support workers’</h2> <p>The Labour party stopped being a workers’ party a long time ago. Keir Starmer seems to want to play it safe in order to win elections – he is good at attacking the Tories, but under his leadership the Labour party lacks the courage to actually support workers.</p> <p>I believe it was wrong of Starmer to sack Tarry for joining strikers on the picket line and to do so under a flimsy excuse. Starmer ought to ask himself if and how he can restore what ought to be the essence of the Labour party: standing with workers. <strong>Sonja Wolf, 47, Academic researcher, London – doesn’t support any political party</strong></p> <h2>‘I’m worried Starmer has gone too far to the right to attract votes’</h2> <p>At a time when, more than ever, people claim there’s no difference between Labour and Conservatives, this was a chance for Starmer to show that Labour support the working class, back the strikes, and legitimise the claims for better pay and conditions for everyone. Instead, he sacks Tarry for attending a picket line (even though it’s dressed up as a policy matter) in an attempt to convince fringe Tory voters that he’s someone they can vote for.</p> <p>I’ve always supported Starmer, even though he’s far more centrist than I want in a Labour leader. He’s sensible, intelligent, honest, and ethical, all qualities I’d hoped could win Labour a general election. Now though, I’m worried he’s gone too far to the right in a bid to attract votes. We need a leader who can convince workers in all fields that Labour will be looking out for their rights. <strong>Hugh Parker, 51, Architect, Ayrshire – Labour party member</strong></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/28/tour-de-france-femmes-lorena-wiebes-takes-stage-five-as-crash-clatters-peloton-cycling","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T14:45:03Z","webTitle":"Tour de France Femmes: Lorena Wiebes takes stage five as crash clatters peloton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/28/tour-de-france-femmes-lorena-wiebes-takes-stage-five-as-crash-clatters-peloton-cycling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/28/tour-de-france-femmes-lorena-wiebes-takes-stage-five-as-crash-clatters-peloton-cycling","fields":{"headline":"Tour de France Femmes: Lorena Wiebes takes stage five as crash clatters peloton","trailText":"Marianne Vos finished third on the day to keep hold of yellow jersey, while a multi-rider crash held up the main bunch of riders up for almost three minutes","byline":"Jeremy Whittle in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges","body":"<p>The longest stage in the modern history of women’s World Tour racing climaxed with a victory for the winner of the shortest stage in the 2022 Tour de France Femmes, Lorena Wiebes of Team DSM.</p> <p>The Dutch sprinter, winner of the Tour’s opening 81km circuit race on the Champs Élysées last Sunday, powered past race leader Marianne Vos to take her second win on the eve of a trio of mountain stages.</p> <p>“That was the last opportunity for the sprinters I think,” Wiebes said, adding that she felt pressure. “I’m very happy I took the win.

It was a long stage, hectic until the final, but the whole team did a great job.”</p> <p>The four-rider escape, which took shape with 142km to race, was composed of Victoire Berteau, Antri Christoforou, Emily Newsom and Anya Louw.</p> <p>As they rode the rolling roads of the Meurthe-et-Moselle, past camper vans, sound systems, giant flags and picnicking roadside crowds, the stage had a festival vibe that was typical of any edition of the men’s Tour de France.</p> <p>But with 50km to race, a mass crash saw half the field entangled on the tarmac on a stretch of straight road and the quartet of leaders increasingly optimistic of staying clear to the finish in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. With so many riders on the ground, some injured and many struggling to move off again, it took several minutes for most of them to get going again.</p> <p>“It’s really horrible seeing so many girls on the floor,” the Isle of Man cyclist Lizzie Holden, riding for Le Col-Wahoo, said after the stage. “You see some that don’t move for ages. It’s crazy and it’s really not nice to see. It’s part of bike racing, but we still come back every day. I’m a bit scared in the peloton at times so after things like that, I tend to hold back a bit more,” Holden admitted.</p> <p>When the dust settled, Denmark’s Emma Norsgaard had abandoned with a suspected broken collarbone, while Silvia Persico, who had started the stage second overall, to Vos, had required a bike change and only rejoined the main peloton after a prolonged chase.</p> <p>Another faller was the former Italian national champion, Marta Bastianelli, who battled on through tears to rejoin the main peloton.</p> <p>But as they approached the final climb of the day, the Col du Haut Bois, the peloton picked up speed leaving Berteau and Christoforou alone with the main field now regrouped and in pursuit. Although the pair worked hard to keep their lead, with the peloton riding at speeds of around 60km/h, the catch took place inside the last three kilometres, ending their 140km escape and setting up the inevitable sprint finish.</p> <p>“The last three stages were pretty hard,” Wiebes said. “Everyone feels the legs a bit. Last year in the Giro, I felt more fresh after a couple days. It has been full-gas racing.</p> <p>“I think it’s exciting to watch. I’m excited to see what happens tomorrow. Maybe a break will win, and then we head into the mountains and we’ll see the battle for the GC.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/28/tour-de-france-femmes-2022-stage-five-live-updates\">Tour de France Femmes: Wiebes takes stage win after big crash – live reaction</a> </p> </aside>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2022/jul/28/trevor-noah-instagram-late-night-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T14:38:46Z","webTitle":"Trevor Noah on Instagram: ‘Everything is an ad, and your feed is full of people you don’t follow’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/28/trevor-noah-instagram-late-night-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/jul/28/trevor-noah-instagram-late-night-tv","fields":{"headline":"Trevor Noah on Instagram: ‘Everything is an ad, and your feed is full of people you don’t follow’","trailText":"Late-night hosts discuss the backlash from users and the Kardashians, and the DoJ investigation of Trump","byline":"Guardian staff","body":"<h2><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></h2> <p>Trevor Noah looked into why Instagram “sucks” lately, causing many followers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/26/instagram-changes-user-backlash-trying-to-be-tiktok\">publicly complain</a> about the un-usability of the app. “Everything is an ad, and your feed is full of people you don’t follow,” the Daily Show host said on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>“Which is so confusing – I’m scrolling, and I start reading someone’s post and I’m like, ‘Do I know this person?

It seems so. Not even the bears add tension in this basic Netflix ‘thriller’","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<p>It is an odd time to be launching a survival drama such as Netflix’s new six-part miniseries Keep Breathing. After all, there is not much you could do to a lone survivor of a plane crash that would not feel restful compared to coping with normal life in 2022.</p> <p>Certainly, the premise of Keep Breathing is undermined from the start by the fact that the Canadian wilderness into which Liv (Melissa Barrera) – a tough, young lawyer – crash-lands looks idyllic. Sure, you would rather be there with a little more food and firestarters than the two power bars and soggy lighter that is Liv’s lot by the time she has swum ashore. The extroverts among you may like more company than a dying co-pilot, too. But overall it looks like a win. Even when a bear turns up and eats the bars, I shrugged and thought: if it is a choice between that or monkeypox and Liz Truss for PM – well, hello, my ursine friend.</p> <p>Even without being hamstrung by context, there is not much to detain you here. Keep Breathing is determinedly basic stuff. There is no question that Liv will escape the downed plane (she hitched a ride with two guys on a light aircraft after her commercial flight was cancelled). There is no question that the surviving pilot will die just after uttering the news that no one knew their flight plan and so no one is coming to rescue them. And there is no question that this will be confirmed when she rescues their kitbags from the submerged plane and finds them full of money and tubs of opiates. They were drug-smuggling across the border in their rickety private plane! Who knew? Everyone except Liv.</p> <p>Any tension there is in Liv’s remarkably non-urgent fight for survival – it takes her until day three to start looking for food, despite the bear eating her power bars early doors – is further dissipated by flashbacks. These appear whenever Liv is ticking off another survivalist drama trope – making a tourniquet, making a raft, waving a signalless phone in the air, screaming into an abyss – or when she is panting against a log, recovering from one of these endeavours going wrong.</p> <p>It is an interesting tactic in a robinsonade, to swerve away from all the times the protagonist might be working out how to stay alive. It is the genre that best proves the director George Roy Hill’s dictum that “audiences love how-to”.<strong> </strong>Instead, we get hazy shots of parties full of twentysomething lawyers, which we have seen more often than we have seen someone skinning a rabbit with a stiletto heel, or electrocuting a lake full of fish with an iPhone battery, or whatever else Liv could be doing.</p> <p>These flashbacks fill us in on what appears to be a terrifically simple backstory, which builds without suspense or making much sense of what little we have learned of Liv before her boring adventure began. She was on the last leg of a journey from New York to Inuvik, in the Northwest Territories of Canada, presumably to reunite with the writer of the beribboned bundle of letters in her hand luggage.</p> <p>Why the need to flee? The glimpses of her past reveal a romance with a colleague (Danny, played by Jeff Wilbusch) that presumably went wrong – there is an almost-genuine twist at the end of the first episode that suggests how – and caused her to leave the city, her job and an important case.</p> <p>She also got drunk and nearly died in an accidental fire after her father died, although whether this is meant to suggest she is an alcoholic is unclear. Also, there was an earth-mother figure in her childhood – possibly her mother – who is probably the person she is running to in Inuvik, if only she could make some trainers out of bark and bear spoor and work out how not to starve to death.</p> <p>I suspect we are meant to marvel at the doughty resourcefulness that lives in Liv, beneath the glamorous lawyer attire and, er, witty banter (it is agony) that comprise her life before, and ponder the primitive that lives within us all. </p> <p>There is a sense of punches being pulled all along, probably because of budget restrictions (the plane crash is mostly suggestive blackouts and sounds of splashing). Rather than perch on the edge of your seat, you are more likely to drift off gently to sleep, perhaps dreaming of a pleasant holiday in a log cabin, and wake up when it is all over.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2022/jul/28/post-your-questions-for-hot-chip","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T14:17:22Z","webTitle":"Post your questions for Hot Chip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/28/post-your-questions-for-hot-chip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/jul/28/post-your-questions-for-hot-chip","fields":{"headline":"Post your questions for Hot Chip","trailText":"As the beloved dance-pop band release their eighth album, Joe Goddard and Al Doyle will answer your questions – post them below","byline":"Laura Snapes","body":"<p>Two decades after their formation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/hot-chip\">Hot Chip</a> have pretty much achieved national treasure status for their playful, soulful, sometimes biting, sometimes lovelorn take on dance pop.

Here’s how to ensure yours doesn’t wither in your absence, however long you’re away","byline":"Jane Perrone","body":"<h2><strong>Containers</strong></h2> <p>Pots, hanging baskets and growbags are the parts of your garden most likely to take a hit during a summer absence: small soil volumes dry out quickly and need watering daily in hot weather, otherwise you’ll come home to a crispy mess. If you have a friend or neighbour willing to pop over and water, this is ideal: make the deal more tempting by offering to reciprocate when they go away, and invite them to pick any flowers and edible crops that would otherwise go to waste.</p> <p>If this isn’t possible, the next best option is to install a self-watering system: this can be as simple as <a href=\"https://www.allotmentbook.co.uk/bottle-top-watering-spikes/\" title=\"\">watering spikes</a> attached to water-filled plastic drinks bottles or wine bottles planted in individual pots, but you can also attach a <a href=\"https://www.greenhousesensation.co.uk/click-drip-for-water-butt.html/\" title=\"\">soaker hose on a timer</a> to a water butt or outdoor tap. If you have lots of valuable plants in pots, a computerised self-watering system you can <a href=\"https://www.gardena.com/uk/products/watering/water-controls/water-control-bluetooth/970481501/\" title=\"\">monitor remotely from an app</a> can be a worthwhile investment. </p> <p>If this feels too much like hard work, your best bet is to soak everything thoroughly before you go, then huddle containers and hanging baskets together in a shady spot away from walls so they can catch any rainfall. Place a gravel-filled drip tray underneath pots to catch water and allow it to be absorbed. Add a layer of bark or gravel mulch several centimetres deep to the top of pots to slow down evaporation and stop competition from weeds. Got pots that can’t be moved? Protect them from the sun with old net curtains or horticultural fleece.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Your best bet is to soak containers thoroughly before you go</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Flowerbeds</strong></h2> <p>These are less vulnerable than containers during holidays, because they can absorb any rainfall more easily, and roots can reach far into the ground to draw up moisture. Rather than giving everything a quick spray, focus your watering on plants most likely to suffer in a drought, such as shrubs and trees planted in the past few months as well as summer bedding. Give these a deep soak, directing water to the base of the plant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02ccf7f58a1b1c7825519e3c67dec1a3159c6454\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02ccf7f58a1b1c7825519e3c67dec1a3159c6454/0_620_10240_6144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"English Country garden on overcast summer’s day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don’t worry too much about flowerbeds, where roots can reach more deeply to find moisture.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillett/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you have spent money on a new tree and plan to go away often, it’s worth investing in a <a href=\"https://www.barcham.co.uk/store/products/tree-hydration-bag-premium\" title=\"\">tree hydration bag</a> to make sure your new addition isn’t denied water during its vital settling-in period. Deadhead flowers and remove weeds to make sure plants aren’t facing extra stress from competition. Mulching after watering will also help to hold in moisture.</p> <h2><strong>Vegetable gardens and allotments</strong></h2> <p>Harvest and preserve as much as you can before you go, as anything that ripens in your absence will go to waste. Right now, that includes salad leaves, courgettes, beans, peas, chillies, tomatoes and soft fruit such as strawberries and blueberries. Remove as many weeds as you can, water, then mulch beds with grass clippings, homemade compost or straw.</p> <h2><strong>Lawns</strong></h2> <p>Grass is incredibly tough: it usually bounces back quickly from drought, so don’t panic about this part of the garden. If you’ve kept going with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/no-mow-may-show-us-your-wilder-garden-lawns-wildlife\" title=\"\">No Mow May</a>, there is no reason to start cutting now, but if your lawn has been regularly mown, give grass a trim with the mower blades set high – think a light trim rather than a buzz cut – and save fertiliser and other lawn treatments until you return.</p> <p>If you have a robotic mower, do you just leave it to carry on while you holiday? Most models can be left to mow as usual, as they are fitted with an alarm and a security code system that locks the machine after a few failed attempts, and some can be monitored remotely via an app.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Grass is incredibly tough: it usually bounces back quickly from drought, so don’t panic about this part of the garden</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2> <p>Gardens left with high-value items on display can be a target for thieves, so be sure to lock tools, ladders, mowers, ornaments, furniture and anything else of value away, securely and out of sight. If you have large pieces of furniture, barbecues or sculptures that cannot be moved, secure them in place with <a href=\"https://www.screwfix.com/c/security-ironmongery/ground-wall-anchors/cat810348\" title=\"\">heavy-duty ground or wall anchors</a>. Move wheelie bins away from boundaries to stop people using them to climb over, and cover shed and garage windows so the contents are not on display. Sheds’ weak points are often the hinges – so even if you have an expensive padlock, add <a href=\"https://securityforbikes.com/beef-up-kit.php\" title=\"\">coach bolts</a> to make the hinges much harder to remove.</p> <h2><strong>Wildlife</strong></h2> <p>Most wildlife will be unbothered by your absence, but don’t leave hazards in place: pack away sports netting to stop birds and hedgehogs getting stuck, and ensure fruit cage netting is properly secured. If someone is coming to water, ask them to refill bird feeders and baths. If not, extra large feeders that can hold two or three litres of food will keep the supply going for longer (like the 2.7 litre <a href=\"https://shopping.rspb.org.uk/bird-feeders-boxes-tables/bird-feeders/seed-feeders-wild-birds/flo-festival-high-capacity-seed-feeder.html\" title=\"\">Flo Festival feeder</a> from the RSPB). Leaving several dishes of water at ground level around the garden in shady spots should help to provide water for wildlife.</p> <h2><strong>Greenhouses</strong></h2> <p>Greenhouses are one of the trickiest parts of the garden to leave during a holiday, so ask visiting waterers to prioritise this space when popping into your garden. If you don’t have someone to check in, leave all windows and vents open, and move plants off staging and on to the floor so they are shaded from the sun. If that’s not possible, add netting or shade paint to protect plants and keep them from frying.</p> <h2><strong>Ponds</strong></h2> <p>Check filters and pumps are running smoothly and filters are clean before you go, but leave waterfalls and fountains running so the water stays aerated if you have fish. Remove any debris from the surface of the water, then top up to the maximum level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6fca433954bf6b046b1980bb7e7c8194fe5a57d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6fca433954bf6b046b1980bb7e7c8194fe5a57d/0_0_10377_6228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succulents and cactus blooming flowers in hothouse credit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cacti and succulents can last without water for several weeks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillett/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Houseplants</strong></h2> <p>Most houseplants will not need any extra attention if left for a week or so – just be sure to water thoroughly before leaving, allowing pots to drain so they are not left sitting in stagnant water. Cacti and succulents can last without water for several weeks, but for longer trips, grouping plants together away from windows allows them to slow down photosynthesis and eke out their supply of water.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If you go away regularly, it’s worth investing in some self-watering devices for houseplants</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Tropical plants and ferns can be placed on a wet towel (or capillary matting if you have it) in the bath, shower tray or sink – some growers even stretch a sheet of clingfilm over the sink or bath to form a mini greenhouse. Individual specimens can be placed in large clear plastic bags to create the same effect. If you go away regularly, it’s worth investing in some self-watering devices for houseplants: there are numerous options that work well, including water spikes made from terracotta or plastic; water globes and self-watering planters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Balconies and terraces</strong></h2> <p>If you have pots on balconies or on window boxes and are taking a longish trip, bring smaller pots inside and group them on a plastic tarpaulin to protect your floor; for shorter jaunts, or containers you cannot move, erecting some protection from drying winds and sun will help, even it’s just an old sheet.

Thomas Dunne, the chief superintendent of the Dublin Metropolitan police until 1922, was Barry’s great-grandfather. A loyal servant of the British Crown, he was considered a traitor – a “Castle Catholic” – in the wake of Irish independence. </p> <p>When we meet Dunne (Owen Roe) he is an old man in an asylum in the 1930s, grieving his many losses and haunted by memories of his son, killed in the first world war. Wearing grubby long johns, in a cell-like room, he is visited by an aggressive orderly, Smith (Cillian Ó Gairbhí), who relishes reminding him that the world has changed and there is no place for him in the new dispensation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://anuproductions.ie/about/team/\">Louise Lowe</a>’s production coincides with the 100th anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/event-to-mark-handover-of-dublin-castle-from-british-authorities-1.4776698\">handover of Dublin Castle to the new Irish provisional government</a>, after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.</p> <p>In the years since this play’s celebrated premiere in 1995, Barry’s whole body of work has been enormously significant in breaking the silence surrounding the Irish men who served in the Crown police force, or who died in service to the empire on the western front.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/01/sebastian-barry-im-still-not-over-oliver-twist\">Sebastian Barry: ‘I’m still not over Oliver Twist’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Full of regret, Dunne recalls his father’s harshness, while feeling guilty about his treatment of his own son. Father and son relationships are central here, to the extent that Dunne’s three daughters, played by Julie Crowe, Eavan Gaffney and Caroline Menton, are less fleshed out.

At 22 and 19, respectively, they’re both undeniable prodigies – the former a keyboardist who plays with the same speed, intensity and militant precision that most people her age use to text, the latter a drummer who could probably keep perfect time with the ECG of a cardiac arrest.</p> <p>They also have more in common with your average meme account admins than most artists signed to longstanding jazz label Blue Note: they refer to their rendition of John Coltrane’s My Favourite Things as My Favourite Ballsack; their spin on Coltrane’s Giant Steps is, of course, Giant Nuts; they once joked that their debut album would be called Pussy With Balls. To be a fan of Domi and JD Beck is to be constantly reminded of testicles – a recent show at the Hollywood Bowl was memorialised on Domi’s Instagram as a set at “the Hollywood Ballsack”.</p> <p>It’s a little puerile, sure. But it is Domi and JD Beck’s blithe disregard for convention, aesthetically and musically, that has made their debut album, Not Tight (released via Blue Note and Anderson .Paak’s label new Universal imprint Apeshit) one of the year’s most anticipated debuts. It’s what got them noticed in the first place.</p> <p>“When we were coming up as teenagers, [we were] around a lot of music that’s very slow,” says Beck, calling from Dallas. “You’ll go to a jam session and they’re playing, like, really slow R&amp;B.” Adds Domi: “And on the radio, everything is the same tempo.” Naturally, Beck says, when he and Domi first started playing, they felt the need to harness the energy that they were missing. “We wake up, and we gotta play fast,” says Domi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3c37a8719d952dd57f3c537519ad7aea60ce3ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3c37a8719d952dd57f3c537519ad7aea60ce3ea/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Domi and JD Beck with Anderson .Paak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Domi and JD Beck with Anderson .Paak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tehillah De Castro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Domi was born Domitille Degalle in Metz, north-east France. Jazz was big in her household: “Charlie Parker, Keith Jarrett, the standard swing jazz.” At five, she was enrolled at the Conservatoire Régional du Grand Nancy; later she was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris and Boston’s prestigious Berklee College of Music, though the latter hesitated to admit her because she hadn’t yet received her high school diploma. She began playing classical music, but it was the freedom and improvisational nature of jazz that she was most attracted to.</p> <p>Beck also began playing as a child, in Dallas, learning classical piano from the age of five and then drums. “I gravitated towards jazz because of the fast drums,” he says. “I grew up playing Led Zeppelin and the Police – it put me in that zone.” YouTube also proved helpful: he would watch “like, 10m videos” of iconic drummers such as <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Art-Blakey\" title=\"\">Art Blakey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Elvin_Jones.html\" title=\"\">Elvin Jones </a>and <a href=\"https://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Tony_Williams.html\" title=\"\">Tony Williams</a> to study their techniques.</p> <p>Both musicians became known as exceptional performers: Beck began playing with Erykah Badu’s band after the producer Jamal Cantero saw him at a jam session in Dallas, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMhUrNjAlI0\" title=\"\">footage of Domi blazing through Kendrick Lamar’s For Free</a> went viral. In 2018, a mutual friend enlisted the pair to perform in a product demonstration at an annual trade show designed to showcase music gear. They relay the story with the same frantic rhythm of their music: terrible gig, terrible instruments, terrible in-ear monitors. “It was like, the worst thing ever,” says Beck.</p> <p>Nonetheless, soon after, Degalle flew to Dallas to hang out with Beck. Videos of their jams caught the attention of jazz-adjacent luminary Thundercat, who enlisted them to play in his band, including during a 2020 Adult Swim performance featuring Ariana Grande and Anderson .Paak, who is now a mentor and close collaborator. “He just really understands us as people, and you don’t get that often,” says Beck.</p> <p>Paak performs on two songs on Not Tight and co-wrote Moon, a collaboration he brokered with jazz legend Herbie Hancock. Meanwhile, Domi and Beck co-wrote Skate, a single from Paak’s Grammy-sweeping collaboration with Bruno Mars, An Evening With Silk Sonic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJDARjzHhZE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EJDARjzHhZE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Not Tight glides so effortlessly – sometimes capturing the verdant airiness of anime scores or the plush haze of alternative Los Angeles hip-hop – that you might miss the irregularity of Beck’s drumming or the borderline-manic energy of Domi’s keys. The pair credit trips to LA with shifting their perspective on how their music should sound.</p> <p>“Being around pop stars opened us to where we were like, ‘Not everything is for, like, psycho jazz musicians who stay up until 8am,’” says Beck. “We would [be] playing in front of people who had no idea about anything musical at all. It made us think, ‘Should we be making music for the musician? Or should we just be making the best possible music we can make?’”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/24/herbie-hancock-miles-davis-told-me-i-dont-pay-you-to-get-applause\">Herbie Hancock: ‘Miles Davis told me: I don’t pay you to get applause’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not Tight, then, is not a perfect facsimile of those chaotic, jaw-dropping viral jam videos.

The ebullient Sextet has a pair of violas adding mellow sonorities without dimming the brightness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/02/chi-chi-nwanoku-classical-music-living-colour-black-orchestra-chineke-foundation\">Chi-chi Nwanoku</a>’s double bass acts as a springboard here, and <a href=\"https://www.tomposter.co.uk/\">Tom Poster</a> throws off gloriously dextrous piano figuration.</p> <p>The qualities that make the Sextet so appealing – that filigree lightness in the piano and the translucence of the music generally – make Fanny’s Trio sound initially rather opaque by comparison. Yet stick with the Trio and the balance rights itself. After the dark, tumultuous opening comes a pair of short middle movements with the kind of smiling melancholy that Elgar would do so well half a century later, with violinist <a href=\"https://www.elenaurioste.com/\">Elena Urioste</a> and cellist <a href=\"https://www.lauravanderheijden.uk/en\">Laura van der Heijden</a> duetting yearningly. The Quartet is lighter, and in the first movement there are times when it feels like the strings are there just to wind up the piano and watch it go; the middle movement is a gloriously louche barcarolle, the third is nonchalant yet restless, full of changing patterns that gently wrong-foot the listener. Fanny’s chamber music could stand alongside any of this period, not only her brother’s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1BEQyzeLFkle2QS3xaXyQ9?si=r_bjxp0eR0GNvSkX_fdOfA\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1BEQyzeLFkle2QS3xaXyQ9?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <h2>This week’s other pick</h2> <p>Colourise, on Orchid Classics, also features Urioste – this time as soloist in Vaughan Williams’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/08/the-lark-ascending-ralph-vaughan-williams-classical-chart-topper-jennifer-pike\">The Lark Ascending</a>, accompanied by the London Choral Sinfonia.

Chartered by the Scottish government, it is expected to host up to 1,700 people and is a temporary solution to a growing accommodation crisis, which earlier this month prompted the government to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/11/scotland-ukrainian-refugee-sponsorship-scheme-pause-lack-of-homes\">pause its Ukrainian refugee sponsorship scheme</a> for three months.</p> <p>Two-thirds of the more than 9,000 Ukrainians who have arrived in Scotland since war broke out in February applied under the scheme, which allowed people applying for a UK visa to select the Scottish government as a sponsor.</p> <p>The Scottish government said the ship was fully risk-assessed and all crew members had child and adult protection training as a minimum.

This vision of Metropolis is clean and horizon-less, presided over by billionaires with skyscrapers and the Justice League. A somewhat hapless Superman (John Krasinski) fixes emergencies in tandem with his canine companion Krypto (Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson), sent to earth as a puppy to look after the infant Kal-El. Krypto is as suitable for crime-fighting as his owner (flying, laser eyes, godly strength) but comically bad at being a dog – no sniffing, no running, and his poop smells like sandalwood.</p> <p>Concerned that the clingy, socially awkward Krypto will need a friend after he pops the question to Lois Lane (Olivia Wilde), Superman drags Krypto to a shelter and encounters Ace (Kevin Hart), a dog’s dog to Krypto’s unrelatable weirdo “Bark Kent”. (Super-Pets is thus another vehicle for the comedy odd couple that is The Rock and Hart, whose chemistry carries over even without the sight gag of their size contrast.) Ace has bided his time behind bars by convincing his fellow shelter rejects to look forward to nice life at a farm upstate. Said rejects include scheming hairless guinea pig Lulu (Kate McKinnon), a former lab rat for evil billionaire Lex Luthor (Marc Maron) who’s determined to follow through on her beloved owner’s dastardly plans.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jkw2JPCl18\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1jkw2JPCl18?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When Lulu manages to get her hands on some orange kryptonite – a derivative of the deadly green kind that only works on animals – she becomes an adorable (to her chagrin) diva villain, and accidentally turbocharges the abilities of the other shelter pets. Ace becomes indestructible, an unworthy shell for this tear-jerking past. People-pleasing potbellied pig PB (Vanessa Bayer), a superhero-fan girl, can change size. Neurotic squirrel Chip (Diego Luna) shoots electronic bolts. Wizened turtle Merton (Natasha Lyonne, perfectly dry) develops Flash-like superspeed but not the wherewithal to refrain from swearing in a kids movie (it’s never not funny, and all bleeped).</p> <p>None of them truly believe in themselves (yet), nor have a good handle on their abilities. But Krypto, rendered powerless and rattled by his bestie’s split affections, needs them to rescue “Supes” and the Justice League – misanthropic Batman (Keanu Reeves), brawny Wonder Woman (Jameela Jamil), Aquaman (Jemaine Clement), The Flash (John Early), Green Lantern (Dascha Polanco) and Cyborg (Daveed Diggs) – from Lulu and her genuinely funny army of souped-up guinea pigs. (Tto be clear, as Lulu is, these are not hamsters).</p> <p>The starry voice cast is without exception excellent, but McKinnon is a particular standout – the trailers underplay how central her devilishly endearing performance as Lulu is to the film’s fun. The cast’s vibrancy carries the film through the requisite action sequences and unremarkable animation that doubles down on the cute (the villain is, again, a squeaky guinea pig with a kitten sidekick who coughs up hairball grenades). Stern and Whittington’s vision of Metropolis isn’t quite as deliriously irreverent as in the Lego world, but the film has enough bite for older viewers. The slapstick humor and elastic physics – lots of explosions and destruction but no harm – are for children, the swipes at Musk-esque billionaires for adults (a news headline after Luthor’s arrest: “Wealthy Person Actually Goes to Jail”).</p> <p>True to its animated predecessors, Super-Pets pulls off what other superhero entries have struggled to summon from the CGI universe: lighthearted fun and self-aware humor woven with real evergreen themes – the fear of change, learning to love friends through transitions, trusting that love will remain through the seasons. The Super-Pets aren’t the most witty or cutting bunch – and no doubt destined to be plush toys on store shelves soon – but there’s little reason to resist the cute.</p> <ul> <li><p>DC League of Super-Pets is out in UK and US cinemas on 29 July</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/bernard-cribbins-a-warm-kindly-titan-of-childrens-entertainment","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T13:00:33Z","webTitle":"Bernard Cribbins: a warm, kindly titan of children’s entertainment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/bernard-cribbins-a-warm-kindly-titan-of-childrens-entertainment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/bernard-cribbins-a-warm-kindly-titan-of-childrens-entertainment","fields":{"headline":"Bernard Cribbins: a warm, kindly titan of children’s entertainment","trailText":"Over eight decades, Cribbins enthralled generations of young people.

Older viewers recognised the actor from the film; younger ones knew his voice from his narration of The Wombles, originally screened on BBC One from 1973-75 but repeated for decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f58ef16f39e7a8d6e6e6a7f0e5c9102808751188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f58ef16f39e7a8d6e6e6a7f0e5c9102808751188/0_0_4389_5779/759.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Cribbins and Jill Curzon star in Daleks’ Invasion Earth 2150AD.\" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernard Cribbins and Jill Curzon star in Daleks’ Invasion Earth 2150AD.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Appearing in shows with a long shelf life – because new child viewers arrive all the time – does not seem to have been a deliberate career strategy, but it gave Cribbins extraordinarily enduring recognisability. It helped that – as has notoriously turned out not to be the case with all stars of BBC children’s shows – no viewer would ever have hesitated to hire the warm, kindly Cribbins as a babysitter.</p> <p>Somewhat improbably, he also featured on Pick of the Pops, due to his comedy novelty records, including Hole in the Ground and Right Said Fred, which reached Nos 9 and 10 in the charts in 1962. Both were character solos, with Cribbins embodying the sort of bluff, baffled workman who was a feature of British streets and building sites at the time.</p> <p>Cribbins also achieved another footnote in music history when Fred and Richard Fairbrass formed a band called Right Said Fred, their song Deeply Dippy finally giving Cribbins an honorary UK No 1 in 1992. The Fairbrass brothers had been at primary school when Cribbins’ song came out, so were a perfect target audience, but their borrowed title remained on the playlist of radio shows aimed at children into this millennium: yet another example of Cribbins’ work engaging successive generations.</p> <p>Recognising this, Noel Edmonds, who often played the witty singles on his Radio 1 shows, employed Cribbins as Victor the Vicar, rector to the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom, in the hit 90s Saturday night show, Noel’s House Party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2022/jul/28/bernard-cribbins-a-life-in-pictures\">Bernard Cribbins: a life in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although his 2018 autobiography was self-deprecatingly called Bernard Who? 75 Years of Doing Just About Anything, the actor once had a name-branded comedy show: Cribbins (on ITV from 1969-70). It was also around the time he played his single most remembered screen role, as station porter Albert Perks in the original film of The Railway Children. Though Cribbins was still alive and working when this year’s sequel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/03/the-railway-children-return-review-family-classic-sequel-stays-on-track\">The Railway Children Return</a>, was made, a four-decade jump in the storyline effectively wrote out his character. In his brief peak as a movie star, Cribbins also, for contrast, made Alfred Hitchcock’s 1972 horror flick Frenzy. For the British film industry, he had numerous cameos in comedies, including as Midshipman Albert Poop-Decker in Carry On Jack.</p> <p>The highest tribute actors can have is that those who have worked with them wish to do so again. This loyal admiration led to a late-career highlight, when Russell T Davies cast him as the tinker Snout in a BBC One version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream.</p> <p>Davies was unsure if Cribbins would want to do Shakespeare, but he shouldn’t have been. It was well within his range, and brought his acting career almost full circle: his first West End theatre performance, in 1956, was as both Dromios in The Comedy of Errors. It was also fitting that he should play for Davies one of Shakespeare’s so-called “rude mechanicals”, as burly, surly manual labourers had been his most frequent casting from screen roles to pop songs.</p> <p>Cribbins, who was born into a poor Oldham family, left school at 13 to work in a local theatre, meaning he had a professional career of eight decades. The remarkable legacy of his charm and professionalism is that, on the day of his death, his name, face and voice will be familiar to audiences aged nine to 90.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 31 July 2022.

Best known for her standup, Martinez never planned on becoming a comedian – the original dream was to act, she says.</p> <p>Martinez, 44, is sitting outside London’s National Theatre, sipping from a water bottle. After a 22-year detour as an award-winning comedian who is volubly “wobbly” (the word she uses to describe her cerebral palsy), she has been delivered back to her first love. She is performing a leading role in the National’s <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/all-of-us\" title=\"\">All of Us</a>, directed by Ian Rickson, which also marks her playwriting debut. On a break from rehearsals, she is feeling relaxed. “I like a new challenge,” she says, petite and bright-eyed. “But,” she adds, her voice rising to raucousness, “childhood Francesca would be so flabbergasted that I’m doing this … as an actor!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of Us was commissioned after a single meeting with the National’s artistic director, Rufus Norris, who “took a chance” on Martinez. The play very nearly didn’t happen at all. Due to be staged in March 2020, it was shut down two days before its first show, as a result of the first Covid lockdown. “It felt like very cruel timing,” she says. “I went from gearing up to share the play with the world to sitting on my sofa in pyjamas watching Netflix.”</p> <p>All of Us is not a comedy, as you might expect, but a state-of-the-nation drama, revolving round a group of friends in austerity Britain, each struggling to live before they come together to demand accountability from those in power. Martinez has redrafted the play to include Covid, self-isolation and the strains of the past two years, though its backdrop is the legacy of austerity and the collateral damage to individual lives. Some characters facing cuts to their disability care are confined to their beds and become deeply depressed. Others are forced to wear incontinence pads because of the lack of night-time carers, or have benefits assessments that leave them unable to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ee6b96057783d53b90c2f18aa61f6b452e86d22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee6b96057783d53b90c2f18aa61f6b452e86d22/0_289_5750_3450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The company of All of Us in rehearsal at the National Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The company of All of Us in rehearsal at the National Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These stories, Martinez says, “are all based on real-life cases. What’s happening is so bad right now, I didn’t have to make it up. If anything, there are worse stories. When I first talked to the National I was, like: ‘Look, this is happening all around the country in silence.’ It feels to me like an epic crime that is taking place behind closed doors.”</p> <p>It’s a situation that Martinez was following closely long before the pandemic started. In 2014, she helped to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/26/francesca-martinez-comedian-welfare-cuts-disabled-people\">secure a landmark parliamentary debate</a> calling for an assessment of the impact that welfare reforms were having on sick and disabled people. That campaigning work exposed her to the woeful human cost of the cuts: “I was hearing about people taking their own lives, people struggling to eat, struggling to heat their homes. All those stories and experiences started to percolate in my head and I felt a real desire to shine a light with this play. I also wanted to explore the question of what makes those in power act the way they do.”</p> <p>Talking of power, we meet on the day of Boris Johnson’s resignation speech. Martinez is a former Labour supporter. While the characters in her play struggle to get through the pandemic, her own lockdown was not arduous. She caught up on sleep, exercised, read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/11/eckhart-tolle-interview-spirituality\" title=\"\">Eckhart Tolle</a> and embraced living in the moment. “I realised that all I have is now. You don’t know how long you have. Enjoy it.” She spent the time with her partner of 16 years, Kevin Hely, who also stars in the play as a war veteran with PTSD.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Standup is not something you can do if you’re not happy with yourself – and I was not happy with myself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Martinez has, in some ways, come full circle, having started out as an actor on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/grange-hill\" title=\"\">Grange Hill</a>. Her support teacher spotted the advert for it and she was desperate to get the part, not least because she wanted to escape her secondary school, which she loathed. Born into a supportive north London family (her father, of Spanish heritage, is a playwright, and her mother is an author and former journalist), she was an effervescent and assured child who loved performing – until she went to an all-girls secondary at the age of 11. By terrible coincidence I went to the same school a few years before her and we bond over our mutually unsavoury memories of it. “High school was a really difficult place,” she says. “I dreaded going in every morning so when Grange Hill happened, it was a lifeline thrown to me and I grabbed it with both hands.”</p> <p>Did she get bullied? “Yes there was that, but I also didn’t have any friends and felt very lonely. I knew I was wobbly, of course I did, but until that point it was just like having curly hair. It sounds mad, realising that you’re disabled, but it was more realising how the world saw it that was so shocking. The hardest thing in my life hasn’t been being wobbly, it’s been living in a world that can’t handle difference. Within a few months I’d lost all my self-esteem.”</p> <p>Did she want to perform in spite of her disability or because of it, given how the world saw her? “I’m sure it was partly tied to being wobbly and wanting to prove myself – that I could be funny, engaging, magnetic. Performing was a way of showing the world what I could do rather than being judged on what I couldn’t do. I developed a strong sense of humour: if I could make them laugh I would win their respect, somehow.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f5771e3f7f2e2f42152b1be679ec4d1deb6a6e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f5771e3f7f2e2f42152b1be679ec4d1deb6a6e0/0_0_4010_2406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor Crystal Condie and Francesca Martinez in rehearsal for All of Us.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Actor Crystal Condie and Francesca Martinez in rehearsal for All of Us.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After five series of Grange Hill, she was determined to keep acting, despite the dearth of parts. Her father wrote a film especially for her. “It never got made but he made my character a comedian. I remember reading it and going: ‘Dad, this is amazing. Julia Roberts would wobble it up to win an Oscar for this!’ But I asked him: ‘Why did you make me a standup comic? It’s so incredibly terrifying.’ He said he thought I’d be really good at it.”</p> <p>She didn’t believe him but signed up to a standup workshop at City Lit, in London, for research purposes: “I went full De Niro – so I could act the part. I stayed silent for six whole weeks in that workshop. It terrified me because what I could see, very clearly, was that standup is not something you can do if you’re not happy with yourself – and I was not happy with myself. Something in me knew that if I did it, I would have to, at some level, accept myself. I was still carrying around a lot of pain, insecurity and self-loathing created by that schooling experience.”</p> <p>But in week seven, she mustered her courage and did her first routine in class. “For the first time in public, I referred to myself as ‘wobbly’. Up until then I’d been so in denial and so ashamed that I hadn’t mentioned it. I did a whole routine about how hard it is to use drugs when you’re wobbly – and people laughed. In that moment I realised something very profound: I had spent years trying to be normal, to fit in and be accepted, but actually the way to acceptance is to accept yourself as you are.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237f23b710d43f61c712eb057290a4f0963d00c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237f23b710d43f61c712eb057290a4f0963d00c3/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bonnie Baddoo, Emma Tooze, Crystal Condie and Francesca Martinez in rehearsal for All of Us.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bonnie Baddoo, Emma Tooze, Crystal Condie and Francesca Martinez in rehearsal for All of Us.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She went straight home and told her parents: “Forget about the film. I want to do <em>this.</em>”<em> </em>Within the year, she had won the Open Mic award at the Edinburgh festival – becoming, in 2000, the first woman to do so – and it set her off on her stellar trajectory in standup: “It forces you to stand in front of a room of strangers and go: ‘This is me.’ It turns pain into laughter, which is beautiful and healing.”</p> <p>Martinez has continued to speak out over the years about the world’s selective vision around disability. In 2011, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/07/edinburgh-festival-francesca-martinez\">she revealed her dismay</a> about a TV sitcom pilot that stalled after having been in development with the BBC for five long years. At the time she said she didn’t understand the corporation’s nerves around it. Is it very different now? “Yes,” she says. “When I started out, there was a lot of fear around difference. In recent years I’ve seen that change to excitement and I think the industry has started to recognise that there are all these untapped stories and lives that haven’t been depicted before. There’s a real shift happening. It’s slow, but it’s happening.”</p> <p>The success of Tim Renkow’s outrageous BBC sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/02/jerk-series-two-review-still-the-most-outrageously-un-pc-comedy-on-tv\" title=\"\">Jerk</a> – the comedian has cerebral palsy – is testament to how far things have come in less than a decade. So would Martinez be able to create a TV show with a disabled character at its heart today?<strong> </strong>“Well, I am [writing one] at the moment,” she reveals. “Who knows if it will get made but I think there is real interest there. Ultimately, it’s not about ticking boxes; it’s about reflecting life as it is. That’s all increasing diversity is: not leaving out huge swathes of humanity.”</p> <p><em>All of Us </em><em>is at the National Theatre: </em><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/all-of-us\" title=\"\">Dorfman</a></em><em> to </em><em>24 September.</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 29 July 2022 to describe Martinez as a “former” Labour supporter.

Filmed at the height of Covid, it is directed and hosted by Ethan Hawke and threatens us with a long list of A-list actors appearing via Zoom to assume various characters. The source material – hundreds of hours of transcripts from interviews commissioned by Newman for a biography that never materialised – tells the story not just of the couple and their careers, but of an era, a marriage and an industry. All of which sounds fine, within its limitations. But who has the time or appetite for six hours of this stuff?</p> <p>As it turns out, watching The Last Movie Stars is an extraordinary experience. As a documentary, it’s different in form to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/25/the-beatles-get-back-review-peter-jackson-eight-hours-of-tv-so-aimless-it-threatens-your-sanity\">Peter Jackson’s Get Back</a>, the eight hours of recut studio footage from the Beatles’ 1969 recording session. The Last Movie Stars is a more conventional project, with commentary and talking heads intercut with archive footage from Newman and Woodward’s filmography. And yet the depth of the material and the sheer boldness of the show’s length invite a similar sense of immersion to Get Back. Newman burned all the audio tapes from which the transcripts derive, for reasons that, as the show progresses, become obvious: the revelations are so intimate, so startling and at times so devastating, it’s amazing they existed in the first place.</p> <p>George Clooney reads for Newman; Laura Linney for Woodward. Interviews with Gore Vidal, their great friend, are read brilliantly by Brooks Ashmanskas. Zoe Kazan – whose grandfather, Elia, directed Newman multiple times and features prominently in the material – reads for Jackie McDonald, Newman’s first wife. Newman and Woodward were beloved movie stars, but there is something about the granular level of the dive into their lives that almost renders the celebrity meaningless. The portrait of a marriage – not just of Newman and Woodward’s, but of the fallout from Newman’s marriage to McDonald – would, one suspects, be gripping even without the Hollywood shine.</p> <p>Of course, there’s a huge added frisson that comes from stars playing stars. When Newman discusses the vicissitudes of fame, you know that Clooney, conveying the actor’s words in his own unmistakable voice, is applying all the insights to himself. The series also captures an era in which, as Vidal puts it, one saw “the end of movies as the universal art form”. Upstaged in his early career by Marlon Brando and James Dean, beautiful but not smouldering, quiet, reticent, withholding and unsure of himself, Newman nonetheless rose to the level of icon. Unpicking how this happened, and how Newman – who says, at one point, “I had a struggle with confidence all my life” – overcame this, is like reading a very fine novel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/22/pop-culture-art-love\">How I stopped trying to keep up with pop culture - and found the art I really loved | Emma Garland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then there is the personal stuff. In one interview, Newman says that the first time he wept as an adult was at the birth of Nell, his first child with Woodward. The fact that he already had three children with McDonald requires no further commentary, although the presence in the documentary of Stephanie, one of his daughters with McDonald, feels, from a production view, like an incredible get. “They were so hot for each other,” she recalls of her father and stepmother, before talking about how “disgusted” she was with her dad for how he treated her mother, and allowing the viewer to understand that the story is much bigger than that. “Pop was a complicated guy.”</p> <p>The portrait of Woodward is even more fascinating. When the couple met, Woodward was the star; she had just won an Oscar for The Three Faces of Eve. Newman, meanwhile, could barely land a lead role. Over the years, the balance shifted. After the couple had children, Woodward found herself spending more and more time at home with the kids. “Why is Shirley MacLaine getting all those parts?” she says bitterly at one point, before making the admission, “If I had to do it all again, I might not have had children.” Hawke, with the sensitivity of a movie star who has been married to another movie star, says sagely: “Many of us lose our dreams. But most of us don’t have a partner who has the exact same dreams, and his come true.”</p> <p>The effect of all this – the accumulation of detail, the stunning visuals, the startling honesty of the transcripts, in which, at one stage, Newman says with rare insight for the time: “Being born white in America in 1925; that’s the beginning of the luck” – makes The Last Movie Stars one of the best TV programmes of the year so far. (No date is yet set for its broadcast in the UK.) Hawke, dishevelled while trying to find decent wifi in his house, marshals his famous pals in what, in less able hands, might have been a piece of self-indulgence. As it is, these six hours about art, and love, and ambition, and disappointment are utterly electrifying.</p> <ul> <li><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/jul/28/sarina-wiegman-unerringly-good-england-yet-to-revive-familiar-pain-womens-euro-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T13:00:07Z","webTitle":"Sarina Wiegman’s unerringly good England are yet to revive my familiar pain | Max Rushden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/28/sarina-wiegman-unerringly-good-england-yet-to-revive-familiar-pain-womens-euro-2022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/jul/28/sarina-wiegman-unerringly-good-england-yet-to-revive-familiar-pain-womens-euro-2022","fields":{"headline":"Sarina Wiegman’s unerringly good England are yet to revive my familiar pain","trailText":"Is age, unfamiliarity or deep-seated sexism sweeping me along to the Euro 2022 final without an agonising knot of nerves?","byline":"Max Rushden","body":"<p>In 2014, Cambridge United played Gateshead in the National League play-off Final.

The boys kicked a shoot size five around the green triangle on Tenison Road and the girls sat on the outside talking about stuff and listening to the Levellers or the Cure. If one of them kicked the ball back to us it was an event.</p> <p>Hopefully it’s more nuanced than that. I don’t spend a lot of time covering the women’s game. Most of the players are relatively new to me. There isn’t a history of this team causing me pain – I don’t have a playlist of soul-shattering BBC montages I can recite word for word from the past four decades (Euro ’96, to Cast’s Walkaway, is still so tough). And Sarina Wiegman’s team are unerringly good, so it doesn’t feel like they’ll let me down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c31888020e97d4558c39a88d2b920acc1c507a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c31888020e97d4558c39a88d2b920acc1c507a5/0_176_1330_798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Seaman consoles Gareth Southgate after the defender’s decisive miss in the Euro 96 semi-final penalty shootout against Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Seaman consoles Gareth Southgate after the defender’s decisive miss in the Euro 96 semi-final penalty shootout against Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The positive is my four-month-old son lying on the floor in front of me won’t grow up with a negative stereotype of women’s football. It will be the norm for him. He probably won’t constantly compare the women’s game to the men’s.</p> <p>And maybe those comparisons are pointless. I sympathise with those who cover the women’s game week-in, week-out having to read articles – like this one – possibly oversimplifying women’s football, or trying to make some grand statement about what every result means.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/england-v-germany-final-will-be-a-football-feast-says-voss-tecklenburg-womens-euro-2022\">England v Germany final will be ‘a football feast’, says Voss-Tecklenburg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But watching football is a constant comparison. Every match we watch we relate to what went before, so for those of us embedded in the men’s game it’s only natural to do the same. If someone hammers it in off the bar, I say “Tony Yeboah” before it’s bounced back up and hit the top of the net.</p> <p>And there are parts of these Euros that feel refreshing – referees getting less abuse, fewer really dangerous challenges, the lack of that “tiny minority” of fans booing the knee, abusing the opposition or singing grim chants about human tragedy. It would be odd to watch this tournament and not notice the differences.</p> <p>As a casual viewer, I may be doing the women’s game a grave disservice. Perhaps Wembley Way on Sunday will be another modern day coked-up Caravaggio: flares, arses, stormed barricades – the lot. And this isn’t to denigrate every part of the men’s game – this isn’t an either/or game. Neither is perfect, they can learn from each other, and they’re both entertaining, which ultimately is the point. Like Messi and Ronaldo, why can’t we just enjoy both?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, our women’s football newsletter.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Above it all, as Ian Wright said so powerfully at the end of the Sweden game, this has to translate into more girls getting the opportunity to play. According to the FA’s latest figures, only 63% of schools offer girls’ football in PE lessons and only 40% of schools offer girls regular extracurricular football.</p> <p>I have friends and colleagues for whom this final feels like the end-point of years of sacrifice, struggle and love for the women’s game. I hope for them more than anything that England can do it. I’m happy to jump on that bandwagon and crucially to stay on it. And if the Germans beat us, at the very least we’ll get one more heartbreaking montage.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Have you seen our Women’s Euro 2022 marketing activity online?

Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan play 19th-century lesbian fossil hunters, which makes you wish French and Saunders were still doing parodies. They dig up a massive dinosaur head on the beach, go home and give each other head. The male director [Francis Lee] said they could direct the scene themselves, and it’s the worst sex scene of all time. So women can definitely get it wrong.<br><br><strong>What are your memories of writing and performing </strong><strong>Benedetta: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy</strong> <em>TopTramp</em></p> <p>I co-wrote it with a writer called Richard Canning, who found this book by Judith C Brown. When parents couldn’t afford to pay the dowries, they’d ship their daughters off to a convent. Our take [a one-woman theatrical show] was very different to Paul Verhoeven’s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/09/benedetta-review-paul-verhoeven-charlotte-rampling\">Benedetta</a>, which was mainly about the sex. We were more interested in this girl who had been sent to a nunnery, age five, and put up with it all until she was about 20. She starts doing ventriloquism, going into a trance and claiming she’s surrounded by angels called Splenditello and Tesauriello Fiorito. Then Jesus turns up and wants to marry her. Eventually, the Pope’s envoy arrives, by which time she’s faking her own stigmata and having a lesbian affair with a younger nun, claiming she’s been embodied by a male angel.</p> <p>I played all 50 nuns, leaping around in a leotard in a basement theatre in Oxford. The stage manager, Stevie Lee – now a successful film producer – made me mime everything. I said: “Can we have real blood?” – meaning: “Can we have stage blood for the stigma bleeding?” So, Stevie went to the local abattoir and got a load of sheep’s blood. I emptied this thing over me, and it stank so much that – and can I put this in the Guardian? – the next time I had a period, I retched.</p> <p><strong>Any future plans to go back and do that PhD on the spaghetti western? </strong><em>Amongmasterswords</em></p> <p>No plans! I was pretty obsessed with Italian cinema, but the spaghetti westerns, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pistol_for_Ringo\">A Pistol for Ringo</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_Ringo\">The Return of Ringo</a>, were glorious. They would make three versions of each film: not too violent for the US, slightly more violent for Europe and incredibly violent for Africa. They ran for about 15 years, then morphed into comedy westerns – fagioli, which means beans – birthing the career of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/06/ennio-morricone-obituary\">Ennio Morricone</a>.</p> <p>The University of Reading had the best Italian cinema department, with a guy called <a href=\"https://romancelanguages.nd.edu/people/faculty/zygmunt-bara-ski/\">Zygmunt Barański</a>. I was interested in studying for a PhD, but, on the train home from the interview, I realised that I wasn’t <em>that</em> interested. I thought: “I’ll be 27 and a world expert in spaghetti westerns. What’s the point of that?” So I ran away to clown school – which didn’t impress my parents.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/02/philippe-gaulier-clown-school-emma-thompson-sacha-baron-cohen-edinburgh-festival-interview\">Philippe Gaulier</a> [founder of the clown school] has taught Emma Thompson, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. He’s the opposite to [Russian theatre practitioner] Konstantin Stanislavski. Rather than building an alternate character in your head, you just play. His thinking was: you’ve got to be enjoying it, else it’s unwatchable. I was 22/23, and thinking I was this great intellectual actor. He spent the whole time saying [in French accent]: “You think you’re so clever? You are <em>so</em> stupid.” I was fantastically upset at the time, but now I see what he means.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c232f1b2f03182d02e9a686c4958e09a1379a79f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c232f1b2f03182d02e9a686c4958e09a1379a79f/0_129_1536_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Allen, Sally Phillips & Doon Mackichan in Smack the Pony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Allen, Sally Phillips &amp; Doon Mackichan in Smack the Pony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Smack the Pony was wonderfully silly. Should there be more silliness in television? </strong><em>Stoatboy</em></p> <p>We have such a strong tradition of surreal comedy – Spike Milligan, the Goons, the Goodies, Monty Python – so I don’t know why it’s so hard to pitch silly. Maybe, it’s because it looks so little on the page. If the script says “an intersectional comedy with a dark seam about gender relations in the role of the refugee”, then it feels more like you’re buying something important than if it says “mucks about with a pair of Spanx and a kettle”.</p> <p><strong>How would <a href=\"https://veep.fandom.com/wiki/Minna_H%C3%A4kkinen\">Minna Häkkinen</a> – the Finnish prime minister you play in Veep – do a better job of running the UK? </strong><em>Fussyandhonest</em></p> <p>Minna has got no boundaries and is very, very honest. She’s the exact opposite of the type we’ve got in. Frankly, my 10-year-old would do a better job because he’s deceitful – “Did you steal those sweets?” “No” – but at least he gives in when challenged: “<em>Did</em> you steal those sweets?” “Yes.”<br><strong><br>Do you feel pressured into taming your curls as most curlies in the public eye? Freedom for curls!</strong> <em>MomDoc</em></p> <p>It’s fine to be curly if you’re a classical musician, but not if you’re an actor. There’s an unspoken rule that women in the same show can’t have the same hair colour. If the lead is blond, the number two has to have brown, red or black hair.

In [2021 comedy drama] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/22/off-the-rails-review-blondie\">Off the Rails</a>, I went dark because everybody else was blond.

I’ve signed a lot of photos of Miranda Hart as well. I don’t think I look like Renée Zellweger, so I’m enormously flattered by that question. If they ever do a fourth Bridget Jones, I’d have to play her mother because, compared to Renée, I’m ageing in dog years.</p> <p><strong>You always look as if you’re </strong><strong>on the verge of laughing. Is that your default look or is there something perpetually amusing going on in your head? </strong><em>slobberfest</em></p> <p>Alan Partridge was definitely faked. I was enormously put out, age 26 or 27, that people thought I was just laughing. I gave myself a headache trying to fake it – you have to really shake your shoulders – because real laughter doesn’t read on camera. But, when I played Gibby, the Swiss au pair in Friday Night Dinner, I was about to cry all the time, so that was the opposite.</p> <p><strong>You’ve done amazing things to highlight how children with </strong><strong>Down’s syndrome</strong><strong> should be included in society.

But our welfare state has collapsed. So things are both brighter – but also much darker: screening can now identify many kinds of difference before birth, not just Down’s syndrome. Although it’s not really the climate to talk about that because of what is happening in the US.</p> <p>I’m a patron of the Skylarks charity in Richmond [south-west London], and we are now meeting lots of needs that were previously met by the state. People with disabilities fared much worse under austerity during the pandemic. So it’s difficult. We know how to look after people; we know how to give people equal opportunity in life; but we’re heading into bleak economic times, and people with disabilities are always the first to suffer. So I don’t know what to say.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/23/sexy-stupid-and-still-spot-on-the-timeless-genius-of-smack-the-pony\">Sexy, stupid and still spot on: the timeless genius of Smack the Pony</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How has your life been changed by your caring responsibilities for your son Olly?

It has knocked off some of my edges – but they were edges that needed to come off. I had a very privileged upbringing.

I went to Oxford, and I’ve worked in comedy, where, you know, you’re allowed to work in comedy if you went to Oxford <em>or</em> Cambridge.

Olly is all about love. I’ve learned to value interdependency over independence and it reminds us all that truthfulness, faithfulness and care are a million times more important than exams such as A-levels. It’s a cliche that those with Down’s syndrome are happy all the time. Olly has all the emotions of my other two children, and there is fighting. But I have such a rich life, and Olly plays a major role.

As a city, Brum is ready to show off its personality and culture, as well as the ability to host a big party (the opening ceremony). If you have overlooked or dismissed the second city before, it is time to think again. Here are 20 reasons to change your mind.</p> <h2>We really love sport</h2> <p>Brummies have a passion for sport. Birmingham City versus Aston Villa is one of the most intense rivalries in the country, but for the most part the fans know where to draw the line. The rivalry is a world away from the religious intolerance of Glasgow or the tired banter of Manchester. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-liew\" title=\"\">Jonathan Liew</a> called it right when he said: “The second city derby is one perhaps best characterised by a glorious, gleeful pettiness.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc3eed65841aea26515e2f39c81b3140263d8b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc3eed65841aea26515e2f39c81b3140263d8b80/332_0_2458_3071/800.jpg\" alt=\"Birmingham City legend Trevor Francis\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birmingham City legend Trevor Francis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sydney O’Meara/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were the first place to have a football phone-in on the radio and, in Villa’s 19th-century chairman William McGregor, were home to one of the founders of the Football League (forcing fans to learn to care about every match, even those wet Wednesdays in Walsall).</p> <p>We also have a claim to have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis\" title=\"\">invented modern tennis</a>. Oh, and the 70s poster of the girl scratching her bum? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/22/athena-tennis-girl-poster-exhibition\" title=\"\">Taken in Brum</a>.</p> <h2>Peaky Blinders</h2> <p>Before Peaky Blinders became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/02/peaky-blinders-mania-birmingham-screen-tourism-boom\" title=\"\">a worldwide phenomenon</a>, Birmingham wasn’t well regarded as a home of TV. We had Pebble Mill at One, the little children’s car Brum and the wobbly sets of Crossroads. ATV, now ITV Central, was based here, but didn’t make many programmes set in the city. Until Cillian Murphy’s cheekbones and razor blades cut through, the people of Birmingham would joke about erecting a statue of Michael Elphick on a motorbike; it would be a huge Boon for the area, they said. Stephen Knight’s period gangster drama has changed all that. It has made Birmingham (along with short back and sides haircuts and flat caps) famous and even – whisper it – trendy.</p> <h2>The No 11 bus</h2> <p>Birmingham doesn’t have the cultural romance of the train or the solidarity of the Underground experience. More than 80% of public transport journeys in the city are by bus, so a shared bus route has become part of our identity. The No 11 outer circle route is the longest bus route in the country and connects almost all of Birmingham’s outer suburbs. We are obsessed with all 26 miles and 280 stops.</p> <p>While Duran Duran claim they wrote Hungry Like the Wolf in EMI’s studios in London, word has it that the true location was the No 11 bus. They can’t have made a full circuit, though – there is no way those lyrics took two and a half hours to write.</p> <h2>Pre-Raphaelites</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71df2e5e1b3d5192519a8e63478d05ea2118cc93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71df2e5e1b3d5192519a8e63478d05ea2118cc93/0_0_3426_5120/669.jpg\" alt=\"Stained glass by Edward Burne-Jones at St Philip’s Cathedral in Birmingham\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stained glass by Edward Burne-Jones at St Philip’s Cathedral.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arcaid Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery has the largest public pre-Raphaelite collection in the world, with more than 2,000 works. Such a romantic style might seem at odds with the image of the city, but Edward Burne-Jones was born in Brum and the city loves him back. St Philip’s Cathedral and St Martin in the Bull Ring both feature stained glass by him.</p> <h2>Tiswas</h2> <p>It is a “Do you remember things?” programme cliche to say that Tiswas, produced by ATV, was a kids’ programme watched by adults, but it is true. Nothing before or since has matched the anarchy and sensory overload in young brains and no children’s programme has felt so much like a programme for grownups. It didn’t need to throw in “jokes for the parents” in the manner of modern cartoons; it just felt like a family experience. When Chris Tarrant and the others tried an adult version, it flopped, which just proves that kids have the best TV.</p> <h2>Musical diversity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"019db2a62749b820f2cba0f92fa367ada43c3517\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/019db2a62749b820f2cba0f92fa367ada43c3517/0_0_3300_2184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ELO circa 1977\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ELO circa 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the early viral period (after email chains of Tommy Cooper jokes and before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/13/not-just-for-drunken-sailors-how-sea-shanties-took-over-tiktok\" title=\"\">TikTok sea shanties</a> on the six o’clock news), there was a “You know you’re a Brummie when …” list going around.

It was: “You don’t think there’s anything odd in your three favourite bands being ELO, UB40 and Black Sabbath.” The people of Birmingham prize loyalty above liking similar kinds of music, giving us an eclectic taste enabled by the dogma that there is no point going anywhere else.</p> <h2>It gave the world a nice cup of tea</h2> <p>The science behind the modern electric kettle – and a decent cuppa – comes from Brum. Arthur Large created an immersed heating element and the boffins at Bullpit &amp; Sons added a cutoff valve. Without Birmingham, whistles would fill the air, the water would never be at the right temperature and every mug would be a bag floating in a tepid mess. Just ask an American.</p> <h2>The call centre</h2> <p>The next time you have an argument with someone from your mobile provider, thank the city of Birmingham. Without it, you would have had to walk into an office to do it.</p> <p>In 1965, the Birmingham Post and Mail installed the GEC PABX 4 automatic call distributor, which made it the earliest example of a call centre in the UK. Birmingham invented hold music, pressing “2” to speak to the billing department, recording calls for training purposes. Very few are based here now, as people don’t like the accent. So, any problems you have today are not our fault.</p> <h2>Spaghetti Junction</h2> <p>The artist Bill Drummond says that “Spaghetti Junction is the entrance to the underworld” – and he is being polite. It is certainly not universally loved by travellers, but it is a serious feat of engineering: the meeting point of two motorways, two rivers, three canals, a train line and any number of A roads.</p> <p>Billions of people have been on Spaghetti Junction since it opened on 24 May 1972. About 200,000 cars travel on it each day, with some of these finding the right exit. Birmingham doesn’t have many nationally known landmarks, so it is loved here as much as it is hated. When it opened, coach operators offered sightseeing tours for 65p.</p> <h2>Comedy genius</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52c3c251d442d0a7979de4eb03be548d435d654e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52c3c251d442d0a7979de4eb03be548d435d654e/0_0_3544_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Standup comedian Shazia Mirza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Standup comedian Shazia Mirza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They laugh when people from Birmingham say they want to become comedians, after first laughing at the way they said it and repeating it back to them in an exaggerated accent. But Brum has a comedy pedigree to match anywhere. Modern giants such as Joe Lycett, the Esther Rantzen of laughs, are standing on the shoulders of Shazia Mirza, Tony Hancock and Sid Field.</p> <p>Charlie Hall was born in Birmingham in 1899 and trained as a carpenter before finding his way to Hollywood. Working as a stagehand, he became friendly with a young Stan Laurel and eventually appeared in more than 40 movies with Laurel and Oliver Hardy. In 1927’s The Battle of the Century, Laurel and Hardy are caught in the middle of a gigantic custard-pie fight. Who throws the first pie? Hall. A Wetherspoons in his home district of Erdington is a fitting tribute.</p> <h2>The Lunar Society</h2> <p>Birmingham lays claim to all sorts of things; it has a bit of an inferiority complex in that way. Shakespeare is the oddest claim: there are many pubs named after him and you will hear from Brummies that some of the bard’s rhymes only work in the accent.</p> <p>For a time, Birmingham was the centre of innovation – and the people responsible were the members of the Lunar Society, including James Watt, whose steam engine was fundamental to the Industrial Revolution. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the society met and collaborated on some of the most important inventions of the age.</p> <h2>Christmas wouldn’t be the same without us</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"34a490afb67b1fa43e7d96b81423bce6232e1cd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34a490afb67b1fa43e7d96b81423bce6232e1cd7/0_0_3473_5187/670.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Wood (playing bagpipes) and his Wizzard bandmates in 1974\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy Wood (playing bagpipes) and his Wizzard bandmates in 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Local bands Slade and Wizzard are mainstays of any British Christmas celebration. Their songs speak to the togetherness people crave in the dark winter months. Yet Birmingham is the place where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/23/winterval-man-who-created-christmas-is-cancelled-myth\" title=\"\">the council was said to have “cancelled Christmas”</a>. That isn’t true, of course; in fact, we helped Christmas become what it is today.</p> <p>Many of our notions of modern Christmas come from Charles Dickens, who toured the country reading A Christmas Carol. It helped turn the feast day into the jolly, family-oriented affair we have today. The first reading was at Birmingham town hall, so Birmingham is Christmas’s Bethlehem – and Roy Wood wants you to remember that every day.</p> <h2>Brutalist architecture</h2> <p>Prince Charles hated the 70s-built Birmingham Central library; he said it looked like a place where books would be burned, not kept. Eventually, he got his way and it was demolished, but Birmingham still has many brilliantly brutiful buildings. The most striking is the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-birmingham-51839007\" title=\"\">New Street signal box</a>, five storeys of concertinaed concrete, which sits in the middle of the redevelopment of the city centre. Thankfully, it is listed.</p> <h2>We prioritise driving safely</h2> <p>Back when Top Gear was a motoring programme and featured Angela Rippon, rather than lads crashing into things, it was made by BBC Birmingham. Birmingham is the home of the sensible driver. It was the first place to paint a white line down the centre of the road, it pioneered one-way streets and, in 1910, the Brummie engineer Oliver Lucas invented the car horn. Get out of our way, we’re coming through, slowly.</p> <h2>The Electric Cinema</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5da489c73e05207869cda5e98f70163184193ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5da489c73e05207869cda5e98f70163184193ba/0_0_4480_6720/667.jpg\" alt=\"The Electric Cinema, Britain’s oldest working picturehouse\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Electric Cinema, Britain’s oldest working picturehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Electric Cinema, just behind New Street station, is the oldest working picturehouse in the country. It opened in 1909 and is still going as an independent concern. This is appropriate, because without Birmingham there would have been no movie industry. Movies are made of film, which is made of celluloid. This was created, as Parkesine, in Brum in 1862 by Alexander Parkes.</p> <h2>Potato scallops</h2> <p>In Birmingham, you buy a scallop that has never seen the sea with your chips. Birmingham scallops are large slices of potato, covered in batter and deep-fried. If you think that more fried potato isn’t the ideal side to a portion of fried potato, you are wrong. Try it.</p> <h2>The Ikon gallery</h2> <p>Birmingham is brimming with good modern art and the Ikon gallery has had a huge influence. In 1965, it took up residence in an octagonal, glass-walled kiosk in Birmingham’s new Bull Ring area, before moving into a renovated building in Brindleyplace. There is lots of good street art and there are many small, interesting art spaces, but always go to the Ikon gallery and check out the singing lift.</p> <h2>It is very green</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8da00a880070622e51b568c1b27bbb72dda1be54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8da00a880070622e51b568c1b27bbb72dda1be54/0_0_4287_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cattle in Sutton Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cattle in Sutton Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Underhill/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a city packing more than 1 million people into a fairly small space, Birmingham is green. Sutton Park, Cannon Hill Park, Highbury Park (home to Highbury Hall, rumoured to be the inspiration for the Cluedo mansion), Aston Park and Handsworth Park are all great open spaces. The private Moseley Park is tucked behind a row of shops and is intensely beautiful. To appreciate just how green the city is, take a few steps outside it and climb a hill; the Lickey Hills will do, as will Barr Beacon. You will feel at one not just with the town, but also the countryside.</p> <h2>Our eternal optimism</h2> <p>Like an obscure Tory backbencher, Birmingham can’t help throwing its hat into the ring for anything going. In 1992, it bid for the Olympics – and within the city there was a real feeling that it might just do it. Without backing from the central government, and with Margaret Thatcher’s anti-sanction stance on South Africa not winning friends internationally, it was no surprise that Barcelona was chosen. Unbowed, Birmingham kept bidding: for the 1996 Olympics (beaten at the first hurdle), for the European Capital of Culture in 2008 (lost to Liverpool), for the UK Capital of Culture in 2013 (Derry won), for Channel 4’s headquarters (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/sep/05/channel-4-opens-new-hq-in-leeds-as-it-fights-against-privatisation\" title=\"\">lost to Leeds</a>).</p> <p>Birmingham’s last day in the sun was in 1998, when we held the G8 summit a few days before hosting the Eurovision song contest. On TV, Terry Wogan’s intro was accompanied by a tracking shot of a well-scrubbed city fading from old canal footage; Wogan complained that he had been forced to vacate his hotel room to make way for Bill Clinton.</p> <p>After almost missing the bidding deadline for the Commonwealth Games, Birmingham is ecstatic – and we have just announced <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/central/2022-07-26/where-the-eurovision-song-contest-2023-could-be-held-in-the-midlands\" title=\"\">we fancy having Eurovision again</a>.</p> <h2>The balti triangle</h2> <p>Every article about Birmingham must mention the balti triangle, between Ladypool Road, Stoney Lane and Stratford Road in south Birmingham. It is so named because this is where so many of the city’s curries disappear. There is a reason everyone mentions it: it is great.</p> <p>Every local you speak to will have a balti house they claim is the best. Part of that won’t be the food, but the atmosphere they create, whether that is by giant, table-sized naan breads (which have gone out of fashion a bit) or the chatter between tables. The balti, mixed together in a pan and absolutely delicious, is a perfect metaphor for Birmingham.</p> <p><em>Birmingham: It’s Not Shit by Jon Bounds, Jon Hickman and Danny Smith is out now </em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/28/republicans-bill-healthcare-military-veterans-jon-stewart","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T12:51:57Z","webTitle":"Anger as Republicans block bill to help military veterans exposed to toxins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/republicans-bill-healthcare-military-veterans-jon-stewart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/republicans-bill-healthcare-military-veterans-jon-stewart","fields":{"headline":"Anger as Republicans block bill to help military veterans exposed to toxins","trailText":"Jon Stewart, who has lobbied for bipartisan bill to expand healthcare for veterans, condemns ‘stab-vets-in-the-back senators’","byline":"Sam Levine in New York","body":"<p>The comedian Jon Stewart ripped into Republican senators on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/senate-burn-pit-bill-fails/index.html\">after they abruptly halted</a> a bipartisan bill that would expand healthcare access for military veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.</p> <p>The former host of the Daily Show, who now hosts The Problem with Jon Stewart on Apple TV+, has lobbied for the bill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/biden-trump-2024-president-election-poll\">Most Americans do not want Biden or Trump in 2024, poll finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1552445098738450432\">called</a> those who switched their votes “stab-vets-in-the-back senators”.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1552428722564775941\">added</a>: “PS: fuck the Republican caucus and their empty promise to our veterans.”</p> <p>The measure, called the <a href=\"https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/releases/us-senate-passes-pact-act-to-support-veterans\">Honoring our Pact Act</a>, would make it easier for veterans to access military care related to exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam and toxins from pits used to burn military waste in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>A version of the bill passed the Senate 84-14 earlier this year but was sent back to the House for some technical corrections.

It’s a question weighing on consumers, politicians and investors around the world. Today we got one step closer to answering it. And the answer is: maybe?</p> <h2>How do we define recession</h2> <p>For many, the unofficial rule of thumb is that a recession has started after two consecutive quarters of economic contraction measured by a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of the price of goods and services. In the first three months of the year GDP contracted at an annual rate of 1.6%.</p> <p>Today the commerce department announced that GDP shrank again by an annual rate of 0.9% in the second quarter.</p> <h2>So that’s it?</h2> <p>Not so fast. Officially, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) – a non-profit group of economists – defines when the US is in a recession.</p> <p>The NBER looks at GDP but also at employment figures, personal income, industrial production and other factors. It defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months”.</p> <p>Federal Reserve and administration officials would also prefer the public not to think of a recession as defined purely by GDP – and presumably not to think about it at all – so they are stressing that the picture is more complicated.</p> <h2>Are they right?</h2> <p>Yes and no. Look at the jobs market. The unemployment rate is 3.6%, near a half-century low. Wages are also rising, although not as quickly as inflation, and 2.7 million people were hired in the first half of the year.</p> <p>But at the same time, consumer confidence has collapsed, inflation is causing real hardship even for those with jobs, the once white-hot housing market is cooling fast in some areas, stock markets are jittery, to say the least. On top of that, you can bet that were the Republicans in power, Democrats would be calling two quarters of GDP decline a recession.</p> <h2>What are politicians and government officials saying?</h2> <p>Fed chairman Jerome Powell and treasury secretary Janet Yellen argued that inflation would be “transitory” far longer than was realistic, and they may do so again, accepting the reality of a recession. They’re both keen to promote the notion that it’s possible to cool the economy without slamming it into reverse – so-called “soft landing”.</p> <p>In many ways, it’s a linguistic balancing act, with broad political consequences. On Wednesday the Fed sharply raised rates again and Powell was repeatedly asked if the US was in, or was heading towards, a recession. Powell said he didn’t believe the US was in recession but – and it’s a big but – he expects the Fed’s rate hikes to slow the economy and the job market to weaken. That’ll sure feel like a recession for some.</p> <h2>How unprecedented is the economic situation?</h2> <p>In a word, extremely. Covid disrupted the global economy in a way we have never experienced. And that disruption – much like Covid – is still with us. We have a 40-year high in high inflation, wars in important commodity-producing regions, declining real wages, slowing economic growth and a Fed that is aggressively tightening money supply after years of low rates. At the same time, the jobs market is good and consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – is OK, for now.</p> <p>Nobel economic laureate and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has called it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/opinion/employment-wages-recession-economy.html\">“the humbug economy”</a> – for him the numbers “don’t add up”. It may take entering a recession to figure out what is going on. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/28/us-economy-gdp-second-quarter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T12:33:45Z","webTitle":"US economy shrinks in second quarter, signaling unofficial start of recession","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/us-economy-gdp-second-quarter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/28/us-economy-gdp-second-quarter","fields":{"headline":"US economy shrinks in second quarter, signaling unofficial start of recession","trailText":"The bad news will be a major blow for the Biden administration as it prepares for a tough midterm election season","byline":"Dominic Rushe","body":"<p>The US economy shrank again in the last three months, unofficially signaling the start of a recession.</p> <p>The commerce department announced Thursday that gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of the price of goods and services – decreased at an annualized rate of 0.9% in the second quarter after falling at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first three months.</p> <p>The bad news will be a major blow for the Biden administration as it prepares for a tough midterm election season. White House officials have tried to tamp down talk of a recession, arguing that many parts of the economy remain strong.</p> <p>The growth rate stands in marked contrast to the robust 6.9% annual increase in GDP recorded in the final quarter of 2021 when the economy roared back from Covid shutdowns.</p> <p>The fast pace of growth contributed to soaring inflation – now running at 40-year highs – and the Federal Reserve’s decision to sharply increase interest rates in order to bring down prices.</p> <p>The changing economic environment was reflected in the GDP report. Consumer spending – the largest driver of the economy – slowed over the quarter but remained positive, rising 1% on an annual basis. Residential fixed investment, or home construction, dropped 14% on an annual basis and slowing business inventories, goods produced but not yet sold by businesses, dragged down the GDP number.</p> <p>Two quarters of negative GDP growth are widely regarded as a signal that the economy has gone into recession. But the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end. While the GDP figures will play into the NBER’s final verdict, it also looks at a wider range of economic factors, including the jobs market, and is unlikely to give its decision soon.</p> <p>“The 0.9% annualized fall in GDP in the second quarter is disappointing but doesn’t mean the economy is in recession,” said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. “That said, the details show that higher rates and surging inflation are weighing on underlying demand, and we expect only a muted rebound in economic growth over the second half of the year.”</p> <p>In the meantime, pressure remains on the Biden administration. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-consumer-confidence-drops-lowest-141905617.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMm7-CnrK3kWaw4TiEjmlTqwCSOK65YfRv92PaCTpa1HsNw98hLM2UxFbH6P-iwJEZ_sDfUNMXbxV3JjnU0JCUsSbgxZwzBKzcmNZLPT_k0Yr1wPi85kOkD5yxeZ5deLs2qkm7nhMisUV34VCXaiRxpK1khCbzOH4wmvgbmkKZNp\">Surveys of consumer confidence </a>are falling as recession fears grow and Joe Biden’s overall and economic approval <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/american-economic-survey/\">poll numbers</a> are at the lowest levels of his presidency.</p> <p>In a statement, Biden said it was “no surprise that the economy is slowing down as the Federal Reserve acts to bring down inflation. But even as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure.”</p> <p>Republicans countered that the report shows “Democrats’ reckless economic policies are destroying our economy”.</p> <p>The latest GDP figures came a day after the Fed announced another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/fed-increase-interest-rates-inflation\">three-quarter of a percentage point</a> increase in its benchmark interest rates as it fights to tame inflation.</p> <p>Prices rose at an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/13/high-us-gas-food-prices-june-led-to-largest-annual-increase-inflation-40-years\">annual rate of 9.1%</a> in the year to June, driven up by soaring costs for fuel, food and shelter.</p> <p>While parts of the US economy remain strong – most notably the jobs market – the Covid pandemic continues to play havoc with global supplies and the war in Ukraine has pushed up energy prices.</p> <p>The confusing economic outlook has triggered sell-offs in stock markets around the world and led some economists to predict a recession is coming. Nearly 70% of leading academic economists <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53fcbbf1-39e3-483c-a6f2-b0de432ed5a3\">polled by the Financial Times</a> last month predicted the US economy will tip into a recession next year.</p> <p>Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that he did not believe the US was now in a recession.

They raise further questions about why attempts to address what has long been acknowledged as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/21/head-drug-deaths-taskforce-scotland-punishment\">public health emergency</a> are making slow progress.</p> <p>Scotland continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe and five times the rate in England. Campaigners denounced a “massive accountability gap” around quality and availability of services.</p> <p>Justina Murray, the chief executive of Scottish Families Affected by Alcohol and Drugs, said anything less than a zero drug deaths target was an “insult”. “We’ve had a raft of reports, policies and strategies that say what needs to change, there’s a lot of agreement, but when you speak to families on the ground they don’t understand what’s getting in the way of good words becoming good deeds.”</p> <p>The figures reveal a number of local spikes in the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, as well as Dumfries and Galloway, while deaths of women increased by 8% to 397 last year. Almost all deaths involve more than one drug and 84% involve opiates such as heroin or codeine.</p> <p>Angela Constance, the Scottish government’s minister for drugs policy, said the number of deaths remained “unacceptable” and that work would continue at pace to address the emergency with £250m invested over the course of this parliament. Her dedicated position was created by Nicola Sturgeon in December 2020 after the first minster said her government had “taken its eye off the ball”.</p> <p>Constance said she was particularly concerned about the rise in deaths among women and “will look to expand on current steps we are taking including the provision of two mother and child residential recovery houses”.</p> <p>Opposition leaders said the Scottish National party government had to accept a large share of the blame: it had been in government for 15 years and previously cut funding for drugs services.</p> <p>Last week, Scotland’s drugs deaths taskforce published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/21/head-drug-deaths-taskforce-scotland-punishment\">hard-hitting report</a> condemning “woefully inadequate” underfunding of services. It also suggested a revised timescale of two years for introducing new medically assisted treatment standards, which guarantee same-day treatment and a choice of treatment for addicts. Most recent estimates suggest fewer than 50% of those with a drug problem are accessing treatment.</p> <p>The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, said the figures were “a badge of shame for Nicola Sturgeon, who has presided over a huge escalation in Scotland’s drug-deaths epidemic during her time in office”.</p> <p>He called on the Scottish government to support his party’s right to recovery bill, which would enshrine in law the right of everyone with an addiction problem to access the treatment they need. The bill goes before the Scottish parliament later this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Liddell, the chief executive of Scottish Drugs Forum, said the figures represented “an ongoing systemic failure in prevention”. While scrutiny of the treatment system was welcome, he added that these services represented “the sharp end” of provision. “We need to look at the capacity of treatment services in terms of the workforce. Too many of these essential workers are suffering the burnout that is common in working in under-resourced systems with very vulnerable people experiencing poverty”.</p> <p>Scottish Labour’s Paul Sweeney, who has launched his own members’ bill to establish overdose prevention centres – where addicts can take drugs with support and supervision – cautioned against celebrating the slight decrease in this year’s figures: “1,330 of our fellow Scots have died entirely preventable deaths … The solutions are no secret. We need action, not reports with recommendations that are never implemented.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/28/germany-bremen-shut-all-betting-shops-money-laundering-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T12:03:23Z","webTitle":"German city to shut all betting shops amid money-laundering allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/germany-bremen-shut-all-betting-shops-money-laundering-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/28/germany-bremen-shut-all-betting-shops-money-laundering-allegations","fields":{"headline":"German city to shut all betting shops amid money-laundering allegations","trailText":"Shops have a week to appeal after failing to convince Bremen officials they are not fronts for crime","byline":"Philip Oltermann in Hamburg","body":"<p>The northern German city of Bremen is planning to shut down all of its betting shops after the interior senator said their owners had failed to convince him that they were not fronts for money laundering.</p> <p>Bremen, Germany’s smallest city-state, announced on Wednesday it had issued rejection notices to 32 establishments that had applied for betting licences under a new gambling law, meaning any bets placed on their premises would with immediate effect be deemed illegal.</p> <p>The betting shops have until 5 August to legally challenge the decision or supply the senate with paperwork showing how they obtained their startup capital to open their businesses in the first place, such as a loan agreement with a bank.</p> <p>Bremen authorities say they are tackling a problem that is not unique to their city but widespread across Germany.

Unlike his Tory counterparts, he has spent years working on the climate crisis and believes climate-conscious Conservative voters do not feel respected and feel ignored by the party’s leadership. He hopes the Climate party will provide them with an alternative that will protect the economy, people and the climate.</p> <p>“We’ve got one election left to save the planet,” he said.</p> <p>The Climate party plans to challenge the Conservatives in 110 marginal seats in the next election where the Conservatives are only winning by up to 7,000 votes.</p> <p>Gemmell said his party would also target the 19 Tory MPs who are members of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/tory-faction-net-zero-brexit-green-policies\">Net Zero Scrutiny Group</a>, a collection of Conservative backbenchers who opposed the government’s net zero policies. “The Craig Mackinlays, the Steve Bakers – we’ll stand against them in every single place. Any Conservative that tries to join that group and destroy the future of my kids, and lose us this big opportunity, we will put a centre-right candidate against them.”</p> <p>The Tories may well be spooked. Gemmell beat Conservative rivals to become a councillor in Buckinghamshire in May 2019, elected as an independent candidate with a single policy, “climate action now”. He went on to become a councillor for Hazlemere last year, and is the managing director of <a href=\"https://www.scientistswarningeurope.org.uk/\">Scientists Warning Europe</a>, a charity that promotes “science-endorsed solutions” for the energy transition.</p> <p>The recent Australian general election may also provide a cautionary tale.

Gemmell’s vision is for the UK to become a global leader in the energy transition by stopping all subsidies for fossil fuel companies, implementing polluter-pays policies to stimulate the circular economy, and investing in renewable infrastructures and technologies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2022/jul/28/which-tory-leadership-candidate-is-greenest-podcast\">Which Tory leadership candidate is the ‘greenest’? – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather than allowing the left a monopoly on such policies, Gemmell says these are smart, pro-business ideas that will give the UK economy a competitive advantage as the whole world increasingly turns its attention to decarbonising and the energy transition. He says the policies are not nearly as radical as the Tory government would have voters believe, claiming one-third of British councils are already committed to carbon zero by 2030.</p> <p>Gemmell said: “It’s not a big policy for government because it’s already happening”, adding that the climate pledges at the heart of Conservative policy were harmful and revealed the party’s unfocused

party is still building the rest of its manifesto, but he said many Conservative voters were desperate for a party that reflected their deep concerns about climate breakdown, even if that party did not have all the answers.</p> <p>“The whole point is to bring the focus in of all of the great minds in Britain, the focus of the finance sector in driving that, to get to the point where we can answer those questions,” said Gemmell. “Until we start on that path with a war-like effort, we aren’t going to make it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/28/frasers-snaps-up-i-saw-it-first-as-it-builds-online-fashion-portfolio","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T11:30:42Z","webTitle":"Frasers

June – from £2.5bn a year earlier to £1.5bn – falling short of the analysts’ consensus forecast of £1.6bn.</p> <p>The lender was knocked by a jump in conduct costs, which increased from £143m a year earlier to £1.3bn, after it was forced to start the process of buying back US securities it had not been authorised to sell. Some of that money has been put aside to deal with the potential fine expected to be levied by US regulators over the error.</p> <p>Barclays’ chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, announced on Thursday he had commissioned an external review of the trading blunder that would be handed to the board shortly.</p> <p>“We will consider all these findings carefully and take appropriate action in response,” he said, adding that the bank “continued to engage positively” with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is likely to issue the financial penalty.</p> <p>The bank also took a £200m charge to cover potential defaults in the second quarter, though the bulk of the charge related to its decision to buy up the credit card business of the US clothing retailer Gap.</p> <p>Barclays put no extra money aside to cushion the blow of potential defaults in the UK, but said it was taking surging inflation, and its effect on borrowers facing higher bills, into account. </p> <p>It came after the price of essentials including food and fuel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-inflation-rise-petrol-diesel-prices\">pushed UK inflation to a 40-year high of 9.4% in June</a>.</p> <p>Barclays said it expected impairment charges linked to potential defaults to remain below pre-pandemic levels, partly due to high repayment rates on unsecured products such as credit cards, more prudent spending by customers and savings built up during the pandemic.</p> <p>The bank’s chief financial officer, Anna Cross, said Barclays was keeping an eye for “tiny changes in behaviour” including whether customers were starting to rely on their overdrafts or using their credit cards to withdraw cash.</p> <p>“We are not seeing any significant change behaviour at all,” Cross said on Thursday. “I think it’s because of the the rational change around their own spending patterns. But also what we saw during Covid was a real build up of savings by consumers and indeed corporates, and the [subsequent] paydown in unsecured debt.”</p> <p>“They’re going into this environment in really much better financial shape than they would have been pre-pandemic,” she added.</p> <p>The lender also reported a 31% slump in investment banking fees to £1.2m in the first half of the year, reflecting a slowdown in deals and takeover activity by businesses that have been concerned about the weaker economic outlook.</p> <p>Barclays said it was expecting average UK GDP growth of 3.9% this year, falling to 1.7% in 2023. “There certainly there is pressure on the economy … we think therefore that growth will reduce,” Venkatakrishnan said. “Whether it’s an actual recession or not, it’s difficult to say at this moment.”</p> <p>The chief executive added that the bank was also poised for a further rise in interest rates to 2.5% by the end of the year, which could further bolster its net interest margin – a key measure of profitability that accounts for the difference between what it earns from loans and pays for deposits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email \">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barclays has benefited from months of UK interest rate rises that have meant it is able to charge borrowers more for loans and mortgages.

And then money just dried up during Covid,” she said.</p> <p>By Christmas 2020, there was “just £40 left in the accounts”. Amid “real concern for the survival of the organisation”, Davey and the trustees decided “we had to do things differently, we needed to reimagine what the organisation was for, and we had to open our doors”. The rebrand had been “incredibly successful”.</p> <p>But, she added, there was “a group [of members] who do not want change” and were clinging to a “golden age” that was no longer relevant. “Institutions can become a bit archaic. The world is a very different place today.”</p> <p>The new Seven Dials Playhouse, a receiving house that hosts productions for up to six weeks with accompanying workshops, opened in February with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/16/steve-review-seven-dials-playhouse-london\">Steve, a play with a central LGBT+ theme</a>.</p> <p>Kate Maravan, a key figure in Actor in the Centre, said there had been a woeful lack of transparency and consultation over the changes, which were a blow to young actors struggling to establish their careers or in precarious employment.</p> <p>“It’s easy to think of all actors as ‘luvvies’, but a large percentage are regularly unemployed, facing financial difficulties, often very isolated and suffering from mental health issues,” she said.</p> <p>“The Actors Centre was a place where people could learn, collaborate and experiment, a place for cross-pollination and support. It was a community in the heart of London.”</p> <p>Classes included sight reading, voice technique and working on camera, and rehearsal spaces were available to members. Now, said Maravan, although the Seven Dials Playhouse was running ad hoc workshops alongside its productions, they were one-off creative events aimed at a broader clientele, rather than ongoing bread-and-butter skills training for actors.</p> <p>The centre was accessible and affordable, and had initiated a number of projects addressing diversity, she said. “The idea that we’re a group of white, older middle-class people stuck in a nostalgic past, harking back to the good old days is really not true, and it was never the case.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Louise Bangay, another member of the campaign, said the group was keen to discuss with Davey “a way back in that works with the theatre she is running, and to see if we can negotiate our space back as an actors’ centre as it was originally intended in 1978”.</p> <p>Paul Fleming, Equity’s general secretary, said: “Equity believes strongly in the provision of a space and accessible training for actors and other creative professionals in the centre of London.

In the 2000s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/mar/16/television.broadcasting?CMP=gu_com\">First Love, Second Chance</a> aired, giving old flames the chance to decide on whether to make a go of a relationship after spending a week exploring each other’s world.</p> <p>But it was Ex on the Beach, which launched in 2014, that led the genre’s renaissance. Eight singles are sent to enjoy a holiday in the sunshine, then their exes emerge from the sea like sexy krakens. Over the years, the programme has become its own multiverse, with various spin-offs and versions in 15 countries. It has effectively kept most of the Geordie Shore and Towie casts employed for the best part of a decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0477294b805c6656c7a616c0c12a7a918121734c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0477294b805c6656c7a616c0c12a7a918121734c/0_0_1921_913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle and Ibrahim on Eating With My Ex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danielle and Ibrahim on Eating With My Ex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screengrab/BBC/Thames TV/EWME/Dan Russell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there is 2017’s celeb-packed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/31/eating-with-my-ex-review-horribly-moreish-first-dates-style-reunions\">Eating With My Ex</a>, which is now in its fourth season of reuniting former couples over a three-course meal – and the dramatic confrontations, revelations and (sometimes) heartwarming reunions that come with it. Celebrity Ex in the City, part of the Ex on the Beach brand, is a similar format – a group of 12 celebrities debate getting back with their exes over dinner – while Channel 5’s One Night With My Ex unites former couples for 24 hours. </p> <p>So why is reality TV obsessed with the ex? With all these shows, the backstory and the stakes are built in. Often, you’ll find yourself rooting for even the most ill-fated couplings, although sometimes it’s not clear if the participants are in it to reconcile or to get their revenge.</p> <p>Love Island’s producers know this and regularly deploy exes, with Gemma Owen’s ex-boyfriend Jacques O’Neill being brought into the villa this year to shake up the group’s dynamics. As well as the drama surrounding their new partners, their past relationship continued to create tension (such as when Gemma referred to her new partner, Luca, by her ex’s name, or when Jacques had his heart rate raised by Gemma’s striptease during the infamous “heart rate challenge” – leading to him being pressed by his new partner, Paige, and confessing that it was due to having “sex flashbacks”). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/30/ekin-su-culculoglu-all-hail-the-machiavellian-man-eater-love-island\">All hail the Machiavellian man-eater! The Love Island character that guarantees dynamite TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Drama aside, though, some of the most enjoyable scenes occur when two people find their way back to each other. In the Australian reality show Back With the Ex, one pair hadn’t seen each other for 28 years. After having kids (now grown up) and divorcing their partners, Peter and Diane reconnected on the show; watching their relationship pick up where they left off gave the same giddy thrill as reading a second-chance romance novel. Its magic lay in something that viewers of reality TV dating shows are always hungry for, but increasingly miss out on: realness. At a time when going on reality TV to forge fake connections and front “showmances” is common, the raw emotions on these programmes is a welcome breath of fresh air.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/jul/28/sister-act-review-beverley-knight-and-jennifer-saunders-bring-the-laughs-as-rebel-nuns","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T11:12:17Z","webTitle":"Sister Act review – Beverley Knight and Jennifer Saunders bring the laughs as rebel nuns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/28/sister-act-review-beverley-knight-and-jennifer-saunders-bring-the-laughs-as-rebel-nuns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jul/28/sister-act-review-beverley-knight-and-jennifer-saunders-bring-the-laughs-as-rebel-nuns","fields":{"headline":"Sister Act review – Beverley Knight and Jennifer Saunders bring the laughs as rebel nuns","trailText":"Knight and Saunders are full-throated and bristling in the hit musical-from-a-film, with a sprawling cast and hip flasks aplenty","byline":"Ryan Gilbey","body":"<p>The plot of the 1992 comedy Sister Act – a smash for Whoopi Goldberg after Bette Midler turned it down – could be scratched on a sacramental wafer. Having witnessed a murder, the brassy, small-time singer Deloris Van Cartier hides out in a convent where she transforms the nuns’ lives with music. Over-extended for the stage, the show contains few of the miracles required to feed the multitudes, though pluses include the colourful late-1970s, south Philadelphia setting and a cast headed by a full-throated, comically twitchy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/09/beverley-knight-priti-patel-grieves-me\">Beverley Knight</a> (stepping in for Goldberg, who was set to reprise her screen role before the pandemic struck).</p> <p>Jennifer Saunders is the main draw, bridling and bristling as Mother Superior. To the sinful Deloris’s enquiry about whether the convent has a smoking section, she responds with prim, evangelical certainty: “Yes, my dear, and you’re heading for it.” There is nothing funnier here than the moment when Saunders, slumped in her chair as she anticipates the latest bout of choral caterwauling, is startled by the sisters’ new-found tunefulness. Eyes darting frantically around the room to locate the origin of these heavenly harmonies, she yanks open the fabric of her coif to give her ears a better shot at hearing.</p> <p>The director Bill Buckhurst, who famously staged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/29/sweeney-todd-review-harringtons-pie-and-mash-shop-shaftesbury-avenue\">Sweeney Todd</a> in a real pie shop, marshals a sprawling cast which includes Lizzie Bea as Sister Mary Robert, singing hungrily of the pleasures denied to her, such as surfing and skinny-dipping. Indeed, it’s one of the show’s quirks that few of the nuns seem suited to a life of austerity; even Mother Superior swigs from a hip flask.</p> <p>Inspiration flags before a finale in which Morgan Large’s mock stained-glass set glows rainbow-coloured, but good humour sees it through. One exception is the big femicide number crooned by Deloris’s pursuer Curtis (Jeremy Secomb) as he and his soulful backing singers debate whether to stab, shoot or drown their quarry, or to “give her skull a big dent / With a blunt instrument.” This is one occasion when the composers Alan Menken (music) and Glenn Slater (lyrics) should have taken a vow of silence.</p> <p>• At <a href=\"https://www.eventimapollo.com/events/detail/sister-act-the-musical\">Eventim Apollo, London</a>, until 28 August.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/28/number-uk-non-doms-down-pandemic-travel-curbs","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T11:10:08Z","webTitle":"Number of UK non-doms down by 11% after pandemic travel curbs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/number-uk-non-doms-down-pandemic-travel-curbs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/28/number-uk-non-doms-down-pandemic-travel-curbs","fields":{"headline":"Number of UK non-doms down by 11% after pandemic travel curbs","trailText":"HMRC says drop for 2020-21 financial year coincided with ‘substantial reduction in international aviation’","byline":"Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent","body":"<p>The number of super-rich people who live in the UK but pay no tax on their offshore income has fallen by 11%, after the pandemic imposed severe travel restrictions, according to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-non-domiciled-taxpayers-in-the-uk/statistical-commentary-on-non-domiciled-taxpayers-in-the-uk--2\">figures published by HMRC</a> on Thursday.</p> <p>UK-based people with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/what-is-non-domicile-status-and-who-qualifies-hmrc\">non-domicile tax status</a> – so called “non-doms” – in the 2020-21 financial year totalled 68,300, a fall of 8,200 on the previous year. The number has been on a downward path since 2017, with tax experts also citing Brexit and tighter government controls on who can claim the tax break.</p> <p>Controversy over non-dom status exploded from being a niche issue among tax experts to wide public debate this year after it was revealed that the wife of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/rishi-sunak-akshata-murty-us-green-cards\">prime ministerial candidate Rishi Sunak</a> was using the status to avoid an estimated £4.5m in tax on dividends she collected from her billionaire father’s IT business.</p> <p>Following widespread outrage, Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/rishi-sunak-akshata-murty-us-green-cards\">said she would pay UK taxes</a> on all income going forward as her tax arrangements were not “compatible with my husband’s [then] job as chancellor”, adding that she appreciated the “British sense of fairness”.</p> <p>However, Murty has retained her non-dom status, which could in the future allow her family to legally avoid an inheritance tax bill of more than £275m.</p> <p>HMRC pointed to Britain’s isolation during successive lockdowns as a reason for the fall in non-doms. “We see that the primary driver of this is fewer new non-domiciled taxpayers coming to the UK to replace those who normally leave,” it said. “This is coincident with the travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that led to a substantial reduction in international aviation, sea and rail travel options to the UK.”</p> <p>Despite the fall in the number of non-doms, the amount collected from them in UK taxes and national insurance stayed roughly flat at £7.9bn. In the 2016-17 tax year they collectively paid £9.5bn in tax.</p> <p>HMRC said the fall in numbers was also driven by residents choosing to change their status to be UK-domiciled after the government introduced an annual “non-dom levy” of between £30,000 and £60,000. The levy, as of April 2017, allows non-doms to continue to pay no tax on offshore income and capital gains unless they bring the money to the UK.</p> <p>“Following a change in policy in April 2017 to remove permanent non-domiciled status, we estimate that there are at least 10,100 individuals claiming deemed domiciled taxpayer status in the UK on their [self-assessment] tax returns in the tax year ending 2021,” HMRC said. “These are individuals that were formerly treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes prior to the 2017 policy.”</p> <p>However, there were almost 100,000 non-doms in 2016, which suggests that 20,000 people have chosen to leave the UK and take their millions or billions to a different tax jurisdiction. Tax experts said the drop in non-doms also reflected the growing number of wealthy people leaving the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/08/britons-non-domicile-status-drops-record-low-brexit-wealth-tax\">because of Brexit</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/non-domtaxpayersintheukchart/giv-6562akpxZYp1y3tb\" data-alt=\"Non-doms chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/non-domtaxpayersintheukchart/giv-6562akpxZYp1y3tb\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The vast majority of non-doms are foreign people living in the UK who use the status to be only taxed on income and capital gains arising in the UK, but not on income and gains generated overseas.

What do we all need? How do you finish a series that’s been embedded in our culture for 37 years? How do you bring all those strands together – past and present storylines; past and present stars – into a finale that captures its impact on those who love it <em>and</em> on those who love saying, “I didn’t even know it was still on?”</p> <p>Let’s find out.</p> <p>In the first scene, Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) wanders the street. Her disbelief is clear – how could this happen? The street is disbanding. Every house except her own has a “FOR SALE” sign up. We seem to have already broken the fourth wall – these look like Woodburne’s real tears. The line between the characters and the people who play them blurs.</p> <p>Neighbours stitched itself into the tapestry of our lives. I watched on an ugly green couch in our rumpus room, mostly dropping whatever I was doing to make sure I was in front of the box at 6.30pm. Like many geriatric millennials, I ripped posters of Brooke Satchwell (Anne) and Dan Parish (Drew) from TV Hits, had strong opinions about whether Carmella was a convincing nun, and used the word “hufter” in everyday conversation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89a6ae85a10b4ae7ccdc33786cb627419bc54024\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89a6ae85a10b4ae7ccdc33786cb627419bc54024/0_0_963_1263/762.jpg\" alt=\"Drew (Dan Parish), Tess (Krista Vendy), Drew (Dan Parish), Flick (Holly Valance) and Joel (Daniel MacPherson) in a Neighbours promo photo from the 90s\" width=\"762\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yes, we were all this hot in the 90s: Drew (Dan Parish), Tess (Krista Vendy), Drew (Dan Parish), Flick (Holly Valance) and Joel (Daniel MacPherson).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Network Ten</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We’re not the only audience, though. Neighbours has found a younger fanbase in recent years, including devotees of #Chelly (the romance between newcomers Elly and Chloe), Mackenzie and Hendrix, and Kyle and Roxy.</p> <p>It’s has also been justifiably criticised – by commentators and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/14/neighbours-more-actors-come-forward-with-allegations-of-racist-slurs-and-discrimination-on-set\">the actors themselves</a> – for its poor treatment and representation of marginalised groups, including people of colour and the queer community. The casting and story choices in the final episode are an effort to rectify this – but one wonders what a show so significant could have achieved by prioritising a more representative neighbourhood, and telling other stories? It is, of course, too late to find out now.</p> <p>Back on the street, Toadie is marrying a woman dressed as an Elvis impersonator, Melanie, played by Lucinda Cowden. Cowden started on the show back in 1987, and she’s one of a number of former stars to have rejoined the main cast in recent years, alongside Annie Jones (Jane Harris), Geoff Paine (Clive Gibbons) and Melissa Bell (Lucy Robinson).</p> <p>In some ways, it’s a jarring split between “oldies who’ve been here the whole time”, “oldies who used to be here and are now here again”, and “young people I don’t really know”. The final episodes have been the Neighbours equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/09/and-just-like-that-review-sex-and-the-city-reboot-has-a-mouthful-of-teething-troubles\">And Just Like That</a><em>, </em>in which the nostalgia factor plays out separately, a nod and a wink to the audience that’s distinct from the storyline.

This time, when Susan once again wanders the bitumen, she’s smiling. She gazes fondly at everyone who’s gathered to celebrate Toadie’s wedding. They have all, independently, decided not to leave Ramsay Street – this has always been where they belong. There is a feeling of calm and community. Nothing has exploded except my own face, with tears.

This attention, and affection, was visibly reciprocated in The Railway Children (1970), widely regarded as the best children’s movie made in Britain, when he played Albert Perks, the kindly old station porter on the platform where Bobbie (Jenny Agutter) and her siblings hope to be reunited with their father one day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b76480155d57aa325526a2e925e322cfca0fcad4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b76480155d57aa325526a2e925e322cfca0fcad4/0_7_3475_2086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Cribbins as Perks the station porter, second from right, with, from left, Sally Thomsett, Gary Warren and Jenny Agutter in The Railway Children, 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernard Cribbins as Perks the station porter, with, from left, Sally Thomsett, Gary Warren and Jenny Agutter in The Railway Children, 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EMI\\StudioCanal/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also had a special relationship with Doctor Who fans, who relished his appearance in the second feature film, Daleks – Invasion Earth 2150 (1966), with Peter Cushing landing the Tardis in a London laid waste by the deadly robots – and then his reincarnation as the wide-eyed amateur astronomer Wilfred Mott, grandfather to Catherine Tate’s Donna Noble, in the David Tennant Doctor Who years, 2007-10.</p> <p>His range was such that it included vaudevillian appearances on the BBC’s long-running music hall showcase, The Good Old Days; knockabout comedy in two gangland capers with Peter Sellers, Two Way Stretch (1960) and The Wrong Arm of the Law (1963); West End farce – he played leading roles opposite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/12/donald-sinden\" title=\"\">Donald Sinden</a>, then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/feb/18/richard-briers\" title=\"\">Richard Briers</a>, in two of Ray Cooney’s signature smash hits, Not Now, Darling (1968) and Run For Your Wife (1983); and revues and musicals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34fe19a00ec6d32ac645ff0b4d42cb3c3c16229e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34fe19a00ec6d32ac645ff0b4d42cb3c3c16229e/0_130_3776_2266/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Cribbins, left, with Peter Cushing and Kenneth Watson in the 1966 Doctor Who film Daleks – Invasion Earth 2150.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernard Cribbins, left, with Peter Cushing and Kenneth Watson in the 1966 Doctor Who film Daleks – Invasion Earth 2150.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cribbins even found success in the pop charts, thanks to the producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/09/george-martin-obituary\" title=\"\">George Martin</a> (before he took up with the Beatles) in 1962, singing two Top 10 novelty songs written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/05/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Myles Rudge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/03/ted-dicks\" title=\"\">Ted Dicks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yShvgXZQBTs\" title=\"\">The Hole in the Ground</a>, which Noël Coward claimed as the record he would save from the waves on Desert Island Discs, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5XX9LX2es4\" title=\"\">Right Said Fred</a>, both of them comic narratives of the class war.

During the depression years in Oldham, Lancashire, there was little work for either of his parents, John Cribbins, a plumber’s mate, and Ethel (nee Clarkson), a corduroy weaver, and so young Bernard leapt at the offer of 15 shillings (75p) a week at the Oldham Coliseum in 1943. The theatre’s director, Douglas Emery, had spotted his talent in an amateur show on that stage. Cribbins was only 14 when he left St Anne’s elementary school to take up the offer of small parts and stage management. He stayed in the job for seven years, playing increasingly larger, then leading, roles, with an interruption in 1947 to complete his national service with the Parachute Regiment in Aldershot, Hampshire, and then in Palestine.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5XX9LX2es4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r5XX9LX2es4?start=23&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=23\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Right Said Fred, a chart hit for Bernard Cribbins in 1962.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 1949 he left to play in seasons at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, with the Piccolo Players; in Chorlton-cum-Hardy in Manchester; and at the new Queen’s theatre in Hornchurch, Essex. The last of these engagements led to his West End debut in 1956 in a musical version of The Comedy of Errors at the Arts theatre. The music was written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Julian Slade</a>, who was instrumental in Cribbins joining his hit musical Salad Days at the Vaudeville in 1956; the cast also included Rudge, who would become a key colleague in Cribbins’s television and stage revue work. The previous year Cribbins had married Gillian McBarnet, his assistant stage manager at Oldham.</p> <p>He divided his time in the 1960s between stage and screen. His first film was Tommy the Toreador (1959) starring Tommy Steele as a seaman turned bullfighter, and the Sellers collaborations led to a double whammy in 1964 of Carry On Jack (he played the lead role of Midshipman Albert Poop-Decker) and Carry On Spying (as one of four hopeless undercover agents led by Barbara Windsor as Daphne Honeybutt). On stage, his comedy credits included New Cranks (1960), a musical revue by the innovative choreographer John Cranko at the Lyric Hammersmith and a more traditional sketch and song revue, And Another Thing (1962), at the Fortune, written by Rudge and Dicks, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/04/anna-quayle-obituary\" title=\"\">Anna Quayle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/05/lionel-blair-obituary\" title=\"\">Lionel Blair</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juCwxT9NjGI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/juCwxT9NjGI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bernard Cribbins voiced all the furry creatures in the BBC children’s TV show The Wombles</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Cooney farce roles cemented Cribbins’s top-of-the-bill standing. In 1969, ITV gave him two series of his own comedy show, Cribbins, and a decade of high-profile television work culminated in Shillingbury Tales by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/24/francis-essex-obituary-television-executive\" title=\"\">Francis Essex</a>, six hour-long episodes of everyday life in a fictional village, filmed on location in Aldbury, Hertfordshire. His character of Cuffy, the colourful tinker, was so successful that it earned him a 1983 spin-off series, Cuffy, in which he was joined by Linda Hayden and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/19/1\" title=\"\">Jack Douglas</a> from the original Shillingbury cast. In High and Dry (1987), he played another penniless eccentric, Ron Archer, who somehow acquires a decrepit pier on the Yorkshire coast just after the war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"532e28fc9c5e7daf39843d65d45246530a22095e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/532e28fc9c5e7daf39843d65d45246530a22095e/0_0_3639_5053/720.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Cribbins as Professor Otto Marvuglia and Alison Fiske as Zaira in La Grande Magia at the National Theatre, 1995.\" width=\"720\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernard Cribbins as Professor Otto Marvuglia and Alison Fiske as Zaira in La Grande Magia at the National Theatre, 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A BBC Play of the Month in 1977 – William Wycherley’s sexually explicit Restoration masterpiece The Country Wife – in which he played the irascible husband of Helen Mirren’s lubricious Margery Pinchwife – was a reminder that he had been away from the stage for too long. After Run for Your Wife, Richard Eyre cast him as Nathan Detroit, succeeding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/30/bob-hoskins\" title=\"\">Bob Hoskins</a>, in his glorious National Theatre production of Guys and Dolls and, 10 years later, put him at the centre of his exquisite 1995 production of La Grande Magia by Eduardo De Filippo, also at the National. Cribbins played a magical mountebank who spirited away the wife of an electrified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/19/alan-howard\" title=\"\">Alan Howard</a> to her lover; the performance, said Michael Billington, was a revelation, combining the grizzled authority of a magus with clear hints of Cribbins’s experience at the tattier end of the showbiz spectrum.</p> <p>As if to prove that he left no television stone unturned, he cropped up in Worzel Gummidge with Jon Pertwee, Last of the Summer Wine with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/05/peter-sallis-obituary\" title=\"\">Peter Sallis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/13/vikramdodd\" title=\"\">Bill Owen</a> and, in 2003, Coronation Street, in which he played Wally Bannister, a lecherous gardener passing himself off as a wealthy haulage firm owner. His later films included Carry On Columbus (1992), the last in the Carry On series; a celebrity cameo spot in the film version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/14/run-for-your-wife-review\" title=\"\">Run For Your Wife</a> (2012); and Mandie Fletcher’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/01/patrick-review-dogs-dinnner-comedy-pug\" title=\"\">Patrick</a> (2018) co-starring Jennifer Saunders, Gemma Jones and Ed Skrein.</p> <p>Cribbins and his wife, Gill, lived in Weybridge, Surrey.

Three things that will mark the end of the pandemic","trailText":"History tells us the end of a deadly outbreak isn’t just about medical data – it’s about political and social changes too, says historian Erica Charters","byline":"Erica Charters","body":"<p>More than two years after the World Health Organization declared the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020\">Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic</a> and more than 18 months after <a href=\"https://covid19.who.int/\">Covid-19 vaccinations</a> were first widely administered, it can still seem there is little consensus on what stage of the epidemic we are now at. Is the epidemic over, with British restrictions lifted a year ago and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/21/airlines-could-be-fined-over-harmful-practices-fuelling-uk-airport-chaos\">airline travel surging</a>? Or do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/19/how-living-with-covid-is-helping-keep-englands-infections-stubbornly-high\">soaring case rates</a> and continued individual health measures suggest the epidemic is nowhere near its end?</p> <p>The trouble is that epidemics do not have the sort of neat, objective endings we may imagine. A swift and decisive endpoint, achieved through the speedy application of scientific innovation – a magic bullet treatment – is usually wishful thinking. It is unlikely we will see anything like that with Covid-19.</p> <p>Analysing past epidemics shows us that actual endings are long, drawn-out and contested. Societies must grapple not just with the medical realities of the disease, harms and treatments, but the political and economic fallout from emergency measures, and disputes over who has the authority to declare an end and what should be measured to guide this process. This is why there is so much uncertainty about the current state of Covid-19: different groups have vastly different experiences of the medical, political and social aspects of the epidemic, and different ideas of what an ending may look like.</p> <p>Research demonstrates that the end of an epidemic involves more than disease rates (the medical end). Instead, the end also encompasses the end of the crisis and regulations (the political end), and the return to normalcy (the social end). These endings are related, but they are different – and they can be at odds with one another. Analysing a variety of past epidemics reveals that it is more accurate to identify <a href=\"https://epidemics.web.ox.ac.uk/home\">multiple endings to an epidemic</a>, taking these different sorts of endpoints into account.</p> <p>The history of recent epidemics such as H1N1 (swine flu) or HIV/Aids bears this out. Most epidemics end not with the disappearance of disease, but when case rates no longer result in a medical crisis – a point in which rates reach what is defined as normal, expected, or locally acceptable levels. In August 2010, for example, the WHO declared that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was in its “<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/10-08-2010-h1n1-in-post-pandemic-period\">post-pandemic period</a>”. This did not mark the end of H1N1 cases; instead, the WHO explained that cases and outbreaks were still expected to occur, but following normal seasonal patterns of influenza. This raises the question of what is a normal, acceptable or manageable level in a given place – particularly for a new disease. Differences of opinion over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/27/absolutely-ridiculous-experts-condemn-victorias-scaling-back-of-covid-pcr-testing\">responses to Covid-19 disease rates</a> – whether to maintain or reinstate public health measures, and when to relax them – demonstrate debates as to what is an acceptable level of infection, as well as who should decide this.</p> <p>As a result, the end process is when different forms of authority negotiate and compete with one another, often debating fundamental social, economic and political priorities as much as medical data. Even in the face of persistent circulation of a disease (whether H1N1 or Covid-19), events such as <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1117702\">war and political instability</a> can redirect public alarm and political resources to other crises, changing what local authorities and local communities deem “normal, expected, or locally acceptable” levels of disease. Concerns about the war in Ukraine or soaring energy prices pushed Covid-19 reporting to the background, regardless of case rates.</p> <p>For example, while the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids\">HIV/Aids pandemic</a> has faded from public attention, cases have not disappeared. Instead, medical treatment has transformed the disease from a highly publicised killer into a manageable, chronic condition. Yet access to such treatment varies, often remaining out of reach for many in the so-called global south. In fact, the success of medical interventions has ended the HIV/Aids epidemic in the global north, in many ways pushing its global end further out of sight and thus out of reach.</p> <p>Political and social contexts fundamentally shape the pandemic’s medical end. In places such as Kenya, Covid-19 <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1600-0498.12295\">interacts with continuing outbreaks</a> of HIV/Aids, Ebola, cholera and tuberculosis. Understanding the end of epidemics as a drawn-out process, in which disease continues on even after our attention fades, explains long-term and global patterns of epidemics.</p> <p>While we are drawn to tales of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/18/how-do-pandemics-end-in-different-ways-but-its-never-quick-and-never-neat\">quick and effective solutions</a> to end outbreaks, such as <a href=\"https://www.immunology.org/john-snows-pump-1854\">John Snow’s removal</a> of the Broad Street pump handle to end London’s 1854 cholera outbreak, such stories are <a href=\"https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.CNT.5.130194\">often fables</a> – not only did Snow never remove the handle, but cholera was declining at the time for other reasons. The true account of cholera’s end in London was gradual, requiring political negotiation over how to implement improved urban infrastructure and sanitation alongside slow social improvements – rather than the incisive insight and decisive action of one individual. And, as with HIV/Aids, regardless of modern epidemiological knowledge, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera\">cholera outbreaks continue to this day</a> – tied to political and social crises.</p> <p>Epidemics are not a series of discrete biological events that simply pass into history with the disappearance of the disease. They are also moral crises, testing the limits of social cohesion and trust. As we are seeing now for Covid-19, the end process is a period of moral reckoning, with discussions of “lessons learned” and the crafting of narratives featuring heroes and villains. We seem to be in the midst of such a process, as medical experts debate what are acceptable infection rates, politicians debate the implications of lifting restrictions, and we debate with our relatives, friends and neighbours how best to live our lives.</p> <ul> <li><p>Erica Charters is professor of the global history of medicine at the University of Oxford, where she leads a multidisciplinary project on <a href=\"https://epidemics.web.ox.ac.uk/\">How Epidemics End</a></p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/28/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-8-everton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T11:01:04Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2022-23 preview No 8: Everton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-8-everton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/28/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-8-everton","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2022-23 preview No 8: Everton","trailText":"Last season was a disaster at Goodison, but Everton did ultimately stay up and Frank Lampard will be hoping they are stronger for the experience","byline":"Andy Hunter","body":"<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position</strong> 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> \n<p><strong>Last season’s position </strong>16th</p> \n<p><strong>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) </strong>500-1</p> \n<h2>Prospects</h2> \n<p>Did an expensively assembled squad seriously underperform last season or has the rot set in following years of mis-management by the club’s hierarchy? It falls to Frank Lampard to demonstrate it was the former, while being the latest Everton manager to be constrained by the latter, in his first full campaign in charge.</p> \n<p>Lampard called for decisive action in the transfer market after the torturous late escape. Instead, owner Farhad Moshiri has asked to be judged at the end of the window having sold the best player, Richarlison, for an initial £50m to improve the balance sheet and faced renewed protests over his running of the club before the campaign has even begun.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9acf4516-0fee-49db-820d-4a9408054c96\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y-TNSr0TeSU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The unity that developed between the fanbase and Lampard’s side last season, and played an instrumental role in Premier League survival, does not extend to those at the top. Lampard – his plea for reinforcements now finally being answered – can at least start anew with his vision for the team having spent the first months of his reign in game-by-game survival mode to preserve Everton’s top-flight status.</p> \n<p>Whether the same group can adapt to his demands for greater intensity, pressing and speed<strong> </strong>without Richarlison will be key. The manager remains sensibly realistic on Everton’s development. “We’ll do it in steps,” he said. “We can’t expect next year we’re going to go to the moon. It won’t be that process from where we were last year. It will be a process of what’s the first thing we can improve and then keep on improving and that’s where we’re at now.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/everton/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>One resource Lampard will not lack is the backing of the Everton crowd. The former Chelsea and Derby manager galvanised a previously divided and disillusioned fanbase following his appointment in January when, as is conveniently overlooked by his detractors, Everton were statistically the worst performing side in the Premier League under Rafael Benítez. Lampard inherited a team in free-fall, with confidence, spirit and performance levels all heading in the same direction, but eventually created a resilient group that answered criticism about its character to survive in the penultimate game. There were mis-steps along the way – the signings of Dele Alli and Donny van de Beek made little impact, although both were rushed through with Lampard appointed 24 hours before the transfer deadline, while attempts to play on the front foot led to some punishing defeats before a pragmatic style won out. A crash course in life at Everton, followed by a first pre-season, offers a foundation to build on.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bdd4ca6c2381bb8a18e8712c4743908ac6d6b599\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdd4ca6c2381bb8a18e8712c4743908ac6d6b599/0_263_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Tarkowski has joined from relegated Burnley and it is hoped he will add steel and experience to Everton’s back line.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Tarkowski has joined from relegated Burnley and it is hoped he will add steel and experience to Everton’s back line.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony McArdle/Everton FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Several deals appear to be falling into place amid another summer of financial constraint and, as Moshiri claims, the squad could look very different at the close of the window than at the start. But James Tarkowski, signed on a free following his exit from relegated Burnley, is the only valid answer at the time of writing. That is not to understate the importance of his arrival.<strong> </strong>The 29-year-old brings many qualities Everton lacked in central defence last season – leadership, aerial prowess (Tarkowski ranked second for aerial duels won in the Premier League in 2021/22) and a reliable fitness record, having started more than 30 league games in each of the past five seasons.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>It reflects the paucity of Everton’s squad that only Jordan Pickford looks certain to go to the World Cup, although he could be accompanied by Dominic Calvert-Lewin should the striker regain the fitness and form that eluded him last season. Anthony Gordon’s progress could also result in a late call-up. With almost a full squad at their disposal Everton have agreed to play Celtic and Western Sydney Wanderers in the inaugural Sydney Super Cup between 20-23 November.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:30:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Everton\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:30:10/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>Art of the Terraces – an exhibition celebrating the culture of football “casuals” in the 1970s, 80s and 90s through fashion, art and football – opens at the superb Walker Art Gallery on 5 November, just before the Premier League stops for the winter World Cup.</p> \n<h2>Leading the shirt sales</h2> \n<p>Gordon has inherited the No 10 jersey from Gylfi Sigurdsson and the mantle of crowd favourite from Richarlison this summer. The homegrown talent enjoyed a fine breakthrough season last time out, despite the relegation pressures and turmoil that surrounded his boyhood club, leading to transfer interest from Tottenham and Newcastle. Frank Lampard has insisted the 21-year-old is going nowhere and is central to his rebuilding plans. Goodison Park would be in revolt if a player that Evertonians identify with as one of their own was sold.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>With Richarlison’s sale to Tottenham Everton lost a vital component of their attack and their most entertaining wind-up merchant on social media. Dele Alli retains a strong presence with almost 8m followers on Instagram, although Everton will be hoping it is not merely the playmaker’s lifestyle and fashion sense that dominates his profile this season. The former England international started one Premier League game following his January switch from Spurs – the final day’s dead-rubber drubbing at Arsenal – but could make a huge difference should he recapture old form. He is only 26 after all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>If Everton were a Netflix doc …</h2> \n<p>A meeting of a board that has presided over losses of £372.6m in the last three financial years, appointed six permanent managers and three directors of football in the last six years, outspent most clubs in Europe in that period only to end up with a relegation-threatened team and conducted a strategic review into its football operations without looking in the mirror would make compulsive – and maybe terrifying – viewing.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/28/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-they-enjoyed-in-july","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"What we’re reading: writers and readers on the books they enjoyed in July","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/28/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-they-enjoyed-in-july","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/28/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-they-enjoyed-in-july","fields":{"headline":"What we’re reading: writers and readers on the books they enjoyed in July","trailText":"Prize judges, writers and Guardian reader Russell discuss the titles they’ve read over the last month.

This month, recommendations include excellent nonfiction about migration, immersive romance novels and a sharp account of the coronavirus pandemic. Tell us what you’ve been reading in the comments.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Hannah Giorgis, writer</h2> <p>I read romance novels year-round, but something about the sun shining for more than three consecutive days makes me want nothing more than to lie in the grass with a whole pile of them. It’s not strictly a romance, but Corinne Hoex’s <strong>Gentlemen Callers</strong> is a scintillating portrait of a woman in pursuit of pleasure. I bought the novel, translated from French by Caitlin O’Neil, within minutes of reading <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/03/corinne-hoex-gentlemen-callers-review/627203/\">this lovely essay in The Atlantic </a>. <strong>The Sex Lives of African Women</strong>, meanwhile, offers an exhilaratingly frank series of confessional narratives anthologised by Nana Darkoah Sekyiamah. That one will take me some time to finish – I know I’m not ready to leave those stories behind.</p> <p>I’m also still working my way through the intellectual revelation that is Nadia Nurhussein’s <strong>Black Land: Imperial Ethiopianism and African America</strong>. Nurhussein writes with clarity and critical precision about the significance and ironies of the singular position Ethiopia occupies in the diasporic imagination. Though her work is nonfiction, spending time with Nurhussein’s writing often prompts me to turn back toward Caribbean literature, especially novels and poetry. For me, and for many others, it was the indelible George Lamming who loomed especially large last month.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/565c3d39e4b027c789ba5b70/t/629e218585f50f72105f74ac/1654530437983/A+Double+Edged+Inheritance+-+Hannah+Giorgis+%28Addis+Abba+Noir%29.pdf\">A Double-Edged Inheritance by Hannah Giorgis</a> was shortlisted for the 2022 AKO Caine prize for African writing.</em></p> <h2>***</h2> <h2>Russell, Guardian reader</h2> <p>I have recently read Devi Sridhar’s <strong>Preventable</strong>, probably the best account I have read of the response to the pandemic here and across the world. Her chief concern is that we should learn the lessons from what happened, in particular from those countries that dealt successfully with the outbreak by adopting a strategy of suppression, rather than containment. Currently, I’m enjoying Caroline Elkins’ <strong>Legacy of Violence</strong>, dispelling myths about the “goodness” of the British empire with devastating evidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dc16871bcfe9a4ba9159b6b6637728780a93d62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dc16871bcfe9a4ba9159b6b6637728780a93d62/0_772_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Devi Sridhar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devi Sridhar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <h2>Adam Roberts, writer and professor</h2> <p>Deciding the Orwell prize for fiction, along with my excellent fellow judges, has been a wonderful experience, although it has also, inevitably, been pretty time-consuming – so many books to read! In the run-up to the announcement of the winner on the 14 July I reread the winner, Claire Keegan’s exquisite and amazing <strong>Small Things Like These</strong>. At a little more than 100 pages reading it doesn’t take long, but few books of any length are so penetrating, well-written or memorable. It’s the story of Bill Furlong, a 1980s coal merchant in a small Irish town, a decent family man who makes a delivery to a convent and discovers a neglected young girl working in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/05/magdalene-laundries-ireland-state-guilt\">Magdalene laundry</a>. Will he do the “right thing” by her? Keegan writes with exquisite clarity and penetration, and her 100 pages open us into a richer world than most writers could evoke with 1,000.</p> <p>Freed from the requirement to read as a prize judge, I’m now … reading <em>other</em> award lists. The <a href=\"https://clarkeaward.com/\">shortlist for the Clarke award, the UK’s blue-riband science fiction prize, has just been announced</a>, so I’m diving into the two nominated titles I haven’t already read: Mercurio Rivera’s space-opera <strong>Wergen: the Alien Love War</strong> and Aliya Whiteley’s <strong>Skyward Inn</strong>. But at least I don’t have to decide who the winner will be!</p> <p><em>The This by Adam Roberts is published by Orion</em><em>.

Delivery charges may apply.</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Joshua Chizoma, writer</h2> <p>I’m currently reading <strong>Open Water</strong> by Caleb Azumah Nelson. I have been for quite a while now. Usually, I do my best to run through a book quickly. But something about the quality of writing in this book tells the reader to slow down, savour the elegance of every sentence, pause and ponder on the wisdom it shares. While I am usually not drawn to romance stories, I am intrigued by the love story in Open Water, to the point that I keep coming back to admire the insistence of the affection the primary characters share.</p> <p>And a novel is not just about one thing, and this one also explores the interrogation of the black body as an alien in the UK. This is particularly interesting to me as a Nigerian writer who recently visited London for the first time. I had scarcely landed before I experienced my first case of racial profiling.</p> <p>Open Water is also an excellent depiction of how art forms meander and meet each other. In it, photography, writing and music all come together so perfectly. It will stay with me for a long time. I know it.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/565c3d39e4b027c789ba5b70/t/629e209e8eea8b56b08d9c17/1654530206766/Collector+of+Memories+Joshua+Chizoma+%28Afritondo%29.pdf\">Collector of Memories by Joshua Chizoma</a> was shortlisted for the 2022 AKO Caine prize for African writing.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23f09c314f96548d4bcbaedd62ad3a2981b182fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23f09c314f96548d4bcbaedd62ad3a2981b182fb/0_0_1902_1141/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caleb Azumah Nelson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caleb Azumah Nelson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <h2>David Edgerton, historian</h2> <p>I have had the privilege of chairing the judges of the Orwell prize for political writing this year – so how could I not say something about our fantastic winner? Sally Hayden’s <strong>My Fourth Time, We Drowned: Seeking Refuge on the World’s Deadliest Migration Route</strong><strong> </strong>is an extraordinary investigation of a topic that people deliberately ignore: the reality of the lives of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and get into Europe. What is especially rich about the book is that the migrants themselves speak not after the fact, but during their ordeals. So, although they are often out of sight when it comes to television and the usual forms of journalism, their stories are told through often secret exchanges on social media. And the way they tell their stories, and the way Hayden brings them to us, is extraordinarily compelling.</p> <p>Two other books on our shortlist speak in different ways to these same themes. I was thinking about Kei Miller’s <strong>Things I Have Withheld</strong><strong> </strong>when hearing about Mo Farah’s recent revelation that he was trafficked into the UK as a child. Miller’s book is a beautifully written meditation on what is said, and what is unsaid; on what cannot be said; and on what it is to belong and not belong. It is also a study of violence and its impact, racial violence in particular. In the end, like Mo Farah, he speaks, but will we hear?</p> <p>Michela Wrong’s <strong>Do Not Disturb: The Story of a Political Murder and an African Regime Gone Bad</strong><strong> </strong>is also an account of what is not said and what is not heard, in this case about the Kagame regime in Rwanda to which the British government is proposing to deport the very people Sally Hayden writes about with such humanity. It is also a remarkable study in the exercise of power by a small elite, and systematic mendacity in politics – which also resonates with our current moment. All three books show us just how important it is that we tell each other the truth about power.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/192782/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-british-nation-by-edgerton-david/9780141975979\">The Rise and Fall of the British Nation: A Twentieth-Century History</a> by David Edgerton is published by Penguin</em><em>.</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Letlhogonolo Mokgoroane</strong><strong>, co-founder of The Cheeky Natives podcast and judge for AKO Caine </strong><strong>prize 2022</strong></h2> <p>I was waiting for Warsan Shire’s eagerly awaited debut poetry collection B<strong>less the Daughter Raised By a Voice in Her Head</strong>, I devoured this book greedily because I loved <strong>Teaching </strong><strong>My Mother How to Give Birth</strong>. Shire’s writing and clarity of thought is a marvel. Her book transported me to various places and memories, it felt like a continuation of the important themes explored in the earlier book. I suspect that I am going to be reading this book for a long time.<br><br>After that delightful read, I moved on to <strong>Christopher by Nozuko Siyothula</strong>, an extraordinary debut that deals with loss and grief set in South Africa.</p> <h2>***<br><strong>Okey Ndibe</strong><strong>, chair of judges for AKO Caine prize 2022</strong></h2> <p><br>Uwem Akpan’s debut novel, <strong>New York, My Village</strong>, is a worthy follow-up to his audacious story collection <strong>Say You’re One of Them</strong>. It’s a magisterial read, one of those rare novels that – because they are bristly, unsparing, challenging and capacious – are bound for timelessness but take their time winning fans.<br><br>There are two main story tracks in the novel – the tragic drama of Nigeria’s civil war told for the first time in a major novel through the perspective of the country’s minority ethnic groups, and the world of big-time publishing, fraught with myopia, racism and other cruelties.<br><br>I was a child during Nigeria’s ruinous war, often styled the Biafran war, in which more than two million people perished. As a witness to the war’s grimness – starvation, days marred by gunshots, the kaboom of mortars, ubiquitous death – the war stole my childhood innocence. As a young adult, I made a point of reading as many books on the war as I could find. But until I read Akpan’s book, it had not occurred to me that there was a lacuna in my understanding of the war.<br><br>Akpan’s novel offers a harrowing account of how the country’s hapless minority groups were often caught in a vice – trapped between brutish Biafran soldiers and savage Nigerian forces. I expect the book, in time, to herald a much-needed conversation in Nigeria not only about the full cost of the war but also about the meaning of Nigeria, a British-made entity that continues to confound its citizens as well as foreign observers.<br><br>The novel’s protagonist, Ekong, briefly relocates from Nigeria to New York – arguably the capital of book publishing – to hold a fellowship at a publishing company. His vantage point enables him – and us – to grasp the parochial impulses that inform what one might call the politics of publishing.<br><br>I can’t help wondering whether the novel’s unflattering portrait of the publishing industry is responsible for the lukewarm attention it has so far received.<br><br>Still, the novel does its work with such virtuosic power and incandescent intelligence that, inevitably, many readers will find it, find themselves enlarged by it, and fall in love with it.<br><br><em>Okey Ndibe is the author of the novels Arrows of Rain and Foreign Gods, Inc, and the memoir Never Look </em><em>an American in the Eye.

The 37-year-old Geva Mentor and 38-year-old Jade Clarke together account for more than a third of England’s 925 caps, which make the Roses one of the most tested teams in Birmingham.</p> \n<p>Five players – Mentor, Harten, Helen Housby, Stacey Francis-Bayman and Eboni Usoro-Brown – compete in Australia’s Super Netball league while the remaining seven – Metcalfe, Clarke, Eleanor Cardwell, Laura Malcolm, Sophie Drakeford-Lewis, Layla Guscoth and Imogen Allison – are based in the UK’s Superleague.</p> \n<p>Notably absent are 2018 gold medallists Serena Guthrie and Beth Cobden.

To do that will involve navigating past some tricky teams, namely Malawi and Uganda who both possess formidable shooting talent, but the major task will be defeating New Zealand.

Scissor Sisters – Only the Horses (2012)</h2> <p>Having met Jake Shears during sessions for Kylie Minogue’s 2010 album, Aphrodite, Harris was asked to do some extra knob-twiddling on this barnstorming single from the band’s Magic Hour album. The lyrics eschew camp in favour of melancholic soul-searching, while Harris guides the song into its chorus with an audible snap, like a discharging party popper.</p> <h2>19. Calvin Harris – Hard to Love ft Jessie Reyez (2017)</h2> <p>While 2017’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/30/calvin-harris-funk-wav-bounces-vol-1-review-edm-post-disco-rihanna-pharrell-solo-album\">career-redefining Funk Wav Bounces Vol 1</a> dabbled in laid-back funk, 80s bounce and disco, it was this album closer – anchored by Canadian-Colombian Reyez’s roughly hewn vocal – that showed Harris could do downtempo. Over a simple scratchy guitar figure and pitter-patter beats, Reyez is allowed the space to pull the listener into her orbit.</p> <h2>18. Love Regenerator – Lonely ft Riva Starr and Sananda Maitreya (2022)</h2> <p>In recent years, Harris has funnelled his more dance-leaning output through his Love Regenerator pseudonym, creating ad-hoc singles that feel less pressured than his major-label output. The best of the bunch is the slowly unfurling Lonely, which features additional production from Riva Starr and a gorgeous central performance from the artist formerly known as Terence Trent D’Arby.</p> <h2>17. Sophie Ellis Bextor – Off &amp; On (2011)</h2> <p>Originally recorded, although not used, by Róisín Murphy for her 2007 pop opus Overpowered, this Cathy Dennis co-write eventually found its way to Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Utilising an oscillating synth riff to anchor the lyrics’ sense of confusion, it eventually starts to disintegrate like the relationship Ellis-Bextor is airily describing.</p> <h2>16. Calvin Harris – New Money ft 21 Savage (2022)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUVw1PTO6Sc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TUVw1PTO6Sc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Of the handful of Funk Wav Bounces Vol 2 singles to emerge so far – all crowded by guest stars fighting for their 10 seconds in the sun – only this svelte slice of cascading funk has a chorus that sticks. And what a chorus it is, with Atlanta rapper 21 Savage cooing: “Gucci garments / Kush smell like armpits,” over Harris’ strutting bass.</p> <h2>15. Calvin Harris – Acceptable in the 80s (2007)</h2> <p>With an instantly recognisable central riff – utilised ad infinitum on various Channel 4 TV shows – Acceptable in the 80s channels the titular decade and the playful electronic mode of Around the World-era Daft Punk. Any hint of French fancy is undermined, however, by Harris’ deadpan singing style.</p> <h2>14. Dizzee Rascal – Dance Wiv Me (2008)</h2> <p>Head turned by Acceptable in the 80s, Dizzee Rascal asked Harris to be part of his pop-leaning fourth album, Tongue n’ Cheek. As well as conjuring up the song’s gloriously sloshed backing track – referred to by <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13573-tongue-n-cheek/\">Pitchfork as sounding like “H&amp;M disco”</a> – Harris delivers some key lines including the brilliant instruction: “Tell your boyfriend hold your jar.”</p> <h2>13. Cheryl – Call My Name (2012)</h2> <p>While it definitely suffers from being a We Found Love redux, there is something beautifully basic about the way Call My Name hoovers up various EDM strands. From the simple synth riff and signposted drops to the lacklustre “ah, oh, oh, oh” ad-libs, so much of it feels phoned in, yet as a whole it carries a strange magic.</p> <h2>12. Calvin Harris – Slide ft Frank Ocean and Migos (2017)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ee4QjCEHHc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8Ee4QjCEHHc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Calvin Harris: Slide ft Frank Ocean and Migos – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As Funk Wav Bounces Vol 1’s lead single – and Harris’ slinky sidestep away from pure dance – Slide had some pretty heavy lifting to do. Built around a breezy, handclap-heavy beat and warm organ sounds, it features a horizontal-sounding Frank Ocean sleepily ekeing out the song’s chorus before Migos quickly counters that energy with a delirious verse.</p> <h2>11. Calvin Harris – Outside ft Ellie Goulding (2014)</h2> <p>Outside – the pair’s second collaboration following 2012’s I Need Your Love – places Goulding’s ethereal voice lightly atop a swirl of strings that eventually form the song’s piercing riff. While other songs from 2014’s hit-heavy album, Motion, tried hard to tick dance-pop’s boxes, Outside feels relatively restrained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bc85ed623ab87e538ff1dec081d9cc0ec2409cf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc85ed623ab87e538ff1dec081d9cc0ec2409cf9/1259_0_3333_4165/800.jpg\" alt=\"Normani performing at the 2021 MTV Video Music awards.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Normani performing at the 2021 MTV Video Music awards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Theo Wargo/Getty Images for MTV/ViacomCBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. Normani x Calvin Harris – Checklist ft Wizkid (2018)</h2> <p>Six months after the demise of the sporadically good girlband Fifth Harmony, every discerning pop fan’s favourite member, Normani, teamed up with Harris for two singles. The pick of the pair is this Afroswing-inspired, Wizkid-assisted banger, which finds Normani half-rapping her frustrations over a nocturnal, club-ready beat that seems to ooze sweat from its pores.</p> <h2>9. Calvin Harris – This Is What You Came For ft Rihanna (2016)</h2> <p>Co-writer Taylor Swift was originally credited under a pseudonym to avoid her brief relationship with Harris dominating the discourse; Harris later confirmed the co-write, but pointedly noted he “wrote the music, produced the song, arranged it and cut the vocals”. Despite initially being overshadowed by the drama surrounding its creation, this third Harris/Rihanna collaboration is a downbeat-yet-danceable opus that swirls like a tornado.</p> <h2>8. Calvin Harris – I’m Not Alone (2009)</h2> <p>Described by Harris as “a big stadium dance tune, somewhere between Snow Patrol, Faithless and Grandaddy”, the melancholic I’m Not Alone starts small, with Harris intoning mournfully over a scratchy guitar riff, before suddenly building to its glow-sticks-in-the-air climax. Part of the US EDM explosion, in 2010 it was sampled by Chris Brown on his US Top 10 single Yeah 3x.</p> <h2>7. Rita Ora – I Will Never Let You Down (2014)</h2> <p>Channelling the overwhelming joy of 80s Whitney, this 2014 single – solely written and produced by Harris – is built around a squirming synth riff that slowly detonates into the song’s skyscraping chorus. In fact, just when you think it has peaked, Harris unleashes a heavily filtered guitar riff for an extra dash of hysteria.</p> <h2>6. Kylie Minogue – In My Arms (2007)</h2> <p>Harris’s first high-profile production for another artist, In My Arms encases a lovely lyric about the power of a good hug in a hermetically sealed electropop confection. Starting with a delicious spoken-word intro that poses pop’s eternal question – “How do you describe a feeling?” – the song is quickly launched skywards by Harris and co-producer Biff Stannard via a cavalcade of synths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"54b2b23224679d00c4bb18a2aff1db79b2125baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54b2b23224679d00c4bb18a2aff1db79b2125baa/0_0_5010_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dua Lipa at the Primavera Sound festival in Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dua Lipa at the Primavera Sound festival in Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alejandro García/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5. Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa – One Kiss (2018)</h2> <p>Eschewing EDM for a club-ready BPM, the sophisticated, Brit-award-winning One Kiss finds Harris dabbling in everything from UK garage to diva house, its post-chorus a wordless nostalgia spiral back to 90s dancefloors. Dua Lipa’s typically aloof vocal performance makes its lyrical come-on feel strangely tinged with sadness.</p> <h2>4. Calvin Harris – Bounce ft Kelis (2011)</h2> <p>After a run of singles featuring his own … <em>unique</em> vocals, Harris utilised Kelis’s deliciously husky tones on this buoyant lead track from his third album, 18 Months. “We bounce to this track / And I don’t care what anyone thinks about that,” she sings nonchalantly over a pinging synth riff that slowly builds into one of his best hands-aloft explosions.</p> <h2>3. Calvin Harris – Feels ft Pharrell, Katy Perry and Big Sean (2017)</h2> <p>After helping confirm EDM as the planet’s biggest, noisiest genre, Harris changed tack on his fifth album, Funk Wav Bounces Vol 1, switching pounding house riffs and earthquaking drops for featherlight disco. The relaxed pace works perfectly on this sun-drenched UK No 1, in which an audibly smiling Pharrell and a restrained Perry, piña colada in hand, slink around Harris’ airy production.</p> <h2>2. Calvin Harris and Sam Smith – Promises (2018)</h2> <p>Featuring playful, giggly background vocals from co-writer Reyez, the heady Promises feels buoyed up by the rush of new love. Harris allows Smith’s soaring vocals to shine and finesses the production with house-style piano stabs, roving bass and delicate little funk guitar flourishes. It is a further reminder that Smith should swap bloated balladry for lithe dance music for good.</p> <h2>1. Rihanna ft Calvin Harris – We Found Love (2011)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg00YEETFzg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tg00YEETFzg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Rihanna ft Calvin Harris: We Found Love – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Originally recorded by Leona Lewis and later offered to Nicole Scherzinger, the strangely profound We Found Love’s journey to Rihanna may have been bumpy, but it is difficult to imagine it being sung so well by anyone else. Solely written and produced by Harris – a rarity in a pop world where credits often read like Wikipedia entries – it is a dance banger that celebrates simplicity even while discussing something as complex as love. Harris conjures up a frantic backdrop of two-finger synth riffs and firing EDM beats, while Rihanna’s repeated mantra of “we found love in a hopeless place” shifts from being an ingeniously simple pop lyric to somehow encapsulating every unspoken emotion. Cementing Rihanna’s superstar status, it propelled Harris into the production big leagues.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2022/jul/28/deepmind-uncovers-structure-of-200m-proteins-in-scientific-leap-forward","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"DeepMind uncovers structure of 200m proteins in scientific leap forward","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/28/deepmind-uncovers-structure-of-200m-proteins-in-scientific-leap-forward","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/jul/28/deepmind-uncovers-structure-of-200m-proteins-in-scientific-leap-forward","fields":{"headline":"DeepMind uncovers structure of 200m proteins in scientific leap forward","trailText":"Success of AlphaFold program could have huge impact on global problems such as famine and disease","byline":"Linda Geddes Science correspondent","body":"<p>Artificial intelligence has deciphered the structure of virtually every protein known to science, paving the way for the development of new medicines or technologies to tackle global challenges such as famine or pollution.</p> <p>Proteins are the building blocks of life. Formed of chains of amino acids, folded up into complex shapes, their 3D structure largely determines their function. Once you know how a protein folds up, you can start to understand how it works, and how to change its behaviour. Although DNA provides the instructions for making the chain of amino acids, predicting how they interact to form a 3D shape was more tricky and, until recently, scientists had only deciphered a fraction of the 200m or so proteins known to science.</p> <p>In November 2020, the AI group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/30/deepmind-ai-cracks-50-year-old-problem-of-biology-research\">DeepMind</a> announced it had developed a program called AlphaFold that could rapidly predict this information using an algorithm. Since then, it has been crunching through the genetic codes of every organism that has had its genome sequenced, and predicting the structures of the hundreds of millions of proteins they collectively contain.</p> <p>Last year, DeepMind published the protein structures for 20 species – including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/22/ai-firm-deepmind-puts-database-building-blocks-life-human-protein-structure-free-online\">nearly all 20,000 proteins expressed by humans</a> – on an open <a href=\"https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/\">database</a>. Now it has finished the job, and released predicted structures for more than 200m proteins.</p> <p>“Essentially, you can think of it as covering the entire protein universe. It includes predictive structures for plants, bacteria, animals, and many other organisms, opening up huge new opportunities for AlphaFold to have an impact on important issues, such as sustainability, food insecurity, and neglected diseases,” said Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s founder and chief executive.</p> <p>Scientists are already using some of its earlier predictions to help develop new medicines. In May, researchers led by Prof Matthew Higgins at the University of Oxford <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.24.493318v1.full\">announced</a> they had used AlphaFold’s models to help determine the structure of a key malaria parasite protein, and work out where antibodies that could block transmission of the parasite were likely to bind.</p> <p>“Previously, we’d been using a technique called protein crystallography to work out what this molecule looks like, but because it’s quite dynamic and moves around, we just couldn’t get to grips with it,” Higgins said. “When we took the AlphaFold models and combined them with this experimental evidence, suddenly it all made sense. This insight will now be used to design improved vaccines which induce the most potent transmission-blocking antibodies.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>AlphaFold’s models are also being used by scientists at the University of Portsmouth’s Centre for Enzyme Innovation, to identify enzymes from the natural world that could be tweaked to digest and recycle plastics. “It took us quite a long time to go through this massive database of structures, but opened this whole array of new three-dimensional shapes we’d never seen before that could actually break down plastics,” said Prof John McGeehan, who is leading the work. “There’s a complete paradigm shift. We can really accelerate where we go from here – and that helps us direct these precious resources to the stuff that matters.”</p> <p>Prof Dame Janet Thornton, the group leader and senior scientist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute, said: “AlphaFold protein structure predictions are already being used in a myriad of ways. I expect that this latest update will trigger an avalanche of new and exciting discoveries in the months and years ahead, and this is all thanks to the fact that the data are available openly for all to use.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/28/liz-truss-promises-to-build-northern-powerhouse-rail-scaled-back-last-year","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T10:44:38Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss revives promise to build Northern Powerhouse Rail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/liz-truss-promises-to-build-northern-powerhouse-rail-scaled-back-last-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/28/liz-truss-promises-to-build-northern-powerhouse-rail-scaled-back-last-year","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss revives promise to build Northern Powerhouse Rail","trailText":"Tory leadership frontrunner commits to building Liverpool-Hull line, nine months after government scaled back plans","byline":"Josh Halliday North of England correspondent","body":"<p>Liz Truss has committed to building Northern Powerhouse Rail if she becomes prime minister, nine months after her government radically scaled back plans for a high-speed line across the north of England.</p> <p>The Tory leadership frontrunner said the multibillion-pound coast-to-coast line, stretching from Liverpool to Hull, was “absolutely crucial for the future of the north of England”.</p> <p>Speaking in Leeds, where she grew up, on Thursday, Truss said: “I know how poor the transport is and, frankly, it’s not got much better since I was a teenager getting the bus into Leeds city centre.</p> <p>“What I want to see is really fantastic rail services, better roads so people are able to get into work.</p> <p>“I also want to stop militant action by the trade unions, so that hard-working people who do the right thing can get into work, set up businesses and help grow our economy.”</p> <p>Truss told the Northern Agenda newsletter before the first hustings debate for Tory members in Leeds: “I want to build an aspiration nation that unleashes opportunity for all, no matter where you live or where you grow up.

There has been no formal confirmation from the speaker or the White House, and Taipei will not comment until there has.</p> <p>Supporters of the trip say it would be a strong show of support for Taiwan, which Beijing claims is a breakaway Chinese province which must be reunified, by force if necessary. However, some have expressed concern that the timing – reported to be next month – comes at a particularly sensitive moment in domestic Chinese politics which could cause a more aggressive response from the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.</p> <p>“Any member that wants to go, should. It shows political deterrence to President Xi,” McCaul told NBC. “But [Pelosi] should also pay attention to the military if it’s going to cause a blowback and escalate things.”</p> <p>Beijing has made strong objections to a visit by Pelosi, who would be the highest ranked US government official since the then House speaker Newt Gingrich visited in 1997. Officials have warned of “consequences” should the visit go ahead, with some speculation there could be military activity which could escalate or cause an accident.</p> <p>In recent years the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) air force has sent increasing numbers of warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) amid a ratcheting up of “greyzone” activities designed to test Taiwan’s responsiveness and wear out its resources.</p> <p>On Monday, Japan’s defence ministry reported that a Chinese armed reconnaissance drone had flown near Taiwan on a solo mission for the first time. It tracked the PLA’s TB-001 drone through the Miyako Strait, from the East China Sea into the Pacific near Taiwan. The next day, Taiwan’s president boarded a warship in the area to inspect defence drills, prompting some analysts to suggest the drone flight was a warning. Taiwan’s military exercises this week are scheduled annually and are not specifically connected to current events.</p> <p>It was not clear where the drone’s journey ended, with some news outlets reporting that it circumnavigated the island.

I mean, the threats are so frequent that we do not have to over-interpret them.”</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-us-military-security\">US officials said</a> that if Pelosi went to Taiwan, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military\">US military</a> would increase movement of forces and assets in the Indo-Pacific. On Thursday, the South China Morning Post reported that a US strike group, led by the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, had left Singapore – where it had been conducting a port visit – in the direction of the South China Sea. It had previously been deployed to Yokosuka, Japan. The reason for its current journey was not clear, and the American representative office in Taipei declined to comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/28/share-your-views-on-the-sacking-of-shadow-transport-minister-sam-tarry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T10:35:24Z","webTitle":"Share your views on the sacking of shadow transport minister Sam Tarry ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/28/share-your-views-on-the-sacking-of-shadow-transport-minister-sam-tarry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/28/share-your-views-on-the-sacking-of-shadow-transport-minister-sam-tarry","fields":{"headline":"Share your views on the sacking of shadow transport minister Sam Tarry ","trailText":"We would like to hear your thoughts on Tarry’s sacking as a Labour frontbencher after joining a rail strikes picket line","byline":"Guardian community team","body":"<p>Sam Tarry, shadow transport minister and MP for Ilford, was sacked as a Labour frontbencher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2022/jul/27/train-strikes-rail-disruption-uk-live-latest-travel-updates\">after joining a rail strikes picket line on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>We would like to hear from Labour party supporters about your views on Tarry’s sacking.

Everyone can, in whatever place on Earth they call home. No one needs to wait for politicians any more – we have been waiting for them for decades. What history shows us is that when people lead, governments follow. Our power resides in what we are witnessing. We cannot deny that Great Salt Lake is vanishing before our eyes into a sun-cracked playa of salt and toxic chemicals. Nor can we deny that Lake Mead is reduced to a puddle. In New Mexico a wildfire that began in early April is still burning in late July. Last August, the eye of Hurricane Ida split in two – there was no calm – only 190mph winds ripping towns in the bayous of Louisiana to shreds; and 7m acres in the American west burned in 2021.

The 2,000 individuals who recently died of heat in Portugal and Spain are not here to bear witness, but many of the residents of Jacobabad in Pakistan, where Amnesty International declared the temperatures “unlivable for humans”, are. The heat-warped rails of the British train system, the buckled roads, cry out that this is unprecedented. The estimated billion sea creatures who died on the Pacific north-west’s coast from last summer’s heatwave announced a climate emergency. The heat-devastated populations of southern Asia, the current grain crop failures in China, India, across Europe and the American midwest, the starving in the Horn of Africa because of climate-caused drought, the bleached and dying coral reefs of Australia, the rivers of meltwater gushing from the Greenland ice sheet, the melting permafrost of Siberia and Alaska: all bear witness that this is a climate emergency. So do we. Yet the anxiety we feel, the grief that is ours, pales in comparison to the ferocity of our resolve.</p> <p>We can choose to live differently and build wiser and more just ways to produce, consume and travel. Our hope lies in our collective actions. A climate emergency means that it’s time for business as usual to halt, for our priorities to shift and to recognize our responsibility to those on the frontlines of the climate crisis. This emergency, which did not begin suddenly and will not end in our lifetimes, nevertheless needs our urgent response. This means doing all we can to stabilize the health of the planet and speed the transition away from fossil fuels. Now. Between the scientists and engineers, philosophers and poets, Indigenous leaders, climate activists and engaged youth, we know what to do and how to do it. We have a multiplicity of tools, we have a kaleidoscopic vision where each of us can offer up the gifts that are ours, and most importantly, we have the spiritual will to change the course of our destiny on fire.</p> <p>The future needs us. We need each other. At a time when the majority of Americans want to see serious climate action, too many politicians have failed us and undermined those who are trying. We ourselves must respond for those who will be born next week and next decade and next century, who need a planet alive and flourishing in all its exquisite diversity of land and creatures and humans. We have no right to rob them or the young people staring at a chaotic future now of their birthright. We do not represent them, but we can represent ourselves, as people in solidarity with all life. In that spirit, we join those around the world who have already declared a climate emergency, and we invite everyone to join us.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> <li><p>Terry Tempest Williams is a writer, naturalist, and activist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/28/chile-updating-constitution-us-should-follow","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T10:22:03Z","webTitle":"Chile is updating its constitution for the 21st century.

Fundamental rights denied, foundational institutions paralyzed and existential crises ignored: these are side-effects of a legal framework that has not been meaningfully amended in over a half-century.</p> <p>The US is not alone. Scores of constitutions around the world were written by dictators, colonizers and military occupiers to enshrine institutions that are undemocratic by design and unfit to cope with crises like a rapidly heating planet. In some cases, like the UK, the constitution was never actually written at all, setting the political system on a precarious foundation of norms and conventions that leaders like Boris Johnson have proven all too eager to discard. When a <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpolcon/371/371.pdf\">cross-party committee</a> convened in 2013 to review the UK’s constitutional chaos, its recommendation was nothing short of radical: that the government should consider “preparations for a UK-wide constitutional convention”.</p> <p>But while both the US and the UK remain trapped in constitutional deadlock, the Republic of Chile has just concluded its own nationwide convention to replace the 1980 decree by the dictator Augusto Pinochet and his military government. The product of the convention is a visionary document that would not only update, expand and advance Chileans’ basic rights – to health, housing, abortion, decent work and a habitable planet – but also set a new standard for democratic renewal in the 21st century.</p> <p>Like that of the United States, the current Chilean constitution was written under extremely undemocratic conditions. Pinochet came to power in a bloody coup to overthrow President Salvador Allende, and set to work designing a constitution that would consolidate executive power, constrain democratic representation, and enshrine free market fundamentalism. Along with a clique of economists known as the “Chicago Boys” for their training at the University of Chicago, Pinochet set the country on a path of such extreme neoliberalization that Chile would become the only country in the world with a constitutionally privatized water system.</p> <p>The consequences of the Pinochet constitution were all too easy to predict – and will be too familiar to readers in the US from which its ideas were sourced. Inequality soared: Chile became the most unequal country in the OECD, with an income gap 65% higher than the OECD average; the <a href=\"https://braveneweurope.com/branko-milanovic-chile-the-poster-boy-of-neoliberalism-who-fell-from-grace\">combined wealth of its billionaires</a> totals 25% of GDP. Debt exploded: Chile’s tuition fees rank among the <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/27fc15ff-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/27fc15ff-en\">highest in the world</a>, trapping students in cycles of debt repayment that can <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20191105-crippling-student-loans-contribute-to-chile-s-protests\">last a lifetime</a>. Precarity accelerated: the percentage of jobs on short-term contracts has grown to 30, while roughly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/pinochet-economic-model-current-crisis-chile\">half of all workers</a> report being unable to save enough to fund their retirement. Even its famous system of privatized water is crashing: by the end of 2021 more than half of Chile’s 19 million population lived in an area suffering from “severe water scarcity”, and in April an unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/11/santiago-chile-ration-water-drought\">water rationing plan</a> was announced for the capital, Santiago, as Chile moves into a period of <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/insights/ranking-worlds-most-water-stressed-countries-2040\">severe water stress</a>.</p> <p>In October 2019, millions of Chileans took to the streets to protest these intolerable conditions. Kicked off by a hike in public transportation fares by sitting president Sebastián Piñera, the protests quickly grew into a revolt against the country’s entire constitutional order – its neoliberal orthodoxy, its authoritarian governance, its absence of human rights protections that were on display in both Pinochet’s murderous regime and Piñera’s violent repression of the 2019 protests. <em>“Constituyente o nada!</em>” the protesters shouted: constituent assembly or nothing. One year later, Chileans turned out in record numbers to vote in a special plebiscite organized in the wake of the protest movement: 78% voted for a new constitution, and 79% for a convention of elected citizens to write it, rather than career politicians.</p> <p>At a time when democracies are ravaged by violent polarization, Chile’s convention has charted a path to peaceful renovation. Led by women, the convention brought together workers, Indigenous peoples and parties from across the political spectrum to draft a new constitution over the course of a year of careful deliberation. The result is a document that responds directly to the escalating crises of inequality, insecurity and a changing climate. The constitution establishes new universal public services for health, education, and clean water. It endows nature with rights and protects Chile’s glaciers, parks and big bodies of water from environmentally disastrous mining. And – four decades after Pinochet’s decree – it finally turns Chile into a full democracy, with gender parity in public institutions, self-determination for Indigenous peoples, collective bargaining for all workers and the right to vote for all Chileans over the age of 16.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now, Chile has shown the way to a new constitutional order ... that can set an example for the world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the campaign to de-legitimate Chile’s constitution is already under way. Even before the convention had taken its seat, commentators at the Wall Street Journal had labeled it a “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chiles-suicide-mission-11603052967\">suicide mission</a>”. Since then, a relentless “<a href=\"https://www.ciperchile.cl/2021/09/13/guerrilla-digital-contra-la-convencion-constituyente/\">digital war</a>” has been waged to discredit the new constitution by spreading lies and disinformation about its contents. One sitting Chilean senator falsely claimed that the constitution would change the country’s name, flag and national anthem, in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/m_lobosg/status/1452423621503299593\">video</a> that went viral across the country. Gender parity is mocked as “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/07/05/chile-constitution-draft-boric/\">woke</a>”. Worker rights are “<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Chile-Guardian-e058555d630d42b08ab4838c698b7884\">divisive</a>”. And Indigenous sovereignty is the path to an “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eldesconcierto/status/1520133126156173313?s=20&amp;t=igWn1nzX6_5Rzhzb9odtMQ\">Indigenous monarchy</a>”. In its editorial instructing Chileans to vote against the new constitution, the Economist put the new text on a roll of toilet paper. The goal of the attacks is simple: to scare Chileans into a defense of an indefensible status quo.</p> <p>But Chileans are undeterred. After all, the Economist praised the “rapid success” of the Pinochet coup back in 1973, and most of the parties that presently call to reject the new constitution are the same ones that voted to keep Pinochet in power in the 1988 plebiscite that ended his rule. More than a month before the September vote, the coalition to support the new constitution is growing around the world, exciting everyone from <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/07/chile-constitutional-convention-neoliberalism-pinochet-labor/\">feminists</a> to <a href=\"https://www.eldesconcierto.cl/reportajes/2022/07/12/apruebo-evangelico-sus-razones-para-respaldar-la-nueva-constitucion.html\">evangelicals</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepAndyLevin/status/1547253579047735302\">US politicians</a> to University of Chicago professors. “It’s kind of a miracle that it’s come this far,” <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-20/chaotic-chile-convention-defies-odds-on-new-charter-experts-say\">said</a> Tom Ginsburg, a University of Chicago professor. The “Apruebo” vote is still trailing in the polls, but enthusiasm for the plebiscite is on the rise. “This 4th of September, it will once again be the people who will have the last word on their destiny,” President Gabriel Boric <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabrielboric/status/1544031721955401728\">said</a>.</p> <p>But their destiny is ours, too. In the 20th century, the US constitution reigned as the model to be emulated by democracies around the world. No longer: its antiquated institutions and an absence of rights have guaranteed its <a href=\"https://www.nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-87-number-3/the-declining-influence-of-the-united-states-constitution/\">declining influence</a>. Now, Chile has shown the way to a new constitutional order – rich with rights, responsive to the needs of both people and planet – that can set an example for the world in the 21st century. Because, as even Thomas Jefferson recognized in 1789, “the earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead”.

He claimed there were unprecedented levels of anger at the lack of solidarity with workers taking industrial action.</p> <p>Starmer sacked Sam Tarry on Wednesday for giving a series of interviews from a picket line outside Euston station in central London that were not in line with party policy.

Go on there and wear a gag?”</p> <p>Unlike during the last rail strike, shadow ministers were not banned from attending picket lines.

The workers, I think they’ve got it right,” he told Sky News.</p> <p>Starmer had misread the mood of the general public, was alienating voters and causing unprecedented levels of anger in the Labour and trade union movement, said McDonnell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/labour-party-cost-of-living-keir-starmer-striking-workers\">What has happened to the Labour party that it can’t stand up for labour? | John McDonnell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A coordinated general strike by unions would be “the most effective thing to do”, McDonnell said.

And that is before you get to the work they have done in weakening their rivals, with Vadaine Oliver and Emmanuel Osadebe arriving from Gillingham and Walsall respectively. <strong>Northampton </strong>came agonisingly close last season – losing out on goals scored to Bristol Rovers on a barmy final day – but they are poised to go again and Danny Hylton, who scored 21 goals when he was last at this level with Luton four years ago, is among a handful of smart signings who should send them close.</p> <p>Northampton have had their captain, Fraser Horsfall, poached by big-spending <strong>Stockport</strong>,<strong> </strong>who will fancy their chances of successive promotions after an 11-year hiatus from the Football League. Stockport have long been preparing for this eventuality and are not there to make up the numbers. May’s trip to Wembley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/28/mansfield-port-vale-league-two-playoff-final-match-report\">ended in tears for </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/28/mansfield-port-vale-league-two-playoff-final-match-report\">Mansfield</a> </strong>but they can go one better under the savvy Nigel Clough. He has retained the bulk of his squad but knows another slow start – they won two of their first 14 games last season – would hinder such hopes.</p> <h2>Playoff hopefuls</h2> <p>Richie Wellens won the title in this division with Swindon, who have been ravaged for their best players, and his <strong>Leyton Orient </strong>side, which boasts plenty of attacking options, and his former club, <strong>Salford City,</strong> will both fancy their chances of making the top seven. Salford are yet to finish above eighth since being promoted into the division with grand plans and Neil Wood, formerly Manchester United’s under-23s coach, represents their fifth permanent manager in four years. The noises have been decidedly more low-key this summer, though, and that may just suit them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3418680d3c8a94ad6e13b86092fdcc854bc7d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3418680d3c8a94ad6e13b86092fdcc854bc7d17/0_164_3512_2107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Betsy during training with Arsenal’s Under-23s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Betsy (centre) and his assistant Dan Micciche are well-regarded in coaching circles and will hope to do well at Crawley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Burstow/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are US investors in the door at the Poundland Bescot Stadium, home to <strong>Walsall</strong> who have backed Michael Flynn to overhaul his squad. It remains to be seen if Flynn, who worked wonders at <strong>Newport County, </strong>has struck the right blend but Timmy Abraham, a raw striker who is the younger brother of the Roma striker Tammy, joins after a trial period and the 40-year-old Peter Clarke will add experience from <strong>Tranmere</strong>, who should be in the mix providing they remedy their poor away form. <strong>AFC Wimbledon</strong> have entrusted Johnnie Jackson with getting them back into League One at the first attempt and may be better equipped than <strong>Crewe</strong> and <strong>Doncaster, </strong>whose managers are unproven. Neil Harris has a thin squad at <strong>Gillingham</strong> who will be tested on their return to this level.</p> <p>Since the American consortium Wagmi United (the acronym stands for “We’re All Going to Make It”), whose money derives from cryptocurrency, took over <strong>Crawley </strong>in April, the sense has been that the experiment will either be a categorical success or an unmitigated disaster. Kevin Betsy, formerly Arsenal’s under-23 manager and his assistant, Dan Micciche, are well-regarded in coaching circles and the recruitment of Newport’s Dominic Telford, the league’s top scorer last season, and the Swindon captain Dion Conroy suggest at least another top-half finish. Then again, the owners are giving holders of club season tickets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) the chance to vote on which areas of the squad to strengthen. <strong>Stevenage </strong>will surely adopt a more regimented approach under Steve Evans and with a new-look squad, things could go either way. <strong>Swindon </strong>have been ravaged in the close-season and may have to settle for mid-table.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa2cd47660ff20849284f7a2ac964dd490a0e693\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa2cd47660ff20849284f7a2ac964dd490a0e693/0_182_3906_2344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grimsby Town celebrate promotion to League Two after defeating Solihull Moors at the London Stadium in early June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grimsby Town celebrate promotion to League Two after defeating Solihull Moors at the London Stadium in early June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Bardens/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Relegation candidates</h2> <p>In the absence of any clubs who are already resigned to their fate, this season may catch up with those who were circling the drain towards the end of the last campaign. <strong>Barrow</strong> appear on a slippery slope and have turned to Pete Wild as their fifth permanent manager in two years. They and <strong>Carlisle, </strong>who have loaned the defender Fin Back, son of the former England rugby union flanker Neil, from Nottingham Forest, appear light on quality up front and <strong>Harrogate</strong>, who only managed three wins from their final 15 matches last season, limped over the line with a dreadful defensive record. <strong>Colchester</strong> pulled clear but nothing suggests they will be better this time. It is all change at <strong>Rochdale</strong> – seven of their starting XI from the final day of last season have departed – and they will have to lean on experience if they are to stay afloat, with Ian Henderson, 37, returning for a swansong.</p> <p>It is hard to know what to expect at <strong>Hartlepool</strong>, 17th last season, but Paul Hartley, a classy midfielder in his playing days, enjoyed some success in Scotland as manager at Cove Rangers and has brought in several signings from north of the border. Under new local-boys-made-good owners and a familiar face in Paul Hurst, <strong>Grimsby</strong> need not fret about survival and should feel inspired by <strong>Sutton United</strong>,<strong> </strong>whose first campaign in the Football League was a resounding triumph. Matt Gray led his team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/rotherham-sutton-united-papa-johns-trophy-final-match-report-wembley\">to the final of the EFL Trophy</a> and within a point of the playoffs, but they are short on goals and while replicating that showing looks tricky, they should have enough to steer clear of trouble.</p> <h2>Three youngsters to watch</h2> <p><strong>Kyle Hudlin, 22, AFC Wimbledon </strong>Thought to be the tallest outfield player in Britain, the 6ft 9in Hudlin promises to be a handful during his year-long loan spell at AFC Wimbledon. The striker joined Huddersfield in the summer from Solihull Moors, for whom he scored four league goals in the National League last season. Another Huddersfield youngster, Kian Harratt, who scored in the playoff final for Port Vale last season, could shine for Bradford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a41761b3aeefb7eb2098e40d3677d971246970d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a41761b3aeefb7eb2098e40d3677d971246970d/0_119_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Hudlin playing for Solihull Moors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Hudlin is expected to shine up front for AFC Wimbledon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Bardens/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Zac Williams, 18, Crewe </strong>The Wales Under-19s defender, who cites Joe Rodon as an inspiration, is perhaps the most exciting of another talented batch of youngsters at Crewe. Was given Jaffa Cakes and a packet of crisps after his man-of-the-match display against Gillingham in November because he was too young for a bottle of champagne and signed a new deal in May. </p> <p><strong>Liam Bennett, 20, Walsall</strong> An energetic and tenacious full-back, Bennett will spend the season on loan at Walsall from Cambridge. Bennett, who was on loan at Hemel Hempstead last campaign, excelled against Aston Villa in pre-season and his appetite to make things happen endears him to supporters. “He would tackle a bus if it was moving,” said the Cambridge head coach Mark Bonner in January.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-66-kate-bush","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Wuthering Heights and Lionhearts – take the Thursday quiz Kate Bush special","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-66-kate-bush","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-66-kate-bush","fields":{"headline":"Wuthering Heights and Lionhearts – take the Thursday quiz Kate Bush special","trailText":"Fifteen questions on general knowledge and topical trivia plus a few jokes every Thursday – how will you fare?","byline":"Martin Belam","body":"<p>It is Kate Bush’s birthday on Saturday, and so we have an exciting new one-off Thursday quiz format in her honour!

In the song, Babooshka is the pen name of a wife sending racy notes to her husband to test his fidelity. Kate said in an interview once that she hadn't realised бaбушка (babushka) is actually the Russian word for 'grandmother' which is … less sexy., 3:B - An An was 35, the equivalent of 105 years for humans. He was born in the wild in the south-western Chinese province of Sichuan, but his health had been showing signs of deterioration over the past few weeks., 4:A - He was besieging a castle when he was wounded by the crossbow bolt. The wound then got infected and did for him. Some contemporary sources say the boy who fired the bolt was brought before Richard, forgiven by the monarch and given 100 shillings. Other sources suggest that, as soon as Richard I passed away, the boy was then flayed alive for killing the king by somewhat less forgiving members of Richard's entourage., 5:C - Eight wild cats from Namibia will roam freely at Kuno-Palpur national park in the state of Madhya Pradesh in efforts to reintroduce the animals to their natural habitat. Despite being a vital part of India’s ecosystem, the cheetah was declared extinct from the country in 1952 because of habitat loss and poaching., 6:C - One Indian Rupee is worth a little over one penny – or at least it was on 21 July when this question was written, so £10 will buy just under 1,000 rupees., 7:A - The state line between California and Nevada actually runs through the middle of the lake, which is one of the largest bodies of freshwater on the North American continent. It is renowned for winter sports, and also ghostly dogs., 8:B - Barrie invented the character at the turn of the 20th century, about a load of lost children fighting pirates for no readily apparent reason., 9:B - All of these actors appeared in Hammer Horror movies, but Lee specialised in portraying Dracula, often opposite Cushing as Doctor Van Helsing. Hammer Horror was a rare flop for Kate Bush in her early career, with the single failing to reach the top 40., 10:D - That's the ticket. In the song π Bush sings the number to its 78th decimal place, then from its 101st to its 137th decimal place., 11:A - She was put on trial by a pro-English church court overseen by English commanders at Rouen, Normandy in 1431. The court found her guilty of heresy and she was burned at the stake. She was made a saint in 1920. That picture is Maria Falconetti in 1928 movie The Passion of Joan of Arc., 12:B - Having invented it over the previous few years, Sax got a patent for 14 versions of the honking squawking things in various different sizes., 13:C - The Tigris runs through the city – the Euphrates is close and runs parallel to the Tigris at this point, but is to the southwest., 14:C - It was Emily who wrote the unhappy history of the Earnshaws and the Lintons, a book which the quiz master has attempted to read on three separate occasions but always given up on because dear lord they are a bunch of miserabalists in that novel, eh? That picture, by the way, is from The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever flash mob at Edinburgh Gardens in Melbourne in 2019, and they are all dressed how Kate appeared in one of the videos for the song., 15:B - Regular readers of the Thursday Quiz may be familiar with the 44-year gap between her first No 1 single, Wuthering Heights, and her second No 1 single, Running Up The Hill, which hit the top spot this year. Happy birthday Kate! For viewers in the UK, BBC Two has a special night of Kate Bush programmes on Saturday evening.

In 1985, the US supreme court <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fires-pittsburgh-us-news-il-state-wire-shootings-fb33a7eb824b47c492f01130c73878eb\">ruled</a> that officers can use lethal force against a fleeing person only if they reasonably believed that person was an imminent threat. But the court later said that an officer’s state of mind and fear in the moment was relevant to determining whether the shooting was warranted. That means a killing could be considered justified if the officer claimed he feared the person was armed or saw them gesturing toward their waistband – even if it turned out the victim was unarmed and the threat was nonexistent.</p> <p>As a result, very few police officers get charged. Adante Pointer, a civil rights lawyer, said it was not hard for officers to prevail when the case boiled down to what was going through the minds of the officer and victim in the moment: “The only person left to tell the story is the cop.”</p> <p>In 2022 through mid-July, officers have killed 633 people, including 202 who were fleeing. In 2021, 368 victims were fleeing (32% of all killings); in 2020, 380 were fleeing (33%); and in 2019, 325 were fleeing (30%), according to Mapping Police Violence. The data is based on media reports of people who were trying to escape when they were killed, and it is considered incomplete. In roughly 10% to 20% of all cases each year, the circumstances surrounding the shootings are unclear.</p> <p>Black Americans are disproportionately affected, making up 32% of individuals killed by police while fleeing, but only accounting for 13% of the US population. Black victims were even more overrepresented in cases involving people fleeing on foot, making up 35% to 54% of those fatalities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/02-race/giv-6562WpjjxOCNnBbs/\" data-alt=\"Black Americans are disproportionately killed while fleeing in the US. \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/02-race/giv-6562WpjjxOCNnBbs/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“If a person is running away, there is no reason to chase them, hunt them down like an animal and shoot and kill them,” said Paula McGowan, whose son,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/vallejo-police-shooting-bike-ronell-foster-willie-mccoy\"> Ronell Foster</a>, was killed while fleeing in Vallejo, California, in February 2018. The officer, Ryan McMahon, said he was trying to stop Foster, a 33-year-old father of two, because he was riding his bike without a light. Within roughly one minute of trying to stop him, the officer engaged in a struggle and shot Foster in the back of the head. Officials later claimed that the unarmed man had grabbed his flashlight and presented it “in a threatening manner”.</p> <p>“These officers are too amped up and ready to shoot,” said McGowan, who for years advocated that the officer be fired and prosecuted. Instead, the officer went on to shoot another Black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/the-life-and-death-of-rapper-willie-mccoy-executed-by-police\">Willie McCoy</a>, one year later; he was one of six officers who fatally shot the 20-year-old who had been sleeping in his car. The officer was terminated in 2020 – not for killing McCoy or Foster, but because the department said he put other officers in danger during the shooting of McCoy.</p> <p>The city paid Foster’s family $5.7m in a civil <a href=\"https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/5-7-million-settlement-reached-in-2018-vallejo-police-shooting-death-of-ronell-foster/\">settlement</a> in 2020, but did not admit wrongdoing. A lawyer for McMahon previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/19/us-police-shootings-george-floyd-press-releases-reports\">said</a> the officer was attempting to “simply talk to Mr Foster” when he fled, adding that McMahon “believed his actions were reasonable under the circumstances”.<strong> </strong>Vallejo police did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>“Not only do these officers get away with it, they get to move on to bigger and better jobs while we’re left shattered and are still trying to pick up the pieces,” said Miguel Minjares, whose niece, 16-year-old Elena “Ebbie” Mondragon, was killed by Fremont, California, police.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e20011178cd6703813b4cbd02fedc33e128cb6b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e20011178cd6703813b4cbd02fedc33e128cb6b2/0_0_642_591/500.jpg\" alt=\"Selfie of a woman pouting into the camera.\" width=\"500\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elena “Ebbie” Mondragon was killed by Fremont police in March 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Miguel Minjares</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In March 2017, undercover officers fired at a car that was fleeing, striking Mondragon, who was a passenger and pregnant at the time. The officers faced no criminal consequences. One sergeant went on to work as a sniper for the department, though has since retired, and another involved in the operation continued working as a training officer, records show.</p> <p>“You shoot into a moving car, which you shouldn’t have done, and you weren’t even close to hitting the person you were trying to target. And now you’re a sniper?” said Minjares. “When I hear sniper, I think of precision. It boggles my mind. It shows the entitlement of officers and the police department – they just put people where they want them, it doesn’t matter what they did. It’s confusing and it’s heart wrenching.”</p> <p>In June, five years after the killing, the family won $21m in a civil trial, but it’s unclear if Fremont has changed any of its policies or practices.</p> <p>A Fremont spokesperson declined to comment on the Mondragon case and did not respond to questions about its policies.</p> <h2>The push to prevent the killings</h2> <p>In the rare cases when prosecutors do file criminal charges against police who killed fleeing people, the process often takes years and typically concludes with victory for the officer, either with judges or prosecutors themselves dismissing the charges with or jury acquittals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6206d00792fa939ea5c8c4f9717273e2c27b52de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6206d00792fa939ea5c8c4f9717273e2c27b52de/0_0_720_558/500.jpg\" alt=\"A young man wearing dark blue graduation robes poses on the street.\" width=\"500\" height=\"388\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Adams, 23, was fatally shot by police as he ran away.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In one Florida case where an officer was investigating a shoplifting and fatally shot a man fleeing in a van, prosecutors filed charges and then <a href=\"https://www.clickorlando.com/news/2019/09/12/orlando-police-release-statement-after-manslaughter-charge-dropped-against-officer/\">dropped the case</a> a week later, saying that after a review of evidence, it “became apparent it would be incredibly difficult to obtain a conviction”. In a Hawaii case where officers killed a 16-year-old in a car, a judge last year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/08/20/1029620496/3-honolulu-police-officers-fatally-shot-teen-trial-iremamber-sykap\">rejected</a> all charges and prevented the case from going to trial.</p> <p>For the nine fleeing cases where officers were found guilty or signed a plea deal, the conviction and sentence were much lighter than in typical homicides.

A San Diego sheriff’s deputy pleaded guilty earlier this year to voluntary manslaughter after he killed a fleeing man, but he avoided state prison, instead getting <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-02-07/former-san-diego-deputy-sentenced-to-probation-jail-in-killing-of-fleeing-man\">one year in jail</a>.

There has also been a growing effort to ban officers from shooting at moving cars.</p> <p>California passed a law in 2019 meant to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/california-use-of-force-law-stephon-clark\">restrict use of deadly force</a> to cases when it was “necessary” to defend human life, not just “reasonable”. The law stated that an officer can kill a fleeing person only if they believe that person is going to imminently harm someone. The new law also dictated that prosecutors must consider the officer’s actions leading up to the killing, which police groups had argued<strong> </strong>were irrelevant under the previous standards.</p> <p>But after its passage, police departments across the state refused to comply and update their policies, said Adrienna Wong, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of southern California, which backed the bill. That’s only now starting to change after years of legal disputes.</p> <p>“I think we’re going to start to see prosecutors consider all the elements of the new law, but I’m frankly not holding my breath based on the track record of prosecutors in the state.

But not so long ago, a woman was a startling rarity on an instrument whose evolution in modern music, from the 1920s onwards, had been almost exclusively driven by men. Barbara Thompson, who has died aged 77 of Parkinson’s disease, was one of the most inspirational exceptions.</p> <p>Thompson’s formidable instrumental skills encompassed a tenor-saxophone voice that could range from the sensuous lyricism of Coleman Hawkins or Stan Getz to the power of John Coltrane’s turbulent soliloquies; nimble bebop fluency on the alto sax; and a dulcet-to-abstract tonal range on the flute. As a prolific composer, she wrote classical concertos and choral works, TV themes (including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvdtOZyl2I\" title=\"\">A Touch of Frost</a>) and settings for poetry. She made friends and fans all over Europe (particularly in Germany), and across generations. The composer and trumpeter Yazz Ahmed, as part of her Polyhymnia project for International Women’s Day in 2015, composed a suite simply entitled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWUm9YCmjfU\" title=\"\">Barbara</a> in tribute to her formidable elder’s work and influence.</p> <p>Barbara was born in Oxford, to Dick Thompson, later registrar of the court of criminal appeal, and Joan (nee Gracey), who had been a fellow Oxford University student before their marriage. The child was raised in London, first at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and then in Notting Hill, where she attended the Fox primary school, and learned to play the recorder. Her parents separated when Barbara was six, and her refuge from loss and conflict was to study the fine details of musicmaking for hours.</p> <p>At Queen’s College school in Harley Street (1955-62), she learned the clarinet and piano, and played for five years in the London Schools Symphony Orchestra. Then she spent a season with the Ivy Benson All Girl Band, having taken up the alto saxophone on hearing Johnny Hodges playing with Duke Ellington. At the Royal College of Music (1962-65), she studied the flute, piano, clarinet and composition while also taking private saxophone lessons.</p> <p>In 1965, Thompson joined the New Jazz Orchestra (NJO), an adventurous big band led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/04/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Neil Ardley</a>, and formed the previous year at the Green Man pub in Blackheath. Her jazz experience was still limited, but she learned fast and enthusiastically, especially in contact with the new music of such original local composers as Ardley, Michael Gibbs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/15/michael-garrick\" title=\"\">Michael Garrick</a>. Thompson and the NJO drummer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/18/jon-hiseman-obituary\" title=\"\">Jon Hiseman</a>, began a relationship that became a marriage in 1967.</p> <p>Thompson’s career gained momentum, both as a composer (her first published piece, for flute and piano, was written while she was still at college), and as a freelance. Between 1967 and 1971, she played in the all-female group She Trinity (playing the hefty baritone sax with them as the support act on some gigs by the Who), co-led a quintet with the saxophonist Art Themen, and worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/07/sir-john-dankworth-obituary\" title=\"\">John Dankworth</a> and Cleo Laine, Gibbs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/29/don-rendell\" title=\"\">Don Rendell</a>. In 1972, Thompson formed the genre-splicing band Paraphernalia, with Hiseman joining later in the decade – changing incarnations of the group would continue as a vehicle for her composing for the next 40 years.</p> <p>Thompson played saxes and flute alongside Hiseman’s jazz-rock quintet, Colosseum, on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1978 classical crossover album Variations, and she subsequently collaborated with Lloyd Webber on the musicals Cats and Starlight Express. From 1973 until 1980, she led Jubiaba, a nine-piece Latin-jazz group, and in the late 80s launched the big band Moving Parts. Throughout these years, she was also regularly a member of the international United Jazz and Rock Ensemble, a powerful outfit with a Europe-wide audience, and a lineup including the UK trumpeters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/28/obituary-ian-carr-jazz\" title=\"\">Ian Carr</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/19/kenny-wheeler\" title=\"\">Kenny Wheeler</a>, the German trombonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/28/guardianobituaries.arts\" title=\"\">Albert Mangelsdorff</a>, and the US saxist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/25/obtiuary-charlie-mariano\" title=\"\">Charlie Mariano</a>.</p> <p>In 1992, to mark European Union Year, Thompson formed the all-acoustic sextet Sans Frontiers, which featured the Italian trumpet star Enrico Rava and the Polish violinist Michael Urbaniak.</p> <p>She was appointed MBE in 1996. The following year, following concerns about her fingering, she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. She continued to work, tour and record for the next four years, but was eventually forced to retire from active performance. In 2001, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/apr/01/featuresreview.review5\" title=\"\">told the Observer jazz writer Dave Gelly</a> that, although medication could probably help her through a few years more: “I won’t play below my best.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06bf052720c2ce44187bfac8b18420bc564e24e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06bf052720c2ce44187bfac8b18420bc564e24e9/555_506_3028_3785/800.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Thompson in 1967, when it was a startling rarity for a woman to play saxophone\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Thompson in 1967, when it was a startling rarity for a woman to play saxophone</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Norman Potter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But medication improved, and Thompson did return to the stage for a 2003 tour with Colosseum, and for Paraphernalia gigs in Europe in 2005, recorded as Paraphernalia Live ’05. In 2007, she and Hiseman released the studio album Never Say Goodbye. By the end of the decade, Thompson was working on a piano concerto, the four-movement Quantum Leaps suite for the flautist Shona Brown, and the single-movement Perpetual Motion, for a 12-piece saxophone ensemble, and more. A BBC documentary directed by Mike Dibb, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIVKYkvhUXg\" title=\"\">Playing Against Time</a>, a sensitive study five years in the making and released in 2011, portrayed Thompson’s artistic and physical battles.</p> <p>Thompson contributed to Colosseum’s swansong album, Time on Our Side, and toured again with the band in 2015. She finished work on Paraphernalia’s eclectic final album, The Last Fandango, with the Apollo Saxophone Quartet and Shona Brown guesting, and her own lyrically shapely and storytelling improv muse on both soprano and tenor saxes. </p> <p>In 2018 Hiseman died following surgery to remove a brain tumour. Thompson witnessed a heartfelt celebration of the couple’s achievements at Shepherd’s Bush Empire the following year, featuring members of Paraphernalia and Colosseum, and their daughter, Anna (the singer-songwriter Ana Gracey). The National Youth Jazz Orchestra’s collaboration with the remaining active players of Paraphernalia on 10 Thompson originals was released in 2021 as the studio album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/12/barbara-thompsons-paraphernalia-with-nyjo-bulletproof-review-fresh-takes-on-old-favourites\" title=\"\">Bulletproof</a>.</p> <p>Thompson is survived by her children, Marcus and Anna, and by two siblings, Hugh and Jane.</p> <p> • Barbara Gracey Thompson, saxophonist and composer, born 27 July 1944; died 9 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/28/labour-party-cost-of-living-keir-starmer-striking-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T09:37:53Z","webTitle":"What has happened to the Labour party that it can't stand up for labour? | John McDonnell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/labour-party-cost-of-living-keir-starmer-striking-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/labour-party-cost-of-living-keir-starmer-striking-workers","fields":{"headline":"What has happened to the Labour party that it can’t stand up for labour?","trailText":"With the cost of living crisis hitting millions, Keir Starmer will pay an electoral price for his failure to support striking workers, says former shadow chancellor John McDonnell","byline":"John McDonnell","body":"<p>It was 1977. I was in my mid-20s and had just moved down from the north to west London. A group of Asian women working at a film-developing factory in Brent had started a strike for better pay and working conditions. Trade union branches across London and my local constituency Labour party in Hayes were sending delegations to join the women in their saris on the picket lines. This was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/dec/27/jayaben-desai-dies-aged-77\">the historic Grunwick strike</a>, led by the now famous, heroic Jayaben Desai.</p> <p>I went with our CLP delegation regularly. It was a tough and, at times, violent dispute as the police escorted a bus full of scabs brought in by the company to break the strike and teach the women a lesson.</p> <p>The Labour and trade union movement came together as one to campaign against the exploitation of these women. Joining the picket lines to show solidarity were some of the most prominent members of the movement, and among those who joined the women’s picket line were Labour cabinet ministers. Not shadow ministers but cabinet ministers actually serving in government at the time, including, famously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/28/past.politics4\">Shirley Williams</a>.</p> <p>Labour MPs joining picket lines was not exceptional; it was expected of them. The trade union movement had founded the Labour party to serve as the voice of labour in parliament. To be a Labour party member in those days, you had to demonstrate that you were a trade union member and what trade union members do is support one another. There was no exemption from the basic duty to show solidarity just because party members and trade unionists had selected you to be an MP and serve the movement as a minister or shadow minister.</p> <p>So how is it that we have arrived at a situation where a Labour leader is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/20/keir-starmer-tells-labour-frontbench-they-should-not-join-rail-strike-pickets\">instructing shadow ministers</a> not to attend picket lines and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/sam-tarry-sacked-labour-frontbench-rail-strike-picket-line-keir-starmer\">sacked a shadow minister</a>, Sam Tarry, seemingly<strong> </strong>for doing so?</p> <p>The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/20/forde-report-labour-factionalism\">Forde report</a> into the operation of the Labour party spends considerable time exploring what it described as the culture of the party. The report exposes just how far the party has travelled from its original ethos. The Labour family survived, and at times thrived, by accepting it was a broad church of political views, upholding a mutual respect for those differing views and, above all else embracing, at its heart, solidarity.</p> <p>But the clique of advisers that now surrounds Keir Starmer and appears to control the party seems drunk on its own power and to have lost all appreciation of the party’s traditions of mutual respect and solidarity.</p> <p>It’s not hard to imagine the line of thought of those advising Starmer on the strikes: it’s political painting by numbers. The focus groups don’t like strikes. They will blame the unions and anyone who supports them for the disruption caused, egged on by a rising tide of abuse in the rightwing media. So the advice to the leader will be keep away from any association with the unions at all costs.</p> <p>Crass decisions are then made not to back our unions in disputes, no matter how just their cause, then to order shadow ministers not to join picket lines no matter what their membership or association with the union in dispute. This isn’t just a complete misreading of the mood within the Labour and trade union movement but also among the general public.</p> <p>The anger at Starmer’s actions among trade unions is palpable. This may not matter to the leader’s team when the Tories are so helpfully self-immolating, but when times get tougher and the trade union cavalry is needed to save the leader, they may remember who was and who wasn’t on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/21/hot-strike-summer-britain-unions-spiralling-inflation\">this summer’s picket lines</a>.</p> <p>In terms of the general public, the reason that there is an unprecedented level of sympathy for these strikes is not just down to the impressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/23/mick-lynch-media-star-labour-rmt-leader-union-boss\">straight-talking eloquence</a> of the RMT’s Mick Lynch. It’s because millions are being hit by the same cost of living crisis, which has become the key mobilising factor in the massive wave of industrial disputes that is currently building.</p> <p>The risk is that when the millions involved go to the polls next, they will be asking the question of the Labour leader, where were you when we needed you? Whatever diktats from the Labour leader’s office, there is a weightier responsibility on the shoulders of Labour members, whatever position they hold. It is to stand up for one another in the Labour and trade union movement in this summer of solidarity.</p> <ul> <li><p>John McDonnell is the Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington.

In the UK, meanwhile, Break My Soul currently sits at No 4, marking her first foray into the Top 10 since 2013’s Drunk in Love.</p> <p>“Break My Soul is one of the most commercial things she’s released in quite some time,” says Christopher Molanphy, US chart analyst and pop critic. “What was interesting about Beyoncé in the 2010s was that as omnipresent as she was in popular culture, she was not a traditional hitmaker.

In <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cfb3ddsFe2S/?hl=en\">a relatively lengthy Instagram post</a> announcing Renaissance – itself a rarity – she referred to it as “a place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking”, marking a clear shift in her attitude towards her work: it was only in 2013 that she released a single called Flawless. “She has had to focus on perfection to get to where she is,” says Mokoena. “Now that she’s entered this deity-like position in pop culture, she can do as she pleases.”</p> <p>Shedding old behaviours also chimes with the current post-lockdown climate. “Her choosing to anchor this album as a release through dance music, of throwing your inhibitions away, might be her way of responding [to the pandemic],” says Mokoena.</p> <p>This sense of freedom also applies to her role as curator, with Renaissance bringing new collaborators to her usual cohort of co-writers and co-producers. In addition to Pharrell Williams and The-Dream, there are also alt-pop outliers such as PC Music’s AG Cook and Grimes collaborator BloodPop. She also shines a light on the often unheralded Black female pioneers of dance music such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/24/dj-honey-dijon-dancefloors-do-what-religions-and-governments-cant\">Honey Dijon</a> or Grace Jones.</p> <p>“Beyoncé moves with intention,” says <a href=\"https://www.taylorcrumpton.com/\">Taylor Crumpton</a>, a music, pop culture and politics journalist from Dallas, Texas, who sees the inclusion of Dijon and Jones as a way of showcasing the “architects of a sound that is historically coded as white. I think of Beyoncé more now as a historian than a musician. She is finding the people who have created these sounds.”</p> <p>That said, Jones’s involvement on the track Move is something of a surprise after she seemed to dismiss Beyoncé as a passing trend in her 2015 autobiography, I’ll Never Write My Memoirs. “Beyoncé is a student of music – she knows you can’t make a dance album without Grace Jones,” says Crumpton.</p> <p>Beyoncé’s rewriting of the rules around how to release albums also coincided with her stepping away from revealing anything about herself in interviews: that Vogue appearance was noticeably skimpy on the details.</p> <p>Instead, each record has offered fans a tantalising peek inside her world, whether it be exalting married life on 2013’s self-titled album, or laying bare Jay-Z’s infidelity on follow-up Lemonade. Her silence outside music may be a way of keeping the focus on her as musician, itself a hard fought battle in the pop industry, not least for a Black woman.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/how-neighbours-gave-me-a-deep-australian-kink","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T09:00:30Z","webTitle":"Reader, I married one – and moved there.

How Neighbours gave me a deep Australian kink","trailText":"To a teenager in Lincolnshire, Erinsborough seemed like a wonderful, bright and sexy place – and it opened up the world to me","byline":"Rae Earl","body":"<p>And there I was … sobbing at a wedding dress in a museum in Hobart, Tasmania. I hate weddings. By all means, plan your big day, create your mood board and do the princess thing. I was married in a five-minute ceremony, wearing a Stetson, before heading to the pub. Fancy nuptials leave me cold. This wasn’t just any wedding outfit, though. This was the meringue that I believe sealed my destiny.</p> <p>It was Charlene’s wedding dress from Neighbours. Backlit and plumped up in a corner while the classic Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan episode played in the background. The object of my pilgrimage, resplendent in all its glory, was available to view for one month only. High neck. <em>Huge</em> sleeves. Lace. Roses. Ruffles. A frou-frou masterpiece that can whisk middle-aged Britons back to November 1988. School. Lincolnshire. Where the wonderful Mrs Russell let us watch the ceremony at lunchtime on the telly in the sixth form centre. She understood the gravitas of the situation; this wasn’t just family getting married. This was our royalty. The wedding of the century.</p> <p>For much of Britain, what even <em>was</em> Australia before Neighbours? A galaxy far, far away that people disappeared to, like the two ginger-haired boys from Doughty Street in my home town in the 70s. The revelation “We are moving to Perth” was greeted with sharp intakes of breath and a hesitant, loaded: “All the very best with <em>that</em>!” It was a place that featured with terrifying frequency on the reunion segment of Surprise Surprise – the big finale where Cilla Black would tell some bewildered pensioner that her sister from Brisbane, who she hadn’t seen for 37 years, was about to come on stage. Australia was further away than the moon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"945eecc2d1de0fe53c35ac30ba54b0c8cb4c44b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/945eecc2d1de0fe53c35ac30ba54b0c8cb4c44b5/0_163_3392_2036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Jones as Jane Harris kisses a topless Guy Pearce as Mike Young in Neighbours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Jones as Jane Harris and Guy Pearce as Mike Young in Neighbours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fremantle Media/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, we’d had their soaps before – the theme tune from Sons and Daughters was practically our soundtrack to skiving off school – but we’d never seen <em>this</em> Australia before. Neighbours reset it all. It was so bright. It had cafes, hangouts and HSCs (higher school certificates). They seemed so much sexier than GCSEs. And, if you failed them, you could just start your own chauffeuring business. Whenever I’m in Melbourne and I see a green car, I wonder if Helen Daniels’ “Home James” service is still operating.</p> <p>Moreover, Neighbours had teenagers who argued with their parents and then went out and had fun. No moping around Albert Square meeting up with the secret father of your baby, Michelle Fowler style. Young Australians went to the <em>beach</em>. It was an odd place, without a pier, donkeys or fruit machines, but it looked amazing. Zero sharks and lots of splashing about with hot boys.</p> <p>And here was the real attraction: Australian men. Scott/Jason. They were interchangeable to me. Not the gauche Foster-swigging Paul Hogan stereotype of Australian men. Scott/Jason was supportive of Charlene/Kylie’s effortlessly feminist mechanic ambitions. Then there was sensitive grafter Mike/Guy Pearce, who ended up dating Plain Jane “Super Brain” Harris. What is this wonderful world? It’s a country where geeks can score a hot guy and working-class people can have detached houses with big yards. It’s a country where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/bouncers-dream-and-gorillagrams-an-oral-history-of-neighbours-the-worlds-silliest-sunniest-show\" title=\"\">even labradors can dare to dream</a>.</p> <p>But, like Bouncer’s nocturnal hallucinations, it was all fantasy. Back then, I had no desire to live abroad. With my teenage panic attacks, Peterborough was as far as I could get. But, somewhere within me, a seed must have been sown. The media in the 90s was littered with Australians. They were everywhere. I was friends with lots of them; I married one. After a decade of living in the UK, he said: “Why don’t we live <em>there</em> for a bit?” It was terrifying. But Skype had arrived: you could now actually see people that were far away. And the echoes of Erinsborough were in my brain.</p> <p>Neighbours became, in my mind, the pseudo-documentary on which I based one of the key decisions of my life. It would all be OK. Madge. Jim. Clive. Helen. I just had to avoid cliffs. “Harrrrrrrolllllddddd!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b13f0f05447dbaaba78bc825e1caa35db871f036\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b13f0f05447dbaaba78bc825e1caa35db871f036/11_265_694_931/373.jpg\" alt=\"Rae Earl’s partner in the 1980s.\" width=\"373\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The look of the Donovans … Rae Earl’s partner in the 1980s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we prepared for the move, I sorted through some of my partner’s old Polaroids from the 80s. He looked, I realised, like an extra from Lassiter’s coffee shop. When I recently shared the photo on Facebook, I embellished the post with what I thought was an obvious lie: “He had been in the soap for seven episodes as waiter Jason Byrne in Mr Udagawa’s hotel complex.” Despite the ludicrousness of the claim, some of my friends believed it. He did have the look of the Donovans about him. Neighbours, it seems, gave me a deep Australian kink. And I didn’t even know it.</p> <p>Life tumbles on. Living here for “a bit” has turned into more than a decade. Rarely do you see your life as a complete series – more like chapters and episodes. However, in that one wedding dress, I saw my trajectory from teen to 50. From that mad, fat adolescent who couldn’t go anywhere to a functioning adult … on a bloody island near Antarctica.</p> <p>At the time of writing, Charlene’s dress is about to be packed away safely in a box at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. I have no idea what it will mean to future generations, but I suspect Minogue’s endless and joyful reincarnations will ensure its relevance. For me, it will always be more than a dress. So much more than a symbol of romance. By the time you get to a half-century, you know the limitations of that. And yes, I am still married to my brilliant Aussie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/25/how-well-do-you-know-ramsay-street-its-the-ultimate-neighbours-quiz\">How well do you know Ramsay Street?

Their wedding – along with all the 80s frills Minogue wore – is a reminder of when I needed to believe there was something else. A bigger, better future that, at that time and in that mental state, I couldn’t quite conceive of. I still have days like that, wherever I am in the world. Don’t we all? That’s when a good dose of frothy soap can make all the difference. Onya Neighbours.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/28/tory-candidates-tax-plans-liz-truss-rishi-sunak","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T09:00:30Z","webTitle":"The difference between the Tory candidates’ tax plans?

Truss’s proposal does little for those who need it, and Sunak’s is a desperate U-turn, says Larry Elliott, the Guardian’s economics editor","byline":"Larry Elliott","body":"<p>Rishi Sunak is losing the battle to be Britain’s next prime minister and he knows it. The former chancellor’s announcement that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/rishi-sunak-vat-energy-bills-screeching-u-turn-kwasi-kwarteng-liz-truss\">scrap VAT</a> on energy bills for a year is exactly what it looks like: a U-turn born of desperation.</p> <p>Having set himself up as the candidate of sober rectitude, Sunak has bowed to the inevitable as opinion polls show Liz Truss’s plan for immediate tax cuts are proving more attractive to Conservative party members than his wait-and-see approach.</p> <p>Let’s be clear. Judging by their campaigns so far, neither Sunak nor Truss have the first idea of what to do about the UK’s deep-seated economic problems. But Truss – more by luck than judgment perhaps – is on to something when she says Sunak’s previous tax decisions are making a bad situation worse.</p> <p>Some economists think Britain is already in recession, others that the country is still teetering on the brink. One thing is certain: the decision by Gazprom to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/25/russias-gazprom-to-make-drastic-cut-to-europes-gas-supply-from-wednesday\">restrict supplies of gas</a> to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has amplified that threat. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said this week that a sudden stop to Russian energy was one of the things that could turn a marked slowdown in the global economy into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/26/imf-slashes-global-growth-forecast-as-top-three-economies-stall\">something a lot more serious</a>. That recession risk seems to be materialising, and although Britain is not dependent on Russian gas it will still be affected by surging global gas prices.</p> <p>It now looks as though the energy price cap will increase from just under £2,000 a year to at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/08/uk-energy-bills-rise-winter-energy-price-cap\">£3,300 a year</a> – and perhaps even higher – in October, pushing the annual inflation rate well into double figures. The IMF already expects the UK economy to have stalled by the end of this year and to be the slowest growing of the G7 group of major industrial nations in 2023.</p> <p>Higher inflation is bound to trigger a response from the Bank of England. Interest rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/16/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-125-to-tackle-inflation\">have been raised</a> at the last five meetings of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) and official borrowing costs will go up again next week. Up until now the MPC has preferred cautious 0.25 percentage point increases but there is every chance of a 0.5-point jump this time. The chances of overkill are high because the Bank will continue tightening policy until it is sure higher prices are not feeding through into higher pay deals and inflation is heading back towards its 2% target.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Treasury’s obsession with balancing the books means it too is bearing down on growth. National insurance contributions (NIC) went up in April, income tax thresholds are being frozen for three years and corporation tax will be raised from 19% to 25% next year. As a share of the economy, taxes this year will be at their highest since 1950-1.</p> <p>The risk here is obvious. If the Bank of England is sucking spending power out of the economy through higher interest rates at the same time as the Treasury is doing the same through higher taxes, then the chances of recession increase, especially when the economy is already weakening.</p> <p>Sunak has put forward two reasons to justify his tax increases. The first is that the high levels of debt and borrowing mean the UK has maxed out on its credit card. This, though, suggests that there is no difference between the finances of a household and the finances of the state, when that is not the case. States that can print their own currency do not go bust. There is no such thing as the nation’s credit card and it makes sense for the government to spend more when the rest of the economy is weak.</p> <p>The second argument is that Truss’s proposed tax cuts – the reversal of the NIC increase and the scrapping of the proposed corporation tax rise – would lead to even greater inflationary pressure and hence significantly higher interest rates from the Bank of England.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/26/labour-cautious-public-ownership\">Labour is being too cautious on public ownership - it’s pragmatic policy | Cat Hobbs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This doesn’t really stand up to serious scrutiny either. Truss’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/23/thatcher-ministers-liz-truss-tax-cut-plans-patten-lamont-rifkind\">£30bn package</a> is relatively small beer in the context of a £2tn-plus economy, and more than half the cost would come from not going ahead with the corporation tax increase. The boost to consumer spending potential would be modest and even under Prime Minister Truss taxes would still be at a 70-year high. Interest rates may be a bit higher than they would otherwise be.</p> <p>A better critique of the Truss tax plan is that it does very little for the people who are being hit hardest by spiralling energy costs. As the Resolution Foundation has pointed out, only <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/talking-tax/\">15% of the benefits</a> of reversing the NICs increase would go to the poorer half of the population against 28% going to the richest 20%. The average boost to incomes in London would be more than double that in the north-east of England or Wales.</p> <p>Clearly, there is no way in which their proposed tax cuts – whether now or later – are a solution to a worsening cost of living crisis and more help is going to be needed to help households through the winter. It would make more sense to target support at those who need it most through the benefits system rather than provide tax cuts that favour the better off.</p> <p>That, though, is not the choice being presented to those handed the task of picking Boris Johnson’s successor. They are being given the choice between Truss’s bad plan and Sunak’s really bad plan. As things stand, they look like opting for the former.</p> <ul> <li><p>Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-fire-barrage-missiles-northern-ukraine-from-belarus","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T08:56:56Z","webTitle":" Russian forces fire barrage of missiles at northern Ukraine from Belarus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-fire-barrage-missiles-northern-ukraine-from-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-fire-barrage-missiles-northern-ukraine-from-belarus","fields":{"headline":" Russian forces fire barrage of missiles at northern Ukraine from Belarus","trailText":"Strikes hit Chernihiv region as well as locations outside Kyiv and around city of Zhytomyr, say officials","byline":"Peter Beaumont in Kyiv","body":"<p>A barrage of 25 missiles has been fired by Russian forces at northern regions of Ukraine from neighbouring Belarus as the Ukrainian southern offensive appears to be gathering pace.</p> <p>The early morning wave of missile strikes launched from the territory of Russia’s key ally hit targets in the Chernihiv region, including an apartment block, as well as locations outside Kyiv and around the city of Zhytomyr, according to Ukrainian officials and Belarusian opposition figures.</p> <p>The Chernihiv regional governor, Viacheslav Chaus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-kyiv-region-hit-by-rocket-attack-governor-says-fight-to-liberate-kherson-has-begun-ukraine-claims?page=with:block-62e21d1d8f08ecc573bc1175#block-62e21d1d8f08ecc573bc1175\">said nine missiles had struck</a> close to the village of Honcharivska with some falling in the forest nearby.</p> <p>The strikes came as Ukraine celebrated Statehood Day for the first time.

It’s overdue and expected to be tabled next week, and will outline just how tricky it will be to deliver the 450GL. </p> \n  <p>That water is often referred to as water for South Australia, because it’s critical to the health of that end of the river system. But it’s important to point out that the system works as a whole, and if there isn’t enough environmental water, the whole system suffers – and that includes habitats and species. </p> \n  <p> Plibersek was emphatic about the federal government’s intention to deliver the 450GL, but she’s also pretty upfront that it’s going to be hard to meet the 2024 deadline. </p> \n  <p> Earlier today she said all options (including potentially stretching that deadline) were on the table. She told Sky News:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It’s an option that I’m looking at, but I’d prefer to get there in the time and that’s why we’re being very ambitious with the options we’re looking at.</p> \n   <p>Every option is on the table to get to that target. But can I say in almost a decade, the previous government returned two of those 450GL for environmental uses, for South Australia in particular. So in almost ten years the previous government got two gigalitres out of 450 that they promised. We’ve got a 2024 deadline to get the other 448GL. It’s challenging. I’m not going to pretend it’s not.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Greens water spokeswoman, <strong>Sarah Hanson-Young</strong>, said it was a “colossal task” but that rather than delaying the water, it should be bought. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Anything that pushes back SA and the river Murray getting the water that was promised of course is a breach of what was committed to.</p> \n   <p>Before we jump the shark and start delaying the water for the river and for SA, we need to use the tools that are already in the toolkit, and that’s voluntary buybacks. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Plibersek did say she’d already contracted 2GL, pointing out that she’d done that in two months, and it was as much as the former government had secured in almost a decade. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T04:54:26.669Z\">at 5.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e214c58f081e9f3bd21c32\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T04:48:37.191Z\">5.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>A question from Angus Taylor about cost of living</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Angus Taylor</strong> to <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My question is to the treasurer: Today the treasurer told us he painted a picture.

Will Labor consider implementing one? </p> \n  <p>(If you don’t know what a climate trigger is, it’s simple. A climate trigger would force an assessment of the climate impacts of new developments to be required to go through environmental approvals.)</p> \n  <p>Anyway, Plibersek was asked this morning would she consider inserting a climate trigger in a revamp of environmental law. Would that convince the Greens to vote for the targets bill?<strong><br></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Plibersek:</strong><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well what they’re talking about is changing our environmental laws so that a project can be stopped because it might add to greenhouse gas emissions. And it is important that we update our environmental legislation. </p> \n   <p>The previous government got a review from Prof Graeme Samuel a couple of years ago that made very clear that our environmental laws are just not fit for purpose. They’re not fit for the needs of business, they are slow, they are cumbersome, they often duplicate what’s happening at a state level, but they’re also not protecting our environment. </p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/labor-says-it-wont-put-head-in-the-sand-as-it-releases-shocking-environment-report\">state of the environment report</a> last week showed us that our environment is bad, it’s been getting worse and it’s on track to get even worse still. So we need to upgrade our laws and we’ve got a mapped-out plan to do that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Sky host: </strong>Sure.</p> \n  <p><strong>Plibersek:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We’ll respond first to Prof Graeme Samuel’s review and then we’ll draft legislation then. The Greens are welcome ... to make submissions on what those laws should look like, but I have to say Prof Samuel didn’t recommend an environmental trigger. He said that the laws that relate to carbon pollution and emissions reductions and climate change, that’s the proper place for making those decisions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Sky host: </strong>Okay, so you’d be inclined to follow him?</p> \n  <p><strong>Plibersek: </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, you know, I’m going to take my time and do it properly. The amazing thing about what Prof Samuel came up with is, he got environmental groups on one hand, and business groups on the other hand to agree to the vast bulk of the changes that he was suggesting to our environmental laws.

One word absent from the Treasurer’s speech was “<strong>recession</strong>”.<br><br>The textbook definition is two consecutive quarters of contraction, and there’s no sign of that in the revised forecasts. Phew.<br><br>In general, though, the statement was an attempt at setting a baseline – one that will be reinforced with the <strong>October budget –</strong> for the new government.<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The budget we inherited is bursting with waste and rorts, booby-trapped by expiring measures, and burdened by long-term demographic challenges that come with critical and necessary spending,” he said, repeating lines that we’ve heard before.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The updated numbers are interesting but if the success of forecasts in the past couple of years is any guide, we can probably take them with a hefty dosage of salt. By October, there will be new numbers - and higher interest rates - to feed into the models.</p> \n  <p>The famous<strong> $1 trillion </strong>debt load will start to cost a lot more to service, an expenditure that will grow <strong>faster</strong> than the NDIS and other costs. Interestingly, <strong>defence </strong>was not mentioned but that growth rate will be significant in the future.<br></p> \n  <p>One almost guaranteed upside - which will probably show up in the October budget - will come from commodities. The Treasury has to be conservative but the <strong>$US55 </strong>a tonne for iron ore is about half the current price.<br></p> \n  <p>Coking coal used in steelmaking is pencilled in at<strong> $US130 </strong>a tonne or less than half the current going rate. Thermal coal is estimated at $<strong>US60 </strong>a tonne compared with the $US300-plus rate globally as Europe in particular scrambles to gear up for less Russian gas (and coal) because of their evil war on Ukraine.</p> \n  <p>Of course, we need to be weaning ourselves off fossil fuels because of climate chaos even if that’s not an obvious objective of the Albanese government.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T03:25:12.053Z\">at 4.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e1ff4c8f08127940906d58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T03:15:58.815Z\">4.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Ministerial statements should look forwards, not backwards: Speaker</strong></p> \n  <p>Murph has an update for those who are following along with the standing orders:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo/status/1552489268127608833\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Interesting micro development after the Chalmers ministerial statement.

It basically stops one big governing body from getting too powerful. <br></p> \n  <p>The separation of powers works like this:<br></p> \n  <p>The parliament is where laws can be made and changed. It is made up of the governor general, the Senate and the House of Representatives. This arm is also known as the legislature (because of its power over creation of legislature). <br></p> \n  <p>The executive is where the governor general, prime minister and ministers put law into action and enforce them. <br></p> \n  <p>And the judiciary is where judgements on law are made, by federal courts like the high court. <br></p> \n  <p>The idea is that Australia maintains a responsible government where the party or coalition in charge is held accountable by the parliament and judiciary to not abuse their power.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>This principle is pretty ancient.

The last time an incumbent lost his seat in Kooyong was 1922. Proof positive, Mr Speaker, that not all once-in-a-century events are bad.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ryan credits Kooyong’s previous members, including <strong>Sir Robert Menzies, Andrew Peacock </strong>and<strong> Petro Georgiou </strong>who she describes as<em> </em>“true liberals; they recognised that open markets are the best way to boost prosperity” and “committed to protecting individuals’ rights”:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I hope to honour that legacy by representing the electorate with dedication, integrity and effect. I am the first woman, and the first independent, to represent this electorate. I will not be the last.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ryan describes climate change as “the greatest challenge for our generation”:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have lived through a wasted decade of ineffective action on climate change. As a doctor, researcher and scientist, my job has always been to care for children and to protect their futures. I stood for election for the seat of Kooyong because I felt – and the people of Kooyong felt – that our previous government was not doing that. </p> \n   <p>In recent years, the effects of the climate emergency have become apparent to us all. Science has shown us that we need increased ambition and urgent action in our rapid transition to a net zero emissions world. We stand on the precipice of a great opportunity: a transformation to a new clean energy economy - an economy which will not need to rely on volatile markets and international security for a secure energy supply. An economy away from polluting fuels and combustion vehicles to quiet electric vehicles and clean air for our children. </p> \n   <p>Our renewable energy resources are the envy of the world. We can use these natural advantages to bring down the cost of electricity for households: to protect our elderly neighbours from heatwaves; to ensure Australian families don’t have to decide between heating or food; to support our small and large businesses; and, to help position our country as the natural home of energy-intensive industries in the Asia- Pacific.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also describes Kooyong’s choice at this election in terms that suggested it was an act of solidarity with communities harmed by global heating:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To the rural communities of western NSW and Queensland with farms and towns hit by drought – the people of Kooyong voted for you. To the people of Cobargo and Mallacoota and Kangaroo Island, whose homes burned during that black summer – Kooyong voted for you. To the people of Lismore and Woodburn whose houses have this year been inundated again and again by flood, Kooyong voted for you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-28T00:03:27.680Z\">at 1.03am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e1c8158f081e9f3bd21a7e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-27T23:24:46.030Z\">12.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jacinta Nampijinpa Price admonishes Albanese over Indigenous voice plans</strong></p> \n  <p>Country Liberal party senator <strong>Jacinta Nampijinpa Price</strong> delivered her first speech last night.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"134fd226a49fbba4d6096927dd92aa49bcc4d17a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/134fd226a49fbba4d6096927dd92aa49bcc4d17a/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The senators embrace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacinta Nampijinpa<strong> </strong>Price is congratulated by Jana Stewart, Malarndirri McCarthy and Pat Dodson after her first speech in the Senate chamber.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><a href=\"https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/chamber/hansards/25929/toc_pdf/Senate_2022_07_27.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf\">You can find the whole text here (from page 81)</a>.</p> \n  <p>Price had a lot to say but it is her view on the government’s vow to enshrine an Indigenous voice to parliament that has captured the most attention:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This government has yet to demonstrate how this proposed voice will deliver practical outcomes and unite, rather than drive a wedge further between, Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia.

Aubrey Gordon and Michael Hobbes take charge of this incisive and often sarky podcast, tackling the biggest myths in wellness, science and nutritional fads, while recommending more measured means of taking care of yourself in the process. Among the topics covered are the limitations of Matthew Walker’s bestselling book Why We Sleep, as well as the myths behind Oprah’s weight loss promotions.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://rubinmuseum.org/page/mindfulness-meditation-podcast\">Rubin Museum Mindfulness Meditation Podcast</a><br></strong>For those who need some guidance to quieten their daily anxieties and focus on the present moment instead, there are a plethora of mindfulness podcasts waiting to help. Series like The Mindful Minute present guided meditations that range in length from five to 45 minutes, while shows such as On Being discuss the nuances of spirituality and meditative practice. New York’s Rubin Museum of Art takes a fresh and engaging tack with its mindfulness podcast, using paintings and objects from its extensive collection of Asian art as the basis of its meditation</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Where-Should-We-Begin-with-Esther-Perel-Podcast/B08DDG9DLQ#:~:text=Step%20into%20iconic%20relationship%20therapist,to%20be%20heard%20and%20understood.\">Where Should We Begin? With Esther Perel</a><br></strong>So much of our mental health depends on the relationships we have with the people we love. While TV is increasingly giving us a window into the world of relational therapy through shows like Couples Therapy, writer and therapist Esther Perel has long had the monopoly on translating romantic resentments and betrayals into lessons we can all learn from. Her podcast Where Should We Begin? features a real therapy session with a couple each week, allowing often messy self-realisations to inform listeners’ reflections on our own lives. Although it can be heavy, listening to Perel is like witnessing an artist at work.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch\">Code Switch </a><br></strong>Our race, gender and sexual orientation – and how society treats us as a result of these factors – are all vital aspects of how our mental health is formulated. Audio series like Therapy for Black Girls and Bottoming tackle the effects of different perceptions with practical discussion, but NPR’s Code Switch stands out for its wider views on the ways that race impacts society and the mental health of people of colour. Each episode is hosted by a journalist recounting first-hand experiences, meaning it can veer tonally. However, it is always consistent in its honesty and learned advice. Begin with the fascinating episode on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1080901973\">whether therapy can solve racism</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/griefcast\">Griefcast</a><br></strong>Actor and comic Cariad Lloyd’s podcast – in which she interviews media personalities about their experiences of bereavement – has garnered a loyal following since it began in 2017. Radical in its frankness, and willingness to probe the dark contradictions of how we react to the deaths of our loved ones, Griefcast has done more than perhaps any other mental health podcast to help make sense of the end of life. Lloyd’s own story of her father’s death from pancreatic cancer when she was 15 informs her compassionate interviewing, while Covid gives more recent episodes a wider remit, making them a salve in trying times.</p> <h2><strong>Why not try …</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Gripping porn industry investigation <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/hot-money-who-rules-porn/id1621757273\">Hot Money</a>, now available in full. <br></p></li> <li><p>A look at sporting glory and US society in <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/all-american-venus-serena/id1525472214\">All American: Venus and Serena.</a></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>More tales of fearless female mavericks, as <a href=\"https://www.thelastbohemians.co.uk/listen\">The Last Bohemians</a> heads to LA.</p></li> </ul> <p>• This article was amended on 3 August 2022 to link to the dramatisation of The Electricity of Every Living Thing, rather than the audiobook.</p> <p><em>If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/10/hear-here-podcast-recommendations-sign-up-for-unexpected-audio-pleasures\">please subscribe</a> to receive Hear Here in your inbox every Thursday</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/28/shit-area-shit-house-queensland-police-officer-allegedly-told-not-to-waste-time-investigating-womans-death-inquiry-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T08:39:39Z","webTitle":"‘Shit area, shit house’: Queensland police officer allegedly told not to waste time investigating woman’s death, inquiry hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/shit-area-shit-house-queensland-police-officer-allegedly-told-not-to-waste-time-investigating-womans-death-inquiry-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/shit-area-shit-house-queensland-police-officer-allegedly-told-not-to-waste-time-investigating-womans-death-inquiry-hears","fields":{"headline":"‘Shit area, shit house’: Queensland police officer allegedly told not to waste time investigating woman’s death, inquiry hears","trailText":"Survey of 53 QPS officers revealed ‘prettier’ domestic violence victims more likely to receive attention from police, inquiry hears","byline":"Eden Gillespie","body":"<p>A senior Queensland police officer reportedly told a co-worker that police did not investigate the suspicious death of a domestic violence victim because she and her husband were a “a pair of scumbags who live in a shit area in a shit house”, an inquiry has heard.</p> <p>At the commission of inquiry into Queensland police responses to domestic violence on Wednesday, Mark Ainsworth, a consultant and former police officer, revealed a female officer recounted the story during a survey he undertook of 53 police officers across the state.

Chalmers is seeking to distinguish his approach from the near-decade of Coalition rule that preceded it.</p> \n<p>Anyone hoping for extra cost-of-living relief would have been disappointed but probably not surprised. Chalmers will probably save any sweeteners – if there are any – for his budget, but there is actually little room for the government to move.</p> \n<p>Childcare support, cheaper medical prescriptions and spending on a modernised electricity grid to allow faster take-up of low-cost renewable energy were his main offerings that we’ve heard about before.</p> \n<p>“They are very boxed in by election promises,” says John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra who served as a senior economist with both Treasury and the RBA. That means the fuel excise cut – costing $3bn for just six months – won’t be extended and nor will the low- and middle-income tax offset.</p> \n<p>“Even if they do try to give people money to compensate for the cost of living pressures, that’s just going to stimulate the economy more,” Hawkins says. To spend more would be having the “RBA jumping on the brake and the government jumping on the accelerator”.</p> \n<p>Chalmers’ speech, though, was partly aimed at massaging expectations, particularly for workers anxious their wages are not keeping up with inflation – in fact are falling further behind.</p> \n<p>For now, the treasurer is projecting 2023-24 as the year wages finally grow faster than headline inflation. By most estimates, there is a lot of slippage to claw back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GrogsGamut/status/1552522263895089152\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Using the full updated figures out to June 2026 supplied by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JEChalmers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JEChalmers</a> today.

The March quarter WPI was 2.4% and Chalmers’ update on Thursday pencilled in 2.75% for the year to June.</p> \n<p>“It’s surprising how little acceleration there has been in wages at a time when the unemployment rate is down to 3.5%,” Hawkins says.</p> \n<p>That may change as employers bid against each other to fill vacancies. Still, the Treasury estimates only project WPI quickening to 3.75% by June 2023 – a level it will hold roughly firm for the years out to June 2026.</p> \n<p>Another constraint on the budget – and hence, on Chalmers’ inclination to spend – are the mounting costs. The rising bill for Australia’s trillion-dollar debt will outpace the NDIS and another demands. Defence, which Chalmers did not refer to, will also command a growing mountain of money.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a> </p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>However, as Cherelle Murphy, the chief economist for EY Australia, notes, there remain “a lot of positives in the economy”.</p> \n<p>“We do have a very highly employed labour market and we’ve got the highest workforce participation rate in history,” Murphy says.

The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor’s final report <a href=\"https://www.inslm.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-07/nsi-report-4thinslm-17june-2022.pdf\">was tabled in parliament on Thursday</a>. It made a series of recommendations to overhaul the laws.</p> <p>“Alan Johns shows how s22 [of the NSI Act] can be used to conduct a federal criminal prosecution in ‘secret’ from start to finish and to maintain this secrecy, seemingly, indefinitely,” the report found. “This should not have happened in Alan Johns and it should never happen again.”</p> <p>The report identified four aspects of the case that were unusual and one which was “unprecedented”. The unprecedented aspect of the case, the report found, was that no sentencing remarks were ever released publicly.</p> <p>Remarkably, the report found there was nothing stopping the “vast majority” of the sentencing remarks from being published.</p> <p>The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, immediately announced a review of the NSI Act following the release of the report.</p> <p>“Today I asked the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM), Grant Donaldson SC, to conduct a review into the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 (NSI Act),” he said.</p> <p>He said Donaldson supported the need for a review of the laws.</p> <p>“The review will consider how the commonwealth can better balance the vital importance of open justice with the essential need to protect national security.”</p> <p>Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Kieran Pender said secret prosecutions had no place in liberal democracies and urged Dreyfus to quickly implement the report’s recommendations. </p> <p>“Open justice is a central tenet of Australian democracy and unnecessary secrecy is corrosive to public confidence in the judiciary,” he said. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/jul/28/shocking-sexism-and-harassment-in-australias-film-industry-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T08:09:36Z","webTitle":"‘Shocking’ sexism and harassment in Australia’s film industry, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/28/shocking-sexism-and-harassment-in-australias-film-industry-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/jul/28/shocking-sexism-and-harassment-in-australias-film-industry-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"‘Shocking’ sexism and harassment in Australia’s film industry, report finds","trailText":"Study reveals women more experienced but paid less, while Oscar-nominated cinematographer Ari Wegner calls findings ‘confronting’","byline":"Kelly Burke","body":"<p>Australian female camera crew workers experienced “confronting” and “shocking” levels of sexism, according to one of the country’s leading cinematographers, with a new study finding that almost 90% of female operators have experienced discrimination or sexual harassment.</p> <p>Released on Thursday, the study into discrimination in the film industry was led by Dr Amanda Coles and Dr Justine Ferrer from Deakin University’s department of management.

But for women, and those identifying as LGBTQ+, culturally diverse or living with a disability, another layer of challenges confronted them in their workplace on a daily basis, the report’s authors said.</p> <p>Yet in an industry where reputation and the reliance on peer recommendation is crucial to contracts, few were prepared to confront instances of bullying, harassment or discrimination directly.</p> <h2>Women more experienced, paid less</h2> <p>While all cinematographers/directors of photography reported periods of under-employment and income insecurity between 2011 and 2019, the report found that women doing the same work as men were being paid less and having shorter careers.</p> <p>Men “consistently progressed into decision making, technically demanding and creatively prestigious roles in camera” at much higher rates than women.</p> <p>And as budgets grow, the likelihood of a film or television series hiring a female director decreased.</p> <p>Women directors of photography (DOPs) were most likely to work on low-budget features (21%) and Australian TV drama (19%), and less likely to work on feature films with budgets exceeding over $2m (14%).</p> <p>In big-budget films (more than $14.3m) made in Australia over the past decade, the DOPs were all men. And among the 26 cinematographers who reported earning more than $156,000 a year in the industry, there was not a single woman.</p> <p>But these figures were not a result of women in the industry being less qualified than their male peers.</p> <p>The study found 73% of women DOPs had more than 10 years professional experience, compared with 69% of men; and 95% of women DOPs held a relevant diploma qualification or higher, compared with 67% of men.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/saved-for-later\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Saved for Later\" data-form-description=\"Weekly lifestyle and culture picks from Guardian Australia\" data-form-campaign-code=\"UK_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Get a week’s worth of must-reads, trends and pop-culture in your inbox\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years a string of Australian female cinematographers have attracted international acclaim for their work, including Wegner, Mandy Walker (DOP on Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis), Zöe White (who filmed the The Handmaid’s Tale), and Bonnie Elliot (Apple TV+ series, Shining Girls).</p> <p>If Australia expects to further develop a world-class film industry, and attract international projects to its shores, it needs to establish an equitable, diverse and inclusive workplace culture, the report concluded.</p> <p>The report made 19 recommendations, including: mandatory compliance with the Australian Screen Industry code of practice on discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying (which is currently voluntary);

It was October 2020, Ibrahimovic was in the red-and-black of Milan, Lukaku the blue-and-black of Internazionale and the former had drawn first blood in the first Milan derby of the 2020-21 season, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/17/internazionale-milan-serie-a-match-report\">scoring twice in a 2-1 win</a>. “Milan has never had a king, just a god,” Ibrahimovic tweeted, in trademark self-effacing style.</p> <p>It was never going to take much for tempers to flare when next they met. The way that Ibrahimovic tells it in his new book, Adrenaline: My Untold Stories, it is unapologetically his side of the story. It started when Lukaku argued with Alexis Saelemaekers, the young Milan midfielder, in the 45th minute of last January’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/26/internazionale-milan-coppa-italia-quarter-final-match-report\">Coppa Italia quarter-final</a> at San Siro.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/jul/06/football-transfer-window-summer-2022-mens-deals-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1-club-guides\">Football transfer window summer 2022 – Europe’s top five men’s leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ibrahimovic, as his team’s leader and senior professional, knew that he had to step in and he told Lukaku to pipe down. “What’ll you do if I don’t?” Lukaku replied. “I’m going to break every bone in your body if you open your mouth,” Ibrahimovic said.</p> <p>It was on, the players bumping heads and trading insults, with Ibrahimovic, in his words, going for Lukaku’s achilles heel. “Go tell your mother to do a voodoo spell for you,” he shouted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5ba5b68422a6ab4663bd67c710332a9837f7395\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5ba5b68422a6ab4663bd67c710332a9837f7395/0_199_5156_3095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mural on a wall at San Siro depicts Milan’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic headbutting Inter’s Romelu Lukaku.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural on a wall at San Siro depicts Milan’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic headbutting Inter’s Romelu Lukaku.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Lukaku had left Everton in 2017 for United, having initially wanted to join Chelsea, it was said by Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s majority shareholder, that the player did so after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/09/romelu-lukaku-voodoo-message-everton-chelsea-farhad-moshiri\">receiving a voodoo message</a>. Moshiri inferred that Lukaku’s mother had encouraged him to take the advice. Lukaku has hotly denied this.</p> <p>According to the Swede, Lukaku saw red as the players headed for the interval and yelled at him from a distance: “I’m going to put three bullets in your head.”</p> <p>Despite Ibrahimovic being up for a physical fight in the tunnel, it did not happen. At which point, consider what happened next to Ibrahimovic. He was sent off in the 58th minute for a second yellow card and Inter won 2-1, having been 1-0 down at half-time, Lukaku scoring the equaliser.</p> <p>The following month, Inter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/21/milan-inter-match-report\">beat Milan 3-0 in the league</a>, Lukaku again on target. And, in early May, Inter wrapped up their first title since 2010. “The real god has crowned the king,” Lukaku tweeted. “Now bow down.”</p> <p>It was a tough period for Ibrahimovic as he suffered injuries while his personal physiotherapist also got Covid. “Could it have been that Lukaku had performed some voodoo ritual to hurt me?” Ibrahimovic reflected. But what he was perfectly clear about was his need for revenge.</p> <p>“In my mind, I decided that I had to settle things with Lukaku out on the pitch, the same way I had done with [Marco] Materazzi,” he continued in a nod to his long-running feud with the former Italy defender. “Unfortunately, he left Serie A [in the summer of 2021 for Chelsea] and we didn’t come up against them in the Champions League. But there will be other opportunities …”</p> <p>Such as this coming season, it turns out, with the Belgian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/21/romelu-lukaku-chelsea-internazionale-loan\">back at Inter on loan</a> from Chelsea and Ibrahimovic having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/18/never-ending-zlatan-ibrahimovic-new-milan-contract-40-years-old\">extended his contract at Milan</a> for a further year, despite a knee injury that is expected to keep him out until January. The second Milan derby of the league campaign is scheduled for the first weekend in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c8df75ccef9141b05bc34027023f843975dd568\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c8df75ccef9141b05bc34027023f843975dd568/0_111_2147_1288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweden’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates scoring against England, settling one of the many scores that drive his career.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweden’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates scoring against England, settling one of the many scores that drive his career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A reminder about Ibrahimovic’s history with Materazzi: in 2005, Ibrahimovic was at Juventus and he had been injured by a scissor-tackle from the Italian, then at Inter. Ibrahimovic vowed revenge and he got it in 2010 when he was at Milan for his first spell, with Materazzi still at Inter. Contesting a 50-50 ball in the derby, he leaped into Materazzi and cracked him hard across the temple with his elbow, putting just enough disguise on it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmqXoLVD3mM\">to make it look like a routine clash</a>. Materazzi was taken to hospital.</p> <p>“This is how things work in my world – you never forget and you wait patiently for the right time to take revenge,” Ibrahimovic said. “I told myself over and over: ‘When I get my hands on him, I’ll hurt him badly – so badly that he’ll remember what he did to me.’ And I’ll take my revenge in the light of day, making my motives and intentions perfectly clear to everyone.”</p> <p>There is a reason why “Adrenaline” is written in big letters across the cover of Ibrahimovic’s book. He is addicted to it, he seeks it in every challenge and he loves to stoke it by casting himself as having a score to settle. Such as against the English, who he felt had disrespected him as he laboured to score against Premier League clubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/mar/31/zlatan-ibrahimovic-barcelona-arsenal\">during the first-half of his career.</a></p> <p>Ibrahimovic would rip up the narrative with his four goals in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/14/england-sweden-friendly-repor-zlatan\">Sweden’s 4-2 win over England in 2012</a>, including <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/nov/16/zlatan-ibrahimovic-di-stefano-sweden-england\">that</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/nov/16/zlatan-ibrahimovic-di-stefano-sweden-england\"> overhead kick</a>. “One day I’ll build myself a museum and the football from the bicycle kick against England will enjoy pride of place,” he said.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic’s ego is stamped across every chapter of the book; at the age of 40, it shows no sign of softening. The references to himself as a god or an angel or Superman are matter of fact because, on Planet Zlatan, there is no arrogance, merely straight-talking and truth; his truth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"457743e50072f06af59cc4d6c58f3b86aa7fd0ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/457743e50072f06af59cc4d6c58f3b86aa7fd0ce/0_0_1524_2339/652.jpg\" alt=\"Adrenaline by Zlatan Ibrahimovic\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adrenaline by Zlatan Ibrahimovic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Hakan Calhanoglu is a fantastic kid,” Ibrahimovic wrote of his former Milan teammate, who went to Inter last summer. “He grew and matured immensely, thanks to me. Now the only challenge facing him is this: ‘Will I be able to achieve the same things without Ibra?’”</p> <p>The book is funny and entertaining, containing love for his loved ones, particularly his wife, Helena, his sons, Maximilian and Vincent, and his agent, Mino Raiola, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/mino-raiola-game-changer-both-hated-and-loved-in-football-agent\">who died in April</a>, and drive-bys for his enemies. Pep Guardiola, who could not handle his personality at Barcelona, is an inevitable target, Ibrahimovic noting that: “The ‘Philosopher’ prefers players who obey without talking back.”</p> <p>Ibrahimovic’s core values recur. Be yourself, warts and all. Give everything. Be prepared to suffer, to walk on fire. Thrive on it. The anecdotes, meanwhile, are plentiful. He details the lack of discipline at Paris Saint-Germain and the weird, petty-minded bureaucracy at United.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said he was once docked £1 from his wages for taking a fruit juice from the mini-bar at the team hotel while he quickly grew tired of being asked to show ID on his way into the training ground. “I’d tell the guy at the gate: ‘Listen, friend, I’ve been coming here every single day for the past month now. I’m the world’s best football player. If you still don’t recognise me, you’re in the wrong line of work.’”</p> <p>Ibrahimovic knows that he does not have long left as a player and there is rare vulnerability when he admits the prospect of retirement terrifies him. How will he get his adrenaline fixes? Before then, though, there is a fitness battle to win, more goals to score, another title to chase. And a confrontation with Lukaku.</p> <p><em>Adrenaline: My Untold Stories by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, published by Penguin, is out now and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/adrenaline-9780241996089\">available from the Guardian Bookshop</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2022/jul/28/anyone-you-me-everybody-could-be-dalia-garsingtons-refugee-community-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T08:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘Anyone – you, me, everybody – could be Dalia’: Garsington’s refugee community opera ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/28/anyone-you-me-everybody-could-be-dalia-garsingtons-refugee-community-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/jul/28/anyone-you-me-everybody-could-be-dalia-garsingtons-refugee-community-opera","fields":{"headline":"‘Anyone – you, me, everybody – could be Dalia’: Garsington’s refugee community opera ","trailText":"Performed by amateurs and professionals, Dalia – the tender story of a displaced girl who finds acceptance through cricket – is a rebuke to the UK’s increasingly cruel immigration policy","byline":"Jessica Duchen","body":"<p>When Roxanna Panufnik and I began to think about Dalia back in 2019, we knew the topic of the refugee crisis would only become more crucial. We had no idea, of course, that the situation would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/16/protesters-across-uk-decry-heinous-rwanda-deportation-plan\">so much more terrifying</a> by the time the premiere was upon us.</p> <p>The spark had come from Karen Gillingham, our director and Garsington Opera’s creative director of learning and participation. She had worked on a project four years ago, Dare to Dream, which linked local children, including refugees, with others in Uganda, Bangladesh and Syria, and she was eager to continue connecting and engaging young people across the globe in intercultural dialogue. She suggested the topic of the refugee crisis and we needed no further encouragement.</p> <p>The issue of displacement is close to both our hearts. Roxanna’s father, <a href=\"http://panufnik.com/biography/\">Sir Andrzej Panufnik</a>, was a celebrated Polish composer who escaped the communist regime in 1954, arriving in the UK as a political refugee. My great-grandparents left Lithuania and Latvia for South Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fleeing the pogroms against the Jewish community. Both my parents-in-law were born Jewish in Berlin in the 1920s; my mother-in-law, Gisela, came to the UK on <a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/6-stories-of-the-kindertransport\">the Kindertransport </a>aged 13. Her parents and brother had no way out and were murdered in concentration camps.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sport, like music, can unite people beyond words and boundaries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gisela was fostered by a kind Quaker family in the Midlands, but at school and among neighbours she faced hatred and suspicion for her German accent. Then she learned to play netball. Through sport, she began to find a new self-belief and acceptance from her peer group.</p> <p>Sport, like music, can unite people beyond words and boundaries – and Wormsley, where Garsington Opera is located, <a href=\"https://wormsley.com/cricket/\">also has a wonderful cricket ground</a>. Inspiration!</p> <p>Dalia is about a girl of about 12 or 13 who has fled the bombardment of Syria with her family. Her father and brother have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean and she is accidentally separated from her mother, Aisha. She is fostered in a small town in England where the local obsession is cricket. Dalia, though haunted by her traumas and encountering hostility in parts of the community, discovers a talent for the game, in which the staying power and determination she has developed help her progress. Then, on the day of a tournament final, she learns that her mother is alive and in Britain …</p> <p>Our ending is not all sweetness and light. Dalia has touched everyone’s lives, while her sporting success has brought her recognition and acceptance; Aisha, however, is confined to a refugee detention centre.</p> <p>We delved long and deep into the histories, processes and musical resonances that underpin this opera. Our Syrian dramaturg, Manas Ghanem, has been a crucial presence and encouraged me to include more lightness and brightness in the libretto (not least a cute scene in which Dalia teaches some younger children to sing her song), and the scents of jasmine and brewing coffee that Dalia sings of, reflect beautiful memories of her former home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8dc9390176a695200eb76e2d03b1d6fab4b963c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8dc9390176a695200eb76e2d03b1d6fab4b963c5/1149_0_2659_3324/800.jpg\" alt=\"Adrianna Forbes-Dorant as Dalia and Merit Ariane as Aisha in Dalia, a community opera at Garsington.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adrianna Forbes-Dorant (left) as Dalia and Merit Ariane as Aisha in Dalia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Fuller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The inspirational writer and speaker <a href=\"https://gulwalipassarlay.wordpress.com/\">Gulwali Passarlay</a> was also an important source of advice. His book The Lightless Sky chronicles his terrifying two-year journey from Afghanistan to Britain that began when he was only 12, and what he told us about his mental processes as a young refugee had a profound impact on my text. Dalia, safe at last in her foster family’s home, reflects that it is only now that she wants to give up. After two years on the road, uprooted, homeless, traumatised, bereaved, hungry, preyed on by smugglers, bullied by officials, being plunged into “normality” and surrounded by people who still sweat the small stuff is perhaps the hardest thing of all. And every night you relive your traumatic experiences in your dreams.</p> <p>Another adviser was Roxanna’s sister-in-law, Annie Macklow-Smith, who had worked for a children’s charity on boats in the Mediterranean, pulling refugee children out of the sea to safety. Tragically, Annie has recently died of cancer; Dalia is dedicated to her memory.</p> <p>One of Roxanna’s passions is researching traditional music from all over the world; in this she roots many of her works, approaching every note with respect and love. Dalia is no exception. She has grounded relevant episodes in Arabic modes, our orchestra includes an oud, and Dalia’s aria is based on the melody of an ancient folk song, Hal Asmar Ellon, which dates from the Babylonian era. Dalia’s mother, Aisha, is sung by the remarkable Egyptian-German soprano Merit Ariane, who will include Arabic-style improvisation in her performance.</p> <p>Meanwhile Dalia, subtitled a “Community Opera”, will be just that. Our cast consists of nearly 200. Alongside five professional singers will be Garsington’s adult community chorus and youth chorus, plus contingents of children from several local schools. One is Millbrook Combined School, where 60 different languages are spoken; many refugee children have been among its pupils. Many of the kids – plus some of the adults – will be getting their first ever taste of the stage.</p> <p>They are throwing themselves into the project with astounding energy. The adult chorus play several roles, including refugees, then friends, neighbours and sometimes detractors of Harry and Maya Roberts, Dalia’s foster parents in our fictional town of Hillcrest. One group of the children represent Dalia’s new schoolmates and youth-cricket friends. The others are her “inner voices”, echoing her memories, self-doubts, conflicts and longings. An extraordinary young singer, Adrianna Forbes-Dorant (who is 16), plays the title role, but each of the inner voices is part of her mind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bfc4de57a80805556d69bed17008a03fe9ecfc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfc4de57a80805556d69bed17008a03fe9ecfc7/0_319_5273_3164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket scene from Dalia, a community opera at Garsington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Howzat! … Dalia, a community opera at Garsington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Fuller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is where one of the most exciting parts of the whole project appears. We have been working with two remote choirs, the Al-Farah Choir in Damascus and the Amwaj Choir in Hebron. They have pre-recorded themselves singing key episodes, beautifully filmed with images intercutting the singing participants with surging waves, clouds and stars. In The Crossing Song and Dalia’s Song, they represent the inner voices of Dalia’s Middle Eastern homeland. Our conductor, Dougie Boyd, is coordinating the chorus to sing with the film (on two large LED screens) live on stage.</p> <p>Dalia is fed by a dizzying kaleidoscope of refugee stories. There are millions. We had no idea, in 2019, that in 2022 the refugee crisis would be vastly multiplied by a Russian invasion of Ukraine; nor that our government’s hard-line stance towards desperate people fleeing for their lives would be crueller than ever. At the end of Dalia, our heroine is accepted by her community and finds a source of joy; it is bittersweet, since she is still separated from her mother, but there is some hope for the future. Today, however, Dalia and Aisha might be targeted for deportation to Rwanda.</p> <p>The last word goes to Ella, from the Al-Farah Choir. “I am 12 years old,” she said during a remote-access workshop with Karen, “and I can see what is going on around the world. Anyone – you, me, everybody – could be Dalia. It’s the story of us, it’s our story, and the story must be sung.”</p> <p>• Dalia, a Community Opera, is at <a href=\"https://www.garsingtonopera.org/performance/dalia\">Garsington, Wormsley 28-31 July</a>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/28/becoming-liberal-in-conservative-family","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T08:00:42Z","webTitle":"The heartbreak of becoming a liberal in a conservative family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/28/becoming-liberal-in-conservative-family","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/28/becoming-liberal-in-conservative-family","fields":{"headline":"The heartbreak of becoming a liberal in a conservative family","trailText":"The more I learned, the more I realized that my Christian beliefs didn’t line up with this so-called Christian nation – and the more I tried to share what I’d learned with friends and family, the more they wrote me off as a lost cause","byline":"Jandra Sutton","body":"<p>In 2010, I knelt beside a family member as they cradled my laptop in their hands.</p> <p>We’d just spent 17 agonizing minutes watching the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/05/wikileaks-us-army-iraq-attack\">WikiLeaks’ Collateral Murder </a>video, which contained footage of the 2007 Baghdad airstrike during which US troops killed at least a dozen civilians, including two Reuters journalists, jeering as they opened fire.</p> <p>Tears welled in the corner of their eyes. The horror of watching US armed forces fire upon innocent people, laughing even as they injured children in the process, struck hard.</p> <p>For many, the Collateral Murder Video was a wake-up call. For others, like the person sitting next to me, it did the opposite.</p> <p>“It’s not real,” they said.</p> <p>The words hit me like a slap.</p> <p>“It can’t be real. I just … I don’t believe it.”</p> <p>I’d brought up the video in a last-ditch effort to repair yet another relationship fractured by political differences. Instead of building a bridge, however, it highlighted the widening divide between my past and present.</p> <p>•••</p> <p>I grew up in rural Indiana in a predominantly white, conservative bubble. I went to church three times a week and led prayer groups around my public school flagpole. I was desperately proud of my country, cheered when George W Bush won the 2000 election after “voting” for him in the middle school mock election, and viciously argued in his defense four years later when a classmate dared to criticize a sitting president.</p> <p>In a high school bracketed with cows and cornfields, I found belonging in my beliefs. This is what I knew – what my parents knew, what my friends knew, what my church knew – and nothing could convince me otherwise.</p> <p>It took attending a private Christian university less than an hour away to change everything. As a freshman, I eagerly signed the school’s “community life agreement”, pledging to abstain from all vices (sex, gambling, alcohol) until after graduation. I agreed to a campus-wide ban on R-rated movies and non-choreographed dancing. I attended mandatory chapel twice a week, went to a local church on Sundays and, instead of chafing in the sheltered environment, I thrived.</p> <p>Everything should’ve stayed the same, and for countless students it did. But after my first year, while my fellow students kept on finding answers, I started to find questions.</p> <p>I had a British academic adviser who taught outside of the American perspective, and whose classes challenged the gleaming American idealism I held so dear. I learned about how the US <a href=\"https://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/walrus_cambodiabombing_oct06.pdf\">carpet-bombed Cambodia</a> during the Vietnam war, dropping over 2.7m tons of bombs on the country over an eight-year period, and was shocked to learn this paled in comparison to the combined 2m tons of bombs the Allies dropped during the second world war, even when factoring in the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p> <p>Next, I learned about the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/My-Lai-Massacre#ref336979\">My Lai massacre</a>, in which US soldiers raped, tortured and killed hundreds of innocent Vietnamese people while several orders to stop the killings were <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/RDAR-Vol-I/RDAR-Vol-I.pdf\">systematically ignored</a>.</p> <p>The more I learned, the more I realized that my Christian beliefs didn’t line up with the so-called Christian nation in which I was raised. The Bible told me to care for the sick, hungry and poor, while my fellow Republicans raged against universal healthcare, food stamps, and argued <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/02/why-people-are-rich-and-poor-republicans-and-democrats-have-very-different-views/\">poverty was the result of laziness</a>. As the veil slipped away, I realized American exceptionalism wasn’t some God-given duty to protect democracy around the world, but a delusion sold to the American people which fueled our <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/military-industrial-complex\">military-industrial complex</a>. And we were falling for it hook, line and sinker.</p> <p>The more I tried to share what I’d learned with my friends and family, the more they wrote me off as a lost cause. My parents joked that I had “turned liberal”, and couldn’t wait for me to leave my conservative Christian college so things could go back to normal.</p> <p>In person, the conversations I tried to have about religion and politics were stilted and brief. Online, they were vicious. Social media was particularly brutal, and the older members of my church were among the most bloodthirsty. No matter how delicately I tried to broach a conversation, share sources or ask questions our conversation ended in a bloodbath. Once the personal attacks started – led by friends, church members and even the occasional family member – I gave up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter how delicately I tried to broach a conversation, share sources, or ask questions our conversation ended in a bloodbath</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After finishing my degree and moving to the UK to pursue a master’s degree in history, I realized I couldn’t keep the US on the pedestal I’d placed it. Life in England solidified my changing perspectives. Not only were the people wildly different than the ones I’d grown up with – my friend group included both socialists and blue bloods running in the same circles – even the Christians I met surprised me. Gone were the puritanical attitudes obsessed with the battle between sin and virtue, and in its place were some of the most welcoming and warm-hearted people I’d ever met.</p> <p>Returning to the US in late 2012 was a culture shock. I moved back in with my parents while applying for jobs only to realize that my idyllic home town didn’t feel quite as safe as before. The open-mindedness I’d encountered at university was replaced with vicious political discourse, where even a kind neighbor warned me to be the “good” kind of journalist, leaving me to realize that – if I wasn’t careful – I’d be labeled as the enemy.</p> <p>It didn’t matter that I grew up in the same zip code, attended the same schools, went to the same churches. A simple difference in opinion was enough to place a target on my back, and I knew I needed to get out. I took a job in marketing that moved me out of state and headed to Nashville, finding a tiny liberal pocket in the Bible belt, where I met countless others who shared a similar experience.</p> <p>One woman, Marie*, reached out to me after reading a lengthy conversation I had with another Republican on Facebook. A pastor’s wife in a moderately sized congregation in a conservative state and a lifelong Republican, she felt shocked by the growing support for Donald Trump.</p> <p>“I feel like Trump is using Evangelical Christians,” she wrote in her initial message. “[But] I don’t understand how a human can think these things are ok.”</p> <p>We reconnected recently, and she told me how she watched in shock as more and more people around her began to follow Trump with what she described as “cultish” fervor, with some going so far as to believe that only Republicans could be considered Christians. While she and her husband refused to express overtly political opinions from the pulpit, she described the anger she saw in some people as proof that something wasn’t right.</p> <p>“With family, it was a whole lot harder ’cause we were all raised strongly Republican,” she explained. “So for any of us to break away from not totally agreeing 100% with a candidate, it was like I had gone to the other side.”</p> <p>In the end, she found herself asking many of the same questions I had, especially as she watched those closest to her, including her siblings and daughter, begin to espouse radically different ideas. It was heartbreaking to watch, she told me, and while she tried to remain optimistic, she said it felt as if the whole world was changing around her, and nothing made sense.</p> <p>“I was like, ‘Where are these crazy comments coming from?’ This is not foundational, this is not Christian,’” she said. “Why are people following Trump so blindly? What am I missing?”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It can be mind-boggling to watch someone disregard what you perceive as concrete evidence. Unfortunately, logic has little to do with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For casual observers like Marie and myself, it can be mind-boggling to watch someone disregard what you perceive as concrete evidence. Unfortunately, logic has little to do with it.</p> <p>“Most people assume that deeply held beliefs are held because they are logical, and that is often the assumptive flaw. Deeply held beliefs are often held for other reasons entirely,” explains psychologist <a href=\"https://www.drgurner.com/\">Julie Gurner</a>. “Things like strong emotional attachments, social or personal reasons, and group membership make people particularly resilient to changing beliefs.”</p> <p>A lot of this boils down to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/cognitive-bias\">cognitive biases</a>, the subconscious tendencies in human thinking and reasoning that influence our judgment, decision-making and even our behavior. Confirmation bias, for instance, is one of the heaviest hitters: our brains tend to seek information that supports our existing beliefs and ignore information that challenges them.</p> <p>The internet made this phenomenon worse, something I watched first-hand as my friends and family members began using Facebook as a source of news. I tried serving as a friendly factchecker at first, happy to put my history degrees to work. Most people ignored me; the burden of proof seemed to disappear. If something got enough likes and sounded correct, it was all-too-easy to hit share.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Lerman/Kristina\">Kristina Lerman</a>, principal scientist at the University of Southern California’s Information Sciences Institute, says her <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147617\">research</a> has identified what she calls a “majority illusion” – which is what happens when social media distorts our observations of what people believe until we start to overestimate the popularity of information. In some conditions, this can even lead people to believe things are far more believed and accepted than they actually are.</p> <p>This is what happened with my friends and family. I didn’t own a television before last year, so I never watched mainstream or cable news networks, while my parents tuned into Fox News. As a millennial, I lived by the warning drilled into us from a young age – don’t believe everything you read online – and grew frustrated when others seemed to ignore that same advice. I tried my best to receive most of my news from following local and international journalists on Twitter, but even that was tinted with bias. The more my social network grew – and the more active it became – the easier it was to get trapped in an echo chamber.</p> <p>It’s something I’m still wary of, especially given the ever-increasing political divide. Misinformation rages on, and I don’t want to fall into the same trap that I’ve seen claim so many others.</p> <p>I don’t go to church any more, but I still lead every conversation with a conservative Christian with, “I grew up in the church.” It’s a trick I’ve learned over the years that reminds people that we’re not so very different while making it easier for the dialogue to progress from there. I’ve slowly rebuilt my relationship with my parents – although I’m admittedly terrified of them reading this article – and I’m working up the courage to reach out to my brother after a particularly brutal argument about politics on Facebook disintegrated our relationship years ago.</p> <p>I haven’t given up on nudging all of them back toward the centrist beliefs they used to hold. We still talk about politics from time to time, and I try to start every conversation with empathy. Instead of railing against the things that I think they’re doing or saying or believing, I take a deep breath and think about why.</p> <p>Why do they hold this position? Why do they feel this way? Why are my beliefs different?</p> <p>I remind myself that beliefs are heavily influenced by emotions, not just facts, and I try to connect the dots.</p> <p>My relationship with my family is still rocky, but – thanks to time and therapy – it’s one I’ve come to terms with. I’ve learned to surround myself with my chosen family, people who share my beliefs while challenging me to stretch beyond my limits and grow, and this has made it easier for me to connect with my friends and relatives back home on my terms.</p> <p>We might not have the same relationship we had before, and that relationship might not look the way either of us wish it did, but that’s OK. Either way, I feel better knowing that I’m still trying.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/28/labor-drops-coalition-bid-to-overturn-high-court-ruling-that-indigenous-australians-cant-be-aliens","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T08:00:38Z","webTitle":"Labor drops Coalition bid to overturn high court ruling that Indigenous Australians can’t be aliens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/labor-drops-coalition-bid-to-overturn-high-court-ruling-that-indigenous-australians-cant-be-aliens","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/labor-drops-coalition-bid-to-overturn-high-court-ruling-that-indigenous-australians-cant-be-aliens","fields":{"headline":"Labor drops Coalition bid to overturn high court ruling that Indigenous Australians can’t be aliens","trailText":"Decision by attorney general Mark Dreyfus guarantees a dozen Aboriginal non-citizens at risk of deportation will be able to stay in Australia","byline":"Paul Karp","body":"<p>The Albanese government has abandoned a controversial high court case that sought to restore the commonwealth’s power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens.</p> <p>The decision by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, guarantees that a dozen Aboriginal non-citizens at risk of deportation will be able to stay in Australia, and<strong> </strong>ends the former Coalition government’s attempt to overturn the landmark precedent of Love and Thoms.</p> <p>In February 2020, the high court ruled that Aboriginal people cannot be aliens, putting them beyond the reach of the immigration minister’s powers to detain and deport non-citizens.</p> <p>But in October 2021, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/oct/14/australia-seeks-to-overturn-landmark-ruling-preventing-deportation-of-aboriginal-people\">Guardian Australia revealed</a> the Morrison government was attempting to use the case of Shayne Montgomery, a New Zealand citizen culturally adopted as Aboriginal, to overturn that precedent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/oct/14/australia-seeks-to-overturn-landmark-ruling-preventing-deportation-of-aboriginal-people\">Australia seeks to overturn landmark ruling preventing deportation of Aboriginal people</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In November last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/19/judge-orders-new-zealand-man-who-had-visa-revoked-by-peter-dutton-to-be-freed-from-detention\">the federal court ordered</a> Montgomery to be released from immigration detention, sparking a commonwealth appeal to the high court which was heard in April.

He compared the premier, Daniel Andrews, to Adolf Hitler in another post.</p> <p>Finn, who now sits on the crossbench, will be running as a Democratic Labour party candidate in the same seat at the November election.</p> <p>Finn publicly endorsed Deeming ahead of the preselection vote, which involved about 40 party members. She won more than twice the number of votes as her nearest rival in Saturday’s vote and is believed to have had the backing of the outgoing state party president, Robert Clark, and his allies.</p> <p>Members of the administrative committee were approached for comment but declined, citing party rules.</p> <p>Elsbury, a Liberal member for almost 25 years, described Deeming as Finn’s “anointed successor”.</p> <p>“Bernie introduced Moira to the Liberal party, he’s had her under his wing for years,” he said.</p> <p>“So to think that we’re going to have any change in the Liberal party, which is desperately needed in the west – we are dying, our vote is collapsing – we needed to have a clean break, to be able to move on. That opportunity is gone.”</p> <p>All 11 lower house seats that make up the Western Metropolitan Region are held by Labor, the majority by comfortable margins.</p> <p>In the upper house, the region is represented by five MPs, none of whom are Liberals, after Finns’s expulsion. Elsbury said this has allowed Labor to take the area for granted.</p> <p>“We’ve got so much that needs doing out here,” he said, citing lack of infrastructure in the growing region as the most pressing issue.</p> <p>“We need an MP who is representative of the region, who takes the issues that are important to ministers and to the parliament to highlight where there is a failure. We can’t afford a purely ideological individual.”</p> <p>It comes as it was revealed Deeming was rejected as a Liberal candidate for the federal election in the lower house seat of Gorton, amid concerns her views could distract from then prime minister Scott Morrison’s campaign.</p> <p>In March, the Victorian Liberal branch’s administrative committee voted for Deeming to run in the very safe Labor seat in Melbourne’s western suburbs but before she was formally endorsed, the group was warned against it. Another vote was conducted and a different candidate picked.</p> <p>Just days later, Katherine Deves was handpicked by a special committee, which included Morrison, to run in the seat of Warringah, but lost to independent Zali Steggall. Deves became a lightning rod for criticism <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/25/nsw-police-not-aware-of-any-threats-made-against-katherine-deves\">over her comments about transgender people</a> during the campaign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/25/victoria-health-minister-accuses-liberals-of-selecting-anti-abortion-bernie-finn-clone\">‘Voters don’t want a culture war’: Victorian Liberals raise concerns over preselections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two sources have told Guardian Australia there was an attempt to overturn Deeming’s latest nomination but it was unsuccessful.</p> <p>Privately, Liberal MPs and internal party figures have argued voters in the west are more socially conservative than in other parts of the state, and that they would agree with Deeming’s views.</p> <p>But Elsbury disagrees.</p> <p>“We really need to have bread and butter issues taken care of before we go off on a vanity project,” he said.</p> <p>The opposition leader in the upper house, David Davis, said the Liberals were a “clearly a very diverse party and we have our own internal party processes”.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, the national</em> <em>counselling and referral service for LGBTIQ+ people, <a href=\"https://qlife.org.au/\">QLife</a>, is 1800 184 527.</em> <em>The crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Before officials stopped her at Sheremetyevo International Airport on 17 February for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/brittney-griner-reportedly-detained-russia\">allegedly bringing cannabis oil into Russia</a>, the WNBA star’s impact went beyond high-scoring games, Olympic gold medals and fast-break dunks. Outside of sports, Griner has often used her voice to galvanize and help the masses.</p> <p>When American cities were filled with protests in 2020 after the police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, Griner used her fame <a href=\"https://eu.azcentral.com/story/sports/wnba/mercury/2020/08/01/wnba-brittney-griner-unfraid-sayhername-breonna-taylor/5560848002/\">to help bring attention</a> to systemic issues that are often faced by marginalized communities.

Instead, photos have replaced words and served as Griner’s primary tool of expression, even as Wednesday’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/27/brittney-griner-prisoner-swap-biden-administration\">report of a potential prisoner swap</a> between the US and Russian governments offered a rare note of hope amid her months-long detainment.</p> <p>The most striking image came this week and summed up both her spirit and the heartbreak of her separation from her loved ones. Griner, trapped behind the bars of a Russian holding cell, gave a subtle smile while holding photos of her wife, Cherrelle, best friends and teammates. A few weeks prior, she was photographed holding another picture of WNBA players wearing her No 42 jersey at this year’s WNBA All-Star game.</p> <p>“Like we say, we are the most unified league in the world, honestly, and wearing the jerseys was a statement to show that we are BG,” A’ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces said in response to the league’s decision to honor Griner.</p> <p>Griner’s decision to use photos as a means of expression reveals a deeper message about the uncertainty of her future. With her long-term freedom in jeopardy, each photo that she holds serves as a lifeline. Even though she is detained and isolated in a foreign jail, she’s not experiencing this ordeal alone. There are loved ones, teammates and fans hoping for the best outcome as she faces up to the possibility of 10 years in a Russian prison.</p> <p>In the moments before she was photographed with the picture of her wife and best friends, Griner briefly spoke to an ABC News reporter. She wished her wife good luck on her upcoming bar exam. When asked if she had any complaints, Griner responded, “no complaints”.</p> <p>During her testimony in court Griner has expanded on her defense attorney’s claim that the cannabis oil was used for medicinal purposes. It’s unclear if the judge can be swayed or if fairness was ever an option, given that most experts in the US view her detainment as a political ploy by the Russian government during a time of heightened tension between Washington and Moscow. But Griner is a fighter who has always used her skills to overwhelm opponents on the court while using her voice to fight for justice and help those in need off it.</p> <p>The photo shows Griner is still fighting, she’s still finding ways to connect with the masses and those she loves, and she’s using her voice even if she can’t speak out loud.</p> <p>At this moment, when circumstances have made it so hard for her to speak directly to the world, a photo is worth more than words.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/28/rubbish-revelations-collectors-combine-recycling-and-garbage-in-some-sydney-streets","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T07:19:25Z","webTitle":"Rubbish revelations: collectors combine recycling and garbage in some Sydney streets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/rubbish-revelations-collectors-combine-recycling-and-garbage-in-some-sydney-streets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/rubbish-revelations-collectors-combine-recycling-and-garbage-in-some-sydney-streets","fields":{"headline":"Rubbish revelations: collectors combine recycling and garbage in some Sydney streets","trailText":"Canterbury-Bankstown mayor says bin mixing due to ‘problematic locations’, sparking wider reflection on Australia’s waste system","byline":"Caitlin Cassidy","body":"<p>A south-west Sydney mayor has called for a full review of his council’s waste operations after revelations rubbish collectors had been mixing yellow-bin recycling with red-bin garbage for more than a decade.</p> <p>Residents said they had not been informed of the long-running practice, which resulted from “public safety” concerns over backing large trucks down narrow streets.</p> <p>The Canterbury-Bankstown mayor, Khal Asfour, said he shared his community’s frustrations and took the issue “very seriously”, saying when council had been made aware of the issues it had worked with the public to address them.</p> <p>“I want to stress that this is not happening across the city, but in a handful of hard-to-access streets,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/20/australians-buy-almost-15kg-of-clothes-every-year-and-most-of-it-ends-up-in-landfill-report-finds\">Australians buy almost 15kg of clothes every year and most of it ends up in landfill, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Obviously there are still some problematic locations … that’s why I have called on council staff to undertake a full review.

red bins for mixing … the kerb-side collection system is not fit for purpose for the circular economy.</p> <p>“Governments have spent years trying to have common colours, educate households about what to put in which bin, which frankly has its limits.”</p> <p>Angel said there would “always be contamination” in separate bins which meant recyclable resources would be wasted, while suspending the outsourcing of waste to countries like China had placed Australia under increased pressure.</p> <p>“We’re now having to confront sloppy practices we tolerated,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s impossible to source separate once everything is mixed up … internationally we’re performing quite poorly … we’re stuck.”</p> <p>Angel said unless Australia could drastically improve in separating items at their source through financial incentives like container refund schemes, the 2025 and 2030 national waste recycling targets wouldn’t be met.</p> <p>Under the national action plan, introduced after the

The vast majority of the Commonwealth countries are former colonies and 14 excluding Britain are still officially headed by the British royal family.

There’s a lot to do, though some aspects have become easier – you can notify most branches of government through an online form called <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once\">Tell Us Once</a>. But some private interests are less helpful.</p> <p>My mother died in early March. My father is confused and very frail, so my sister and my dad’s carer and I handled the sadmin. Most of it went smoothly: in many cases cancelling my mother’s accounts was quick and straightforward. That was until we ran into Vodafone.</p> <p>A long time ago my father set up two Vodafone contracts, one for himself and one for my mother. He stopped using his phone a few years ago, and we cancelled his contract. But my mum used hers almost until the end of her life. After she died, we followed the only available route, and rang the company. Or tried, dozens of times, before giving up after 40 or 50 minutes waiting for someone to answer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A remarkable number of people reported that call handlers insisted on speaking to the deceased account holder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When my dad’s carer managed at last to speak to a human being, the person who answered was astonishingly rude and unhelpful. He passed us around the system, but no one seemed willing to cancel the contract. We assumed we had caught someone on a bad day, but every encounter, on the rare occasions when someone picked up the phone, followed the same pattern: breathtaking aggression and hostility, followed by stonewalling.</p> <p>They kept demanding to speak to my father, and refused to hear answers from anyone else, even after we pointed out that my sister and I have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney\">lasting power of attorney.</a> The only way we could meet this demand was to dictate the answers to him, which he repeated to the call handler. This caused him great stress and anxiety. Among other questions, they asked him the exact date on which the account commenced. They might as well have asked how many grains of sand there are in the Sahara. When he was unable to answer (none of us knew), they refused to cancel the account.</p> <p>This went on until May. Vodafone continued to charge my dad for a contract that should have ended the day my mum died. Eventually my sister told a call handler she intended to stop the direct debit. He replied: “Do what you like, but you’ll be in breach of contract.” She stopped it anyway, ​and posted a letter to Vodafone HQ (there was no other means of contacting the company) informing it. Without warning, Vodafone passed the matter to a debt collection agency, which started pursuing my dad for the £33 bill it deemed my mum to have incurred since she died. The agents rang my dad’s landline repeatedly, every time insisting on speaking to him. His carer refused. Had my dad not been shielded, these calls would have inflicted immense distress.</p> <p>My mum suffered a long and debilitating illness, and we were as prepared for her death as anyone can be. We are blessed with the support of my dad’s brilliant carer. Even so, Vodafone made everything much worse. I can scarcely imagine how this might have affected a family unexpectedly bereaved, under great stress and with fewer resources.</p> <p>A fortnight ago, more than four months after my mother’s death, I belatedly snapped, and described our experience in a <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/1546453244922269697\">Twitter thread</a>. My intention was to shame Vodafone into action. I got more than I bargained for.</p> <p>Immediately, the responses started pouring in: first dozens, then hundreds of people sharing similar and sometimes even worse experiences when trying to cancel accounts with Vodafone, especially the accounts of people who had died or whose capacity had diminished. They reported, while in the depths of grief, the same nastiness and lack of sympathy. They reported an insistence on questioning vulnerable and confused elderly people. They described months, in some cases years, of failure to cancel such contracts. One woman who contacted me said she was still paying £78 a month to Vodafone for the phone of her daughter, who was murdered more than a year ago, despite sending them the death certificate and newspaper clippings.</p> <p>Many told me they had also been referred to debt collectors when they stopped their direct debits. Some then discovered, often much later and at crucial moments (such as when trying to buy a house), that their credit rating had been damaged, and they could not proceed until it had been resolved.</p> <p>A remarkable number of people reported that call handlers insisted on speaking to the deceased account holder “because only the account holder can cancel the account”. Some of the responses were grimly funny: people asked the company whether it could supply a medium or suggested exhumation. Other people related similar treatment by a range of phone, finance and utility companies.</p> <p>When our story went public, Vodafone couldn’t move fast enough. After it had checked the details, it cancelled the contract in the course of a two-minute phone call, later the same day. It shows it can be done. It failed to call off the debt collectors, however, who continued to ring my dad until we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/1547617233160982530\">publicly complained again</a>.</p> <p>Vodafone did not deny what happened to us. But nor did it respond as I’d hoped. Without consulting me, it issued a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VodafoneUK/status/1546943923699982337\">public apology</a> to my family for its “errors” and sent me links to information available on its website about cancelling contracts after a bereavement. I found it hard to see this pattern of behaviour, suffered by so many, as “errors”, not least because this isn’t the first time such practices have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/dec/02/my-mother-has-dementia-but-vodafone-wont-cancel-her-mobile\">brought to the company’s attention</a>. Nor did I want an apology only for my own family, but for all the people who had been treated this way. Above all, I wanted action.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VodafoneUK/status/1546943923699982337\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Please accept our apology <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GeorgeMonbiot</a> and we promise to address the errors made. <a href=\"https://t.co/g695sS7UvA\">pic.twitter.com/g695sS7UvA</a></p>&mdash; Vodafone UK (@VodafoneUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VodafoneUK/status/1546943923699982337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 12, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I asked for a call with the chief executive, and was offered a face-to-face meeting, which will happen in September. I have sent the company a list of <a href=\"https://www.monbiot.com/2022/07/25/my-demands-of-vodafone/\">21 demands</a>, ranging from joining a one-stop service to compensation for people who have been unfairly charged and wrongly pursued by debt collectors. I won’t stop till they have all been met.</p> <p>When I asked Vodafone whether it had a strategy of exploiting bereaved families, it replied: “We do not have a policy of making it difficult for bereaved families to get in touch with us to cancel contracts.” It also told me: “We are conducting a full-scale review and have refreshed the training we provide to our customer care colleagues.”</p> <p>I don’t bear grudges. I would be happy to help Vodafone turn its performance around. But, if the company fails to make the necessary changes, I will not stand by and watch.</p> <ul> <li><p>George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/28/gordon-copelands-family-handed-a-post-it-note-by-police-with-search-location-inquest-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Gordon Copeland’s family handed a Post-it note by police with search location, inquest hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/gordon-copelands-family-handed-a-post-it-note-by-police-with-search-location-inquest-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/gordon-copelands-family-handed-a-post-it-note-by-police-with-search-location-inquest-hears","fields":{"headline":"Gordon Copeland’s family handed a Post-it note by police with search location, inquest hears","trailText":"Gomeroi man’s family tells inquest they felt disrespected throughout search process after he went missing in a Moree river in 2021","byline":"Sarah Collard","body":"<p>The family of Gordon Copeland have told an inquest they were given a Post-it note by police with information about where to look, and felt disrespected throughout the “hurtful, heartbreaking” search for their loved one, after the Gomeroi man went missing in a Moree river.</p> <p>Lesley Fernando, Gordon Copeland’s aunt, gave emotional testimony on Thursday, telling the inquest the Copeland family had waited desperately for information for hours the morning after his disappearance.</p> <p>Copeland drowned in the Gwydir River in the early hours of 10 July 2021.

Its protagonist, friendless twentysomething Danni Sanders (Zoey Deutch), works as a photo editor at a Refinery29/Buzzfeed-esque digital media company called Depravity. Her bedazzled phone is totem, oracle, companion – she clutches it near constantly, pecks at it listlessly in her dark Brooklyn apartment. With her two platinum hair streaks and candy-colored rings, Deutch, who is also 27, looks like a Zoomer, and Danni calls herself a “zillennial”, but her obsession with social media perfection and becoming a New York writer feel distinctly millennial.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvby6Z0vWmA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xvby6Z0vWmA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>To the even somewhat online, Shephard’s screenplay will recall a number of late-2010s viral phenomena, mashed up and rearranged into an original story which feels like Spotify radio – smooth, vaguely derivative, the enjoyment dependent more on familiarity than insight. Like the notorious internet celebrity Caroline Calloway (who appears briefly as herself), Danni is the child of rich parents who aspires to writing success without actual writing. Like Anna Delvey, the so-called “Soho grifter” who inspired the Netflix series Inventing Anna, Danni spins a web of intricate lies that win her fawning friends and, eventually, widespread scorn.</p> <p>Like Aubrey Plaza’s Ingrid in Ingrid Goes West, Danni is a talented mimic primarily motivated by obsession: first, with co-worker Colin (Dylan O’Brien), a weed influencer whose style – bleached hair, ambient vape cloud, Black slang-inflected speech – riffs on the internet thirst for e-boy dirtbags a la Pete Davidson. In order to impress him and spite more successful co-worker Harper (Nadia Alexander), Danni invents a writer’s retreat in Paris and photoshops her glamorous time abroad. As in Dear Evan Hansen, Danni’s silly and somewhat sympathetic lie escalates into an unforgivable, attention-grabbing one after a traumatic event: a fictionalized terrorist bombing in Paris that kills dozens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/19/overshare-are-there-any-good-films-about-social-media\">Overshare: are there any good films about social media?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unable to admit that she was never there, Danni barrels ahead: “Im ok and safe. I don’t have reliable service yet but please know I am alright. Devastated for those who are not,” she posts on Instagram stories. At a support group to bolster her story, Danni meets her second fixation, Rowan (an excellent Mia Isaac), a teenage school shooting survivor turned heralded activist, a la the Parkland survivors of March for Our Lives. Craving Rowan’s celebrity, genuine purpose and preternatural talent, Danni channels Rowan’s trauma into a viral article, a hashtag, and false clout.</p> <p>Danni is, clearly, not a person to root for, and it is a testament to Deutch’s bubbly yet grounded performance of anxiety that we care to see her growth, whether in the inevitable comeuppance or the seeds of an actual bond with Rowan. But Not Okay as a whole struggles with what to make of Danni’s house of cards, other than to illustrate that she can build them, that these things happen, that (surprise!) the desire for validation and main characters can breed a vampiric kind of fame. As in, say, a scroll through Twitter, Not Okay occasionally hits a nerve – the mini-thrill of the half-second between hitting post and your story hitting Instagram, the dopamine hit of a like with a blue checkmark next to it, the anxious weight of the “seen by” list. A scene in which Colin hooks up with Danni and uses her famous victimhood as dirty talk got under my skin. Danni’s confused mix of feelings toward Rowan – envy, concern, greed, loyalty – are a heightened version of the parasocial bonds formed through the Instagram portal.</p> <p>But these moments are undercut by the film’s looseness of tone and time, at odds with the fanged boldness and timestamped specificity of the online. Not Okay feels very 2019 but is set vaguely in the present – or at least, a time when everyone is always in the office, no mention of the pandemic. At times, it veers into blunt satire of a performative woke, clickbait-y workplace (“Depravity would be honored to give you a platform,” Danni’s editor says when she learns of Danni’s story). At others, it somewhat successfully parses the difference between Danni’s pathological narcissism and anxiety, which is less successfully, often uncomfortably, leveled with the actual trauma of a Black teenage shooting survivor.</p> <p>It’s only at the moving end, which hands the mic to Rowan, that Not Okay settles on something sharp, resisting a tidy redemption arc for Danni and suggesting something beyond an artfully arranged, well-acted pastiche. Not Okay is like many “internet movies” before it – approaching uncanny valley, somewhat obvious, just a little off — but this unsettling darkness makes it a solid entry into the canon of just-okay social media films.</p> <ul> <li><p>Not Okay is out on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK and Australia on 29 July</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
