A typical family would save £1,000, he claimed.</p> \n  <p>He said: “Britain’s cost of living crisis is getting worse, leaving people scared about how they’ll get through the winter. Labour’s plan to save households £1,000 this winter and invest in sustainable British energy to bring bills down in the long term is a direct response to the national economic emergency that is leaving families fearing for the future.”</p> \n  <p>Starmer said the plan would cost £29bn over the winter and that it could be funded by extending the scope of the windfall tax on energy companies (raising £8bn), halting the proposed £400 payments for all households offered by the government to compensate for the price cap rise scheduled for October (saving £14bn), and lowering government interest payments on debt (saving £7bn), which Labour said would be possible because its plan would reduce inflation.</p> \n  <p>Last week Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, and Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, called for the energy price cap to be frozen at its current level and released plans explaining how this could be funded.</p> \n  <p>This led to criticism that Starmer, who was on holiday at the time, was letting them, rather than the Labour leadership, set the agenda.</p> \n  <p>Starmer’s plan was released as it was reported that Boris Johnson was on his second foreign holiday of the summer. He was photographed with his wife, Carrie, in a town near Athens. Earlier this month the couple had a break in an eco-hotel in Slovenia.</p> \n  <p>The energy price cap is now set at £1,971 and it is expected to almost double in October, with a further increase expected in January. Economists and charities have said millions of households will be plunged into poverty as a result, or left unable to pay.</p> \n  <p>The government has not proposed suspending the energy price cap rise, but it has announced an array of measures intended to help people pay their bills, and Johnson has said he is certain that his successor will offer more help in the autumn.</p> \n  <p>But neither Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and frontrunner in the contest to replace him, nor Rishi Sunak, her rival and the former chancellor, are calling for the energy price cap to be frozen.</p> \n  <p>And although both of them have signalled that that they would offer extra cash support to households, neither have proposed a full plan to fund this other than through extra borrowing. Truss maintains that her real priority is cutting the tax burden.</p> \n  <p>Read more from my colleagues Andrew Sparrow<em> </em>and<em> </em>Phillip Inman here:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax\">Labour announces plan to freeze energy price cap with reinforced windfall tax</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fa05388f086d0d751f1ad5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-15T08:35:56.811Z\">9.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Brandon Lewis played down suggestions that Boris Johnson has “thrown in the towel” after reports emerged at the weekend that he was on his second holiday in two weeks.</p> \n  <p>The former Northern Ireland secretary told LBC: “Even when you are not in the office in Downing Street you are working.”</p> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He’s probably in about his second week [of] holiday in the last year or so certainly this year.

A new film lets students investigate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s a school assembly, and the students – overwhelmingly Black and brown children from the city’s South Side, kindergarten through eighth grade – pack benches in the cafeteria. Two of the older students perform a welcome march; the trombonist plays fine, but the clarinetist is wildly squeaky, every note off. You would expect his peers to laugh – middle school is not renowned for being a forgiving place. But the students are quiet. When the music teacher asks the clarinetist to try again, they clap in encouragement. After another squeaky run-through, the principal takes the stage and reframes the potentially embarrassing moment into a strength: “It took a great amount of courage for them to try and try again and persist.” The students give a standing ovation.</p> <p>Their encouragement, the general camaraderie of the scene, is surprising and heartwarming – emblematic of a warm community and the clear-eyed film capturing its mosaic. National Teachers Academy (NTA) is, in intangible ways like the school assembly and on paper, a standout elementary and middle school. Opened in 2002, NTA had become one of Chicago’s best public schools, one of the very few to be high-percentage minority, high-percentage low-income and also have the district’s top performance rating. Yet despite its success – a rare beacon for Black students in the Chicago public school system – the district announced, in spring 2017, a plan to transition NTA into a high school that would serve predominantly white families that had moved into Chicago’s gentrifying South Loop neighborhood.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExDDP62L3p0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExDDP62L3p0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>National Teachers Academy “should have been a model for public education, especially at an elementary level and especially for Black and brown students,” said Kevin Shaw, the film’s director. “It should have been celebrated, and not thought of as being closed and discarded.”</p> <p>The community at NTA – students, administrators, volunteers, parents, alumni – refused to accept that plan. Let the Little Light Shine follows a remarkable movement: a group of people, some white and some Black, upper-middle-class and low-income, advocating for Black children’s futures. Similar to Shaw’s work as a segment director and cinematographer on Steve James’s excellent Chicago-set docuseries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/03/city-so-real-steve-james-film-docuseries-chicago\">City So Real</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/24/whats-it-like-to-be-black-in-chicago-high-school\">America To Me</a>, which embedded for over a year in the city’s diverse Oak Park River Forest high school, the 81-minute film illuminates the country’s stratifications through a single enclave in America’s third-largest city, with a memorable cast of characters. It weaves from classroom to district boardroom, a student’s kitchen to City Hall, meetings for the conversion of NTA and against. In doing so, it delves into the thorny politics of gentrification – the sanitized language of displacement, who and what is lost in the name of growth.</p> <p>Looming over NTA’s prescribed demise was Chicago’s fraught history of school closures. Shaw opens Let the Little Light Shine with a black-and-white title card: “In 2013, 49 elementary schools were closed in Chicago – the largest mass school closing in America.” Another title card: “The majority of those closings occurred in Black and Latinx neighborhoods.” The first scene is a protest outside Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s spacious, manicured lawn: “keep our schools open!” Most of Chicago’s public school closures had been schools deemed too under-attended or under-performing; NTA was neither. But it was majority Black, in an area with shifting demographics and some political clout in the form of the Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance, formed by the South Loop’s most affluent families to advocate for a local high school.</p> <p>The fact that NTA, a majority Black school, was seen as disposable, its campus more useful as a high school, had clear roots in the city’s long history of racial discrimination. “There was this very ugly undercurrent in this whole conversation that an all-black classroom cannot be smart. It is not an educationally viable classroom. It can only be good if it’s integrated,” Elisabeth Greer, an NTA parent leader, legacy of HBCU (historically black colleges and universities) students, and one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit to prevent the city from closing NTA, says in the film. “You’re saying that we’re not good enough, we’re not smart.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2107555577352a023ecded236313641ae3a9dbfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2107555577352a023ecded236313641ae3a9dbfb/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Let the Little Light Shine still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Still from Let the Little Light Shine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Argot Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shaw, a Chicago native, first heard of NTA through Greer, an elementary school classmate who posted about her fight to save the school on Facebook. Over the course of filming, Greer, a self-described quiet person, becomes a disruptor; in one scene, she uses her position on an advisory committee to sneak in middle school students, to make sure board members hear from NTA kids. Several of those students later protest at City Hall and speak before Chicago’s city government, impressing the South Side Chicago native and public school advocate Chance the Rapper, who appears in the film. Motivated by NTA’s cohesiveness and their steadfastness, Chance attempts to visit NTA, but is blocked by Chicago Public Schools administrators without explanation.</p> <p>Greer welcomes viewers into the campaign to save NTA, but Let the Little Light Shine is an ensemble film, a clear community from administrators like the principal, Isaac Castelaz, whose job is repeatedly threatened by the district, and former principal Amy Rome; elementary school students stressed about feeling included by their peers, or getting good grades; older students determined to have their love for NTA heard; school bastions such as security guard JP, the unofficial “mayor of NTA”, and Audrey Johnson, a volunteer parent and staff member and vital link to the Harold Ickes public housing project which neighbored the school before it was demolished. “These are people who should be uplifted,” said Shaw, “and you try to explain that to folks on that district level and sometimes it’s just going to go in one ear and out the other, and not really seeing the value of what’s going on, because they’re thinking the big picture of trying to get their school action passed.”</p> <p>Shaw reached out to Chicago Public Schools about filming, but did not hear back. So he instead worked with NTA administrators, particularly Castelaz, who saw the film as an opportunity to preserve and share NTA’s story. The NTA community was open, but it was “very hard” to get parents from the South Loop area to talk. “This neighborhood is very stratified, unfortunately,” said Shaw. “People don’t feel comfortable talking about these things, don’t feel comfortable talking about issues.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e65530bb4ab8331c0c4f9deba14c22d4e5fd495d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e65530bb4ab8331c0c4f9deba14c22d4e5fd495d/93_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Let the Little Light Shine still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hallway scene in the film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Argot Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, his crew worked out interviews with two local power brokers, John Jacoby and the PDNA president, Tina Feldstein. Neither present as explicitly anti-Black or anti-NTA, but their attitudes toward a majority-Black school emerge through euphemisms (both were interviewed by a white female field producer, according to Shaw). Jacoby refers to changes at South Loop Elementary, a majority-Black school that his daughter attended in the early 2000s, saying, “once we were able to institute proper decorum … the children took to it.” A discarded plan to ameliorate overcrowding at South Loop by sending some students to NTA included separate entry and exit times, separate recesses, separate entrances – “every measure that they could take where their kids would not be at all mixed or merged with the NTA students,” according to former principal Amy Rome.</p> <p>The motivations weren’t lost on the students. As NTA eighth-grader Taylor Wallace puts it in one of many scenes in which the students emotionally process the upheaval: “It’s the fact that they are turning a majority-Black level one-plus school into a high school. That’s basically saying ‘I have this power. I can take what I want without anybody doing something,’ which really makes me mad.”</p> <p>Greer’s lawsuit, and the community’s fight to keep NTA open, eventually goes to court. The outcome is public information, but I am loth to spoil it, as the film’s final scene is one of the most genuinely suspenseful and moving that I’ve seen in a while.

BookTok can be credited with a number of hits, sometimes reigniting interest in older titles such as the 2016 novel It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover (dubbed “CoHo” by TikTokers) which was launched back into bestseller charts after BookToker Aliisha Keens posted about it in March. Other books that have proved popular include Ocean Vuong’s On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, Red, White &amp; Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston and Beach Read by Emily Henry.</p> <p>TikTok estimates that the BookTok hashtag has had nearly 65bn views to date, and described it as “one of our most active communities”.</p> <p>The platform has now launched a book club in the UK, described as a new way for the “vibrant community” of book fans on the app to “share their love of reading”.

The challenge has partnered with a number of BookTok accounts, and operates in a similar way to the TikTok Book Club.</p> <p>The TikTok Book Club will discuss a new book every month throughout the summer and beyond, with discussions being led by five “BookTok Laureates”.

Goldgrub has warned that creators will have to be careful to remain authentic in the face of publisher partnerships for the book club, while Rycroft said that it was crucial that Waterstones “got the tone right”.</p> <p>“The joy of TikTok is how democratic it is,” said Rycroft. “The #Booktok community know what they like (and what they don’t) and authenticity is everything.”</p> <p>TheLibbyRuth said that “TikTok is for consumers”. They added: “While I enjoy content created by businesses, I think the best part about TikTok is the authentic and unpolished aspect of it, and I would hate to see it become overly commercialised, especially with the lack of diversity in publishing.”</p> <p>Goldgrub said that she would only feature titles from a potential partnership between TikTok and a publisher if “I were able to read the novel in advance to ensure it isn’t problematic and that I would recommend it even if I weren’t part of the official TikTok Book Club”.</p> <p>“Trust,” she said, “is <em>the</em> currency of the internet.

We are greatly relieved that this has enabled him to receive professional support and restart the treatment he has desperately needed for the past two years.</p> <p>“As a family we now wish to be given the time and space to grieve, to process events and to find a way of living without Kim – our much loved husband, father and brother. We shall continue to love and support Dan.”</p> <p>Swansea crown court heard Dan Harrison had been detained under the Mental Health Act at Neath Port Talbot hospital 10 days before the assault because of “severe” aggression towards his parents. His mental health had been deteriorating since 2018 and he had stopped taking his medication.</p> <p>He fled the ward on the afternoon of 12 March this year when a nurse opened a secure door. He barged past, ran from the hospital and took a taxi to Clydach before walking to his parents’ home and carrying out the fatal attack.</p> <p>Harrison told police his father had caused him “trauma” and he had punched, kicked and stamped on him.</p> <p>The judge said: “It is clear that Mr Harrison has been suffering for some 15 years from paranoid schizophrenia. That led to the forming of deluded beliefs about his father. It led to a significant abnormality of his mental function as a result of serious mental illness. His persecutory delusional beliefs extended to a wholly irrational concern for his mother’s safety.”</p> <p>He added: “It may well be that Mr Harrison will never in fact be considered sufficiently safe to return to live in the community.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Swansea Bay University Health Board said: “It is important that a thorough review of the circumstances leading up to Kim’s tragic death is carried out.

Sympathy should come first. The second remains controversial. Sticks and stones may break your bones, but what of “words can never hurt you”? Witness the Iranian government’s blaming of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/15/iran-says-salman-rushdie-and-supporters-to-blame-for-his-attack\">Rushdie himself and his supporters</a>. It is he, not Iran, that lies hurt.</p> <p>Freedom of speech is one of<strong> </strong>the most slippery concepts in political philosophy. John Stuart Mill pronounced it absolute but qualified it, as he did all liberties, where it causes “harm” to others. On that tenuous footing has grown an edifice of laws on slander, libel, incitement and, more recently, the causing of offence.</p> <p>The grim reality is that too many appeared to support the fatwa on Rushdie, whether out of personal affront at his writings or out of loyalty to their religion and its leaders. <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salman-rushdie-author-of-the-satanic-verses-no-stranger-to-deaths-threats-violence/articleshow/93528152.cms\">Two dozen countries</a> banned Rushdie’s book The Satanic Verses. Collective anger at a probably unread novel was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/world/asia/rushdie-attack-japanese-translator.html\">then elevated</a> into extremist violence – a situation not dissimilar to the 2015 Paris killings associated with the Charlie Hebdo cartoon.</p> <p>When offence passes beyond its individual victim to their identity group, it moves from the realm of personal grievance to that of collective revenge. Under the Blair and Cameron governments, ideas of offence, bullying and hatred were elevated to the status of crimes. Now, any chance remark by an offender might be broadcast to the world, often generating a synthetic sense of group affront and possible litigation, if not direct action. Its ultimate absurdity was the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-56154542\">inaccurate warning</a> on a Merseyside police advertisement that, “Being offensive is an offence”.</p> <p>The latest venture by the state into this morass is the Johnson government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/13/online-safety-bill-tories-free-speech-david-davis\">online safety bill</a>, with its bizarre concept of “legal but harmful”. However well-intentioned, it seeks to monitor an astonishing range of evils and indisciplines, from online stalking to incitement to riot, from phoney medicine to fake Russian news. How it will work has yet to be stated. It is a censor’s charter – or nightmare.</p> <p>Regulating the internet has become a major political challenge. Europe faced a similar crisis with the advent of printing, and evolved licensing and copyright laws to handle it. The key then lay in identifying the author and the publisher. There had to be some accountability for the words. In contrast, the internet has led to an anarchy of dissemination. While Rushdie has authored a book and is accountable for it, many of his critics are part of that familiar social media feature: an anonymous mob howling after its victim across the ether.</p> <p>Those worried by a lack of online accountability are convinced the only solution lies in somehow ending anonymity in that domain. Some claim anonymity helps whistleblowers and others – but such benefits are massively outweighed by the harm done by the unruly and unknown mob. The very fact that social media companies enjoy global accessibility should impose an added obligation on corporations to accept they are “publishers not just platforms”. Great as the technical problems may be, they must be held to account for the harm they can cause to others.</p> <p>This is the debate now thundering into view. The correct response to the Rushdie outrage is not just to plead for freedom of speech, but to ask what it really means and how it is to be sustained – and regulated. That is not done through silence.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist<br></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2022/aug/15/a-level-results-day-not-pain-free-head-of-ucas-says","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T15:50:35Z","webTitle":"A-level results day will not be ‘pain-free’, head of Ucas says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/15/a-level-results-day-not-pain-free-head-of-ucas-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/aug/15/a-level-results-day-not-pain-free-head-of-ucas-says","fields":{"headline":"A-level results day will not be ‘pain-free’, head of Ucas says","trailText":"Ucas, Ofqual and DfE hope to steady nerves as this year’s university admissions set to be among the most competitive in living memory","byline":"Sally Weale Education correspondent","body":"<p>The head of the universities admissions service has said this year’s A-level results were “never going to be pain-free”, as students are told to prepare themselves for lower grades and increased competition for university places.</p> <p>With results published on Thursday, the Ucas chief executive, Clare Marchant, said the government’s policy of reining in grade inflation in order to bring results gradually back to a pre-pandemic level, had been necessary but it was “not easy”.</p> <p>She was speaking after comments from leading figures in the sector that tens of thousands of students look set for disappointment this year, with 80,000 fewer As and A*s than last year according to one estimate, which could in turn result in 40,000 students or more missing out on their course or university of choice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/15/ive-been-a-wreck-students-on-facing-a-level-results-after-covid-disruption\">‘I’ve been a wreck’: students on facing A-level results after Covid disruption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ucas, along with England’s exams regulator, Ofqual, and the Department for Education, have sought to steady nerves before results day amid warnings that university admissions this year will be one of the most competitive in living memory.</p> <p>Marchant acknowledged the offer rate had gone down, particularly affecting applicants to the most selective universities and on the most popular courses such as medicine and dentistry. Given the changing circumstances, she said universities’ offer-making had been “precise, conservative and cautious”.</p> <p>It means, however, that many students whose plans have fallen through will be hunting for places via clearing later this week, having to consider different courses at different locations in order to secure their path into higher education. Some UK universities had just a handful or no courses at all available a week before results day.</p> <p>It is the latest setback for a cohort of pupils whose education has been severely disrupted by Covid-19, with two prolonged periods of school closures and cancellation of their GCSEs.</p> <p>The government and Ofqual introduced a number of exam adaptations, including advance notice of some topics, designed to mitigate lost learning, but even England’s higher education watchdog, the Office for Students (OfS), said students should be prepared for disappointment this Thursday.</p> <p>After record results last year, when 44.8% of grades were either A or A* at A-level, this is expected to fall to 35% (up from 25.5% in 2019). While almost one in five (19.1%) grades were A* last year, this year the proportion is expected to decline to 13.5%. Similarly, the number of A* to C grades are expected to go down from 88.5% in 2021 to 82%.</p> <p>“Ofqual wants to bring the grading down but if you compare that to – certainly what I’ve seen – some schools’ predicted grades, they have accepted that in general that results will go down but not necessarily for them,” John Blake, the OfS director for fair access and participation, told the Telegraph.</p> <p>“That could lead to a lot of students feeling quite disappointed on the day that their grades don’t match up to the grades that they were expecting. And I think it’s important for people to prepare themselves a bit for that and to acknowledge that.”</p> <p>Marchant told attendees at a webinar hosted by the Higher Education Policy Institute the good news was that record or near record numbers of students were likely to get into their first choice of university. But she said: “A return to either an intermediary position or, as Ofqual said, a midpoint, was never going to be pain-free.”</p> <p>She said it would be a busy time for clearing this week. As many as 40% of students are likely to make use of the system to secure last-minute places, and Marchant said there were 28,500 different courses available, including law and psychology.</p> <p>Marchant also said the years ahead were “not without risk”. Grades have been brought down this year to a midway point between pre-pandemic levels in 2019 and teacher-assessed grades in 2021, but next year’s grades will be brought down further to 2019 levels.</p> <p>Looking further ahead, she said a growing number of 18-year-olds in the population and an increasing demand for higher education, meant the higher education environment would remain highly competitive.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/15/adele-cancelling-las-vegas-shows-worst-moment-career","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T15:39:05Z","webTitle":"Adele: cancelling Las Vegas shows was worst moment in my career","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/15/adele-cancelling-las-vegas-shows-worst-moment-career","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/15/adele-cancelling-las-vegas-shows-worst-moment-career","fields":{"headline":"Adele: cancelling Las Vegas shows was worst moment in my career","trailText":"Singer tells of devastation and vows to ‘nail’ the rescheduled dates that will take place later this year","byline":"Nadia Khomami Arts and culture correspondent","body":"<p>Adele has said the decision to cancel her Las Vegas residency was the “worst moment in my career” and vowed to “nail” the rescheduled shows later this year.</p> <p>Speaking seven months after the dates were cancelled, the British singer-songwriter explained why she pulled out just 24 hours before she was due on stage.</p> <p>“There was just no soul in it,” she said <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/uk/\">in an interview with Elle magazine</a>. “The stage setup wasn’t right.

But for all the top-drawer entertainment served up by both sets of players in the oppressive London heat, the game was ultimately marred by the kind of post-match scenes no right-minded football fan wants to see.</p> <p>The kind of scenes on assorted Social Media Disgraces, where fans insulted, questioned the integrity of and occasionally libelled a referee who, a couple of minor oversights aside, had a largely excellent game. The kind of scenes where assorted Social Media Disgraces’ so-called refereeing experts demonstrated their lack of understanding of laws they want imposed rigidly by wailing – incorrectly, as it happens – that Chelsea should have got a free-kick for that Cristian Romero hair-pull on Marc Cucurella. Or that one of Tottenham’s goals should have been ruled out for offside, when they would be outraged if their own team had one chalked off in identical fashion. The kind of scenes that led to – at the time of writing – more than 70,000 tinfoil hat-wearing sheep blindly following a lead set by their team’s manager, signing a petition calling for Anthony Taylor, the official in question, to be forbidden from ever officiating a Chelsea match again. In time they might see the irony of complaining about biased officials, while simultaneously demanding the right to handpick their own favourites, but the early signs suggest today is not that day.</p> <p>Of course, there were also the kind of post-match scenes every right-minded football fan wants to see; specifically the minor 30-man stramash that ensued when Thomas Tuchel upset Antonio Conte with the intensity and vigour of h<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/14/engrossing-spectacle-ends-with-tuchels-and-contes-handshake-war\">is post-match handshake</a>. Going for the perfunctory no-look mini-clasp, Conte was rendered apoplectic when Tuchel grabbed his hand, refused to let go and came over all Strictly Jamie Redknapp as he forced the Italian into an unappreciated three-quarter turn while demanding he look him in the eye. Cue bedlam and red cards for both managers that mean they may have to sit out their respective clubs’ next dance routines.</p> <p>Given time to calm down, the pair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/aug/15/we-both-fought-for-our-clubs-tuchel-and-conte-reflect-on-touchline-clash-video\">played down the shenanigans</a> as they fulfilled their post-match media duties. Tuchel went so far as to raise his shirt-sleeve and flex his biceps for the ladies and gentlemen of the Fourth Estate, while later in the evening, his opposite number made light of the matter on Instagram. However, the German is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/fa-investigate-thomas-tuchel-chelsea-have-issues-with-referee-comment-football\">facing further disciplinary action</a> for suggesting “maybe that would be better” upon being asked if Taylor should be kept away from future Chelsea games. “But we also have VAR to help make the right decisions,” he added, lobbing in another insult but crucially providing a caveat that a good lawyer might just use to get him off the hook.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“You can’t have a tactical plan but then put it in the bin.

Surely that’s the only thing from which they don’t profit? Taxpayers pay £14.5m for new seating, plus another £5m a year for stewarding, while the club only pay £3m a year in rent.

We need it back into the system where it can be stored. We really need a long winter of rain to replenish this.”</p> \n<p>Robert Caudwell, the chair of the Association of Drainage Authorities (Ada), said the industry was concerned about surface water flooding but there was little it could do to help prevent it.</p> \n<p>He said: “The problem is that with thunderstorms at this time of the year it’s very difficult to predict exactly where they are, and our members have been holding as much water in their systems as possible to try to prevent things going dry, for the environment and farmers who want to irrigate.</p> \n<p>“So the last thing we want to do is what you would normally do if heavy rain was forecast, which is to build a bit more freeboard in by allowing more water to be taken out of the system, which is very difficult when you’re really unsure [which] areas will get a thunderstorm.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/dual-variant-covid-vaccine-approved-uk-booster-programme-moderna","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T15:19:47Z","webTitle":"Dual-variant Covid vaccine approved for UK booster programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/dual-variant-covid-vaccine-approved-uk-booster-programme-moderna","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/dual-variant-covid-vaccine-approved-uk-booster-programme-moderna","fields":{"headline":"Dual-variant Covid vaccine approved for UK booster programme","trailText":"Moderna jab designed to target original variant and Omicron has been given go-ahead by UK regulator","byline":"Nicola Davis Science correspondent","body":"<p>A vaccine designed to target two different forms of Covid will be offered as part of the autumn booster programme, after the jab was approved by the UK’s regulator.</p> <p>Manufactured by the US firm Moderna, the jab attacks not only the original coronavirus – as is the case for vaccines currently in use – but is designed specifically for the Omicron variant BA.1, which fuelled a wave of the virus in the UK last winter.</p> <p>The UK is the first country to approve the bivalent vaccine, known as “Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron”, giving the green light for its use as a booster for people over the age of 18.</p> <p>The UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the vaccine would be used in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/15/over-50s-in-england-to-be-offered-covid-booster-and-flu-jab-in-autumn\">planned autumn booster programme</a>.

What this bivalent vaccine gives us is a sharpened tool in our armoury to help protect us against this disease as the virus continues to evolve,” she said.</p> <p>Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, which independently reviewed the vaccine data, said the commission agreed with the MHRA’s decision, adding that the jab was able to lead to a broader immune response than the original vaccine.</p> <p><a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Modernas-Omicron-Containing-Bivalent-Booster-Candidate-mRNA-1273.214-Demonstrates-Significantly-Higher-Neutralizing-Antibody-Response-Against-Omicron-Subvariants-BA.45-Compared-To-Currently-Authorized-Booster/default.aspx\">According to Moderna</a>, trial participants who were given the bivalent booster had antibody levels against BA.4 and BA.5 that were 1.7 times higher than those given the original booster. These subvariants fuelled the most recent Covid wave in the UK, and have caused infections, breakthrough reinfections, deaths and disruption around the world.</p> <p>However, the difference is small and it is unclear what impact such a rise in antibody levels means clinically in terms of the protection offered by the jab. Nonetheless, the bivalent vaccine is expected to be no less effective than current jabs.</p> <p>The JCVI said that getting vaccinated is more important than focusing on the jab involved, with existing jabs having offered very good protection against severe disease for all Covid variants to date.</p> <p>“It is important that everyone who is eligible takes up a booster this autumn, whichever vaccine is on offer. This will increase your protection against being severely ill from Covid-19 as we move into winter,” said Prof Wei Shen Lim, Chair of Covid-19 immunisation on the JCVI.</p> <p>The autumn booster programme is focused on protecting those at increased risk from Covid, including people over the age of 50 and residents in care homes for older adults, with about 26 million people expected to be eligible for the jab. The Guardian understands the approach is an effort to move away from an emergency response to Covid in favour of a more targeted stance.</p> <p>The JCVI said it was preferable for a single type of vaccine to be used in the autumn booster programme, but it is not yet clear if this will be the bivalent Moderna jab or the existing booster jabs from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which the JCVI have also said can be used. In addition, the JCVI have said the Novavax jab can be offered as a booster. This is based on more traditional vaccine technology and can be given to people who cannot have the other booster jabs, for example because of allergies.</p> <p>Children who require a booster will be offered one of the current Pfizer/BioNTech jabs, at the appropriate dose for their age.</p> <p>Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, suggested the “Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron” vaccine may not offer huge gains in the fight against the latest Omicron subvariants.</p> <p>“We lack the certainties we had in early 2020 of which way to go with the vaccines, not least how to keep up with evolution of the variants,” he said.</p> <p>“BA.5 is highly immune-evasive, so that even boosted people have highly impaired protection. Even exposure to the original Omicron sequence – as used in this, new, bivalent vaccine booster – only gives a rather marginal advantage to the antibody response.”</p> <p>Altmann said that meant the outlook was complex. “We’re in a terribly vulnerable position heading into the winter, so any booster programme is better than nothing, and this bivalent booster almost certainly an improvement over the first-generation vaccines,” he said.</p> <p>“My view is that this approach offers a marginal improvement in our battle against BA.5, but actually, we still need to think harder about this and look more broadly at the diverse vaccine candidates. In the meantime, get boosted.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/15/boris-johnsons-summer-of-fun-what-has-the-pm-been-doing","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T15:18:39Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson’s summer of fun: what has the PM been doing?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/15/boris-johnsons-summer-of-fun-what-has-the-pm-been-doing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/15/boris-johnsons-summer-of-fun-what-has-the-pm-been-doing","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson’s summer of fun: what has the PM been doing?","trailText":"The prime minister is still in office but you could be forgiven for thinking he has already left","byline":"Rachel Hall","body":"<p>In three weeks’ time, Boris Johnson will no longer be UK prime minister.

It promises “healing energies” for its guests, with rooms costing between £242 and £541 a night. They have no electronic devices and wifi is available only upon request to enable people to “rest and unpack themselves from everyday worries” – possibly not the ideal setup for the leader of a country of 67 million people.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesperson refused to say if a Tory donor funded the trip, but insisted that no taxpayers’ money had been used.</p> <p>After his return on 11 August, following pressure – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/09/head-cbi-urges-boris-johnson-immediate-help-energy-bills\">including from the CBI chief executive</a> – to introduce immediate support to households struggling with soaring energy bills, Johnson made headline-grabbing news: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeeMelter/status/1557991300766617601/photo/1\">he turned up to a meeting</a>.</p> <p>However, hopes that one of his final appearances might produce a more compelling legacy than his ride in a Typhoon fighter jet to open Farnborough airshow on 18 July soon gave way to disappointment. Johnson declined to offer any new help on energy bills now, instead deferring responsibility to the new prime minister in September to provide extra financial support.</p> <p>For those wondering whether Johnson had taken the ensuing backlash to heart, he was spotted on Sunday. Not in a Westminster backroom with his two potential successors thrashing out emergency relief, but rather on his second holiday in two weeks, filmed shopping for groceries in a supermarket in Greece.</p> <p>Greek news websites reported that Johnson and his wife, Carrie, were in Nea Makri, a coastal town near Athens located a few hours away from where his father, Stanley, has a villa.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/bournemouth-abortion-clinic-seeks-protest-buffer-zone","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T15:13:03Z","webTitle":"‘More vocal, more aggressive’: calls grow for protest buffer zone at Bournemouth abortion clinic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/bournemouth-abortion-clinic-seeks-protest-buffer-zone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/bournemouth-abortion-clinic-seeks-protest-buffer-zone","fields":{"headline":"‘More vocal, more aggressive’: calls grow for protest buffer zone at Bournemouth abortion clinic","trailText":"Staff say protesters have been intimidating women outside the facility for years and things are getting worse","byline":"Aamna Mohdin","body":"<p>Thea Griggs found out she was pregnant the day before her 21st birthday, in 2018. In the days that followed, she was unsure of what to do. She had just left a difficult relationship and did not have the financial means to raise a child. Eventually, she decided to get an abortion.</p> <p>She booked an appointment with the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) in Bournemouth and was told of the different options before deciding to go ahead with the abortion. She was told she would be given one tablet, followed by a second a day or two later. After taking the first pill, she left the clinic and, to her shock, was met by six protesters. A woman approached her and handed her a leaflet. She ignored her and walked past. The group continued loudly praying. Some began to shout.</p> <p>“It was really intimidating. You’re in a really vulnerable situation and you have all these people shouting at you and saying you’re going to hell,” Griggs says. That night she struggled to go to sleep and wondered if she was a horrible person.</p> <p>Griggs is now one of many Bournemouth residents demanding that the council implement a protest buffer zone around the clinic so that other women do not have the same experience. “I spent a really long time thinking I made this awful decision and that I made a massive mistake, but at the end of the day abortion is healthcare. You wouldn’t stand outside a hospital and do this to any other patient seeking treatment,” she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"259231dee81fc7ca7ab0f735f5c94c401ce52156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/259231dee81fc7ca7ab0f735f5c94c401ce52156/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bournemouth BPAS clinic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The clinic is located in a residential area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zachary Culpin/BNPS/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid considerable local pressure, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council launched a consultation on the issue, which closes at the end of this month. If implemented, the council would follow in the footsteps of Ealing council, which implemented a buffer zone around a clinic in 2018.</p> <p>Caroline Brooks, a support services coordinator at BPAS Bournemouth, says there have been hundreds of cases like Griggs’s. She has worked in the clinic for more than 25 years and says that while there have always been protests, she believes they have become more hostile.</p> <p>“They’ve got more vocal, they’ve got more aggressive in their approach, and I think in some ways they’ve become far more rigid about their views and making sure that they impose those views on our people,” Brooks says.</p> <p>The clinic is situated in a residential cul-de-sac, a 10-minute walk from the station. A window of the building has had to be fitted with a special film so that protesters cannot peer in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a959f86fea447b08f347df20c5422dc12ac12f79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a959f86fea447b08f347df20c5422dc12ac12f79/0_251_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red files at the clinic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff have filled in complaint forms about protests over the years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zachary Culpin/BNPS/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brooks and her colleague Adele Warton, a client care manager, point to the nine red folders of testimonies they have been collecting since 2016 on the impact of the protests. Women have complained of being followed into the clinic or accosted when they leave. They have complained of being told “the baby loves them” or asked whether they know they “murder babies” inside the building. Protesters have stood in front of people’s cars. In one complaint, a client says: “When we walked past she said your baby wants to live. We drove for seven and half hours and did not expect this at all.”</p> <p>Staff have also filled in a number of complaint forms over the years. One worker says she has witnessed “many distressed clients”, including one who injured herself trying to climb a wall to avoid walking past the protesters. Another wrote that protesters have followed her to her car shouting “murderers”. In one of the most serious incidents, an individual dressed in a monk’s cassock followed a staff member along the street in the dark while recording her.</p> <p>The protesters are made up of a mixture of groups, but the regulars include 40 Days for Life, a religious anti-abortion global campaign that has its origins in the US, as well as members of local church groups. Some have brought plastic foetus models, pushed leaflets through car doors, called women and their escorts “mummy” and “daddy”, and hung baby clothes on a hedge.</p> <p>Warton fears the decision in the US supreme court to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/24/scotus-roe-wade-decision-what-happens-next\">strike down Roe v Wade</a> would embolden protesters. </p> <p>She says: “One of the crucial messages that I would have to give very distraught people who are sat in the waiting room is ‘I’m really sorry, but I can’t do anything about it. I can’t go out there and move them away. I can’t change this situation.’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1f6325e59a701d44fe157012cace9f190cd5fc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f6325e59a701d44fe157012cace9f190cd5fc4/0_339_5338_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adele Warton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adele Warton, a client care manager at the clinic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zachary Culpin/BNPS/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s for this reason that the campaign group Sister Supporters have stepped in. Set up in 2015, the group has teamed up with other local organisations across the UK, providing support for targeted clinics such as Bournemouth. The group has mobilised thousands to sign a petition calling for a buffer zone, and is now calling on people to respond to the consultation.</p> <p>Jess Bone, a volunteer for Sister Support Bournemouth, says: “They [the protesters] always say that they come with compassion and love. They’re coming with an alternative option. Generally, you’ve assessed the alternative option, which is birth, and having a child, and you’ve decided I don’t want to have that or maybe the pregnancy isn’t viable, so you’re going to abortion.</p> <p>“It’s that implied lack of trust that women know what they want. Even if you’re praying quietly and unobtrusively, women who go into the clinic know that they’re being judged.”</p> <p>Robert Colquhoun, the director of international campaigns at 40 Days for Life, argues buffer zones are a draconian overreach of power. “Many women are actually helped by pro-life outreach every year and this health advice is offered outside the abortion centre because it’s the place of need,” he says.</p> <p>Speaking about the allegations of harassment, he adds: “We’ve had hundreds and hundreds of accusations against us and many of those accusations have not been true over time.” He goes on to claim the group has “helped several women in Bournemouth who were scheduled for an abortion and chose not to go ahead with the abortion from that very centre”.</p> <p>Speaking from her office, which gives a view of the protesters, Brooks says much of her job is now taken up with avoiding protesters and gathering evidence.</p> <p>“I really shouldn’t have to do this to go to and from work,” she says. “We’ve reached the point now it’s just gone on too long. It should be stopping, not increasing.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/john-oliver-afghanistan-last-week-tonight","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T15:02:42Z","webTitle":"John Oliver: ‘Things are going worse in Afghanistan than you may know’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/john-oliver-afghanistan-last-week-tonight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/john-oliver-afghanistan-last-week-tonight","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver: ‘Things are going worse in Afghanistan than you may know’","trailText":"The late night host rang the alarm on the current state of Afghanistan a year after the US withdrew troops, highlighting a ‘grim but important’ topic","byline":"Guardian staff","body":"<p>John Oliver spoke about the “dire crisis” currently taking place in Afghanistan on the first anniversary of the US withdrawing troops.</p> <p>On his HBO show Last Week Tonight, the host looked back on the events of 2021, referring to it as “complete mayhem” with surprise all round from inside and outside Afghanistan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/08/john-oliver-monkeypox-us\">John Oliver on US handling of monkeypox: ‘On a scale of 1 to 100, we scored a no’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within days, the Afghan government was replaced by the Taliban, a devastating blow for the people.

Moyes wants a left-back to compete with Aaron Cresswell and is keen to secure a deal for Emerson, who is up for sale at Chelsea.</p> <p>Emerson, who has attracted interest from Atalanta and Forest, has had his path into the starting XI blocked by Ben Chilwell and Marc Cucurella. The Italy international spent last season on loan at Lyon. Chelsea have made it clear that they do not want Emerson, who joined them from Roma in 2018, to leave on loan again.</p> <p>West Ham are also looking for a central midfielder and an attacker. They had a bid for the Sporting Lisbon midfielder Matheus Nunes rejected last week and are interested in the Barcelona forward Memphis Depay, though he is expected to join Juventus. The Club Brugge midfielder Hans Vanaken is another Moyes target. The 29-year-old Belgian could give Moyes more options in attacking midfield.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/15/ricardo-dos-santos-iopc-review-case-athlete-stopped-by-armed-officers-met-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T14:51:39Z","webTitle":"Ricardo dos Santos: IOPC to review case after armed Met police stop athlete","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/ricardo-dos-santos-iopc-review-case-athlete-stopped-by-armed-officers-met-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/ricardo-dos-santos-iopc-review-case-athlete-stopped-by-armed-officers-met-london","fields":{"headline":"Ricardo dos Santos: IOPC to review case after armed Met police stop athlete","trailText":"London-based Portuguese sprinter says he feared for his safety during the stop – the third in last two years","byline":"Matthew Weaver","body":"<p>The police watchdog is to review how an athlete who has been repeatedly pulled over was stopped again, this time by seven armed officers, as he considers taking legal action.</p> <p>Ricardo dos Santos, a Portuguese sprinter based in London, said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/14/sprinter-ricardo-dos-santos-pulled-over-by-police-in-london-for-second-time\">released video of the incident in central London</a> on Sunday morning to show that young black people continued to face “over-policing”.

His spokesperson told the Guardian he was taking legal advice on whether he could sue the force.</p> <p>Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Dos Santos said nothing had changed since he and his partner, the British sprinter Bianca Williams, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/06/bianca-williams-athlete-stopped-by-met-police-being-black-is-a-crime\">stopped and handcuffed by the police in July 2020</a> in what they allege was an instance of racial profiling.</p> <p>Stop-and-search controversies were cited in June as one of the many scandals that led to the Met being placed under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/28/met-police-placed-special-measures-series-scandals\">special measures by the police inspectorate</a>.</p> <p>Dos Santos said: “My intention was purely for people to understand that even though the police have been put on special measures nothing has, or is, going to change.” He added: “My worry is that it is never going to stop. If people don’t talk about [it] especially people with a platform and a voice, it’s not going to stop.”</p> <p>In a statement on Monday, the Met said: “We have now recorded this matter as a public complaint. We have also referred it on a voluntary basis to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, recognising the public interest. We await their views on how they may wish to take this forward.”</p> <p>Dos Santos said his previous encounters led him to drive on to a more visible place when the police initially tried to flag him down on the M40 flyover in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p> <p>Defending his decision not to stop immediately, he said: “The flyover is pretty dark … For my safety and based on my previous incidents with them, I thought that the best place to stop would be somewhere lit up and with the possibility of witnesses. I didn’t fail to stop, I stopped where it’s safe to do so.”</p> <p>He added: “I was worried for my safety, because two years ago I also did nothing wrong. And I was dragged out of my car, and basically set upon by police officers.”</p> <p>When he stopped, five minutes later, Dos Santos was approached by seven armed officers in three police vehicles. He said the officers acted aggressively. One appeared to try to smash the window of his Tesla, and another tried to prevent him from walking in front of the car where he could be filmed by the vehicle’s dashcam, Dos Santos claimed.</p> <p>He said: “That whole environment of being set upon, I believe it was over-policing.”</p> <p>Police said a routine armed patrol called for further assistance after the car initially failed to stop on request.</p> <p>The Met confirmed Dos Santos was stopped over a suspicion that he was using a mobile phone at the wheel. He was allowed to go after a discussion with officers. Dos Santos said he showed officers his phone to prove he had not been using it. He said he stayed “as calm as possible”. He added: “It’s happened many times. So it’s my norm.”</p> <p>He said he did not deliberately film the incident, pointing out that his car recorded footage automatically. He said that after the incident in 2020 when his family was stopped driving a Mercedes with blacked-out windows, they decided to change vehicles. “I thought a family car would stand out a lot less,” he said.</p> <p>He said the car’s cameras made him feel safer, and one of the officers stopped behaving aggressively after being told the car had a camera. Dos Santos said: “You act differently when you know you’re being recorded.”</p> <p>Dos Santos has refused an invitation by the Met, posted on Twitter, to discuss the matter. He said: “I have passed it on to my lawyer. I’m not going to have direct contact with them.”</p> <p>After posting video of the incident on Twitter, Dos Santos has been criticised on the platform for failing to initially stop.</p> <p>Several anonymous accounts claiming to represent police officers were among those criticising Dos Santos. One post, purportedly written by a former firearms officer, accused him of trying to “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFOcop/status/1558793767498530816\">bait police to pursue anti-police agenda</a>”.</p> <p>Dos Santos said: “I don’t let the comments affect me.

It was found on the Yorkshire coast, north of Whitby.</p> <p>The new museum, in the Edwardian former head office of a steelworks, is small but has big ambitions.</p> <p>Hogg said the opening weekend had exceeded expectations, with people queueing down the street to get in.</p> <p>Once inside, visitors would have seen about 1,000 objects on display, including minerals and fossils found in the region – such as a mammoth tusk, a domesticated dog, a crocodile skull and the lower jaw of a 12ft plesiosaur.</p> <p>The museum stems from Hogg’s interest and passion for natural history, which he said had taken off in earnest over the past four years.</p> <p>While an economics student at the London School of Economics he would regularly hop between the British Museum and the Natural History Museum to feed his fascination for all things archaeology and palaeontology. “The libraries were always busy on campus so I just used to prefer to study there.”</p> <p>There are museums in the north of England that have natural history collections but, until now, there was no single northern museum dedicated to the subject.</p> <p>That was Hogg’s motivation for a museum in his home city, plus a desire for it to be a bona fide and useful research institution. “We have more laboratory space than gallery space, and we do have ambitions to move to a larger site,” he said.</p> <p>“It is such an interesting subject. It is such a fascinating concept – to actually understand life before human existence.”</p> <p>The museum opening was given a boost by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGPackham/status/1558727074608807936\">TV naturalist Chris Packham, who tweeted his support</a>, noting how cool it was that it was opened using a baryonyx claw.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/15/llanwddyn-lost-welsh-village-reappeared-drought","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T14:34:10Z","webTitle":"It’s back: the lost Welsh village that has reappeared in the drought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/llanwddyn-lost-welsh-village-reappeared-drought","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/llanwddyn-lost-welsh-village-reappeared-drought","fields":{"headline":"It’s back: the lost Welsh village that has reappeared in the drought","trailText":"As reservoir levels have fallen, Llanwddyn in Wales, flooded by a water company in 1880, has re-emerged – as have a Roman camp in Spain and an ancient city in Iraq","byline":"","body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> Llanwddyn</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Pretty old.

The price of a barrel of Brent crude for October delivery dropped by 0.8% to $97.36, while North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate dropped by 0.9% to $91.13.</p> <p>Chinese industrial production still grew, but it was up by only 3.8% on a year-on-year basis (slower than the 4.3% growth expected), whilst retail sales were up 2.7% year-on-year, significantly slower than the 4.9% expected rate. The data suggest that both industry and consumers may be reining in spending, while there were also signs that China’s property market is also struggling.

I grew up with parents who, in missing India, sought out other Indians, and so my notion of an Indian community was always diverse. When they invited other Indian families to our home, in the small Rhode Island town where I was raised, I realised that India was an elastic container of individuals who spoke, ate, dressed, and prayed in different ways. These differences did not “enrich” an otherwise homogeneous India; they were India. In that sense, India seemed light years ahead of the United States, which was a melting pot in name but alienating and provincial in practice, at least from my perspective. Visits to Kolkata, a city that, as my mother liked to point out, welcomed all of India’s populations, only confirmed my perception that India’s relationship with the Other was built into its very fabric. The plurilingual aspect of India, in particular, both inspired and consoled me, for it insisted on the need for ongoing communication and translation. The co-existence of more than one language generates curiosity, calls for interpretation, and subverts any notion of absolute power. Unravel certain threads, or snip some strands away, and the conversation is lost; we are left with a frayed society, with imposed silence, with banal and baleful notions of nationhood.</p> <p><em>Jhumpa Lahiri was born in London and grew up in the US to Bengali parents. She won the Pulitzer prize for her debut short story collection,</em><em> Interpreter of Maladies</em><em>, and is the author of three novels, including, most recently, </em><em>Whereabouts</em><em>, and two collections of short stories. She writes in English and Italian.</em></p> <p>***</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a25113ee2a1f14f1c8d63d80e3f8ac41e3969833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a25113ee2a1f14f1c8d63d80e3f8ac41e3969833/1523_0_2375_2969/800.jpg\" alt=\"Geetanjali Shree.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geetanjali Shree.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amarjeet Kumar Singh/SOPA Imag/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Geetanjali Shree</h2> <p><strong>Earthworms in Masks</strong></p> <p>The time was my childhood. Till recently it did not feel so very long ago, but, suddenly now, it does. Not because I have come a long way but because I feel I might be near the end!</p> <p>In that childhood would come a rare sound, a whirring, in the skies, in those days quite blue still. We would rush outdoors and look up. A machine with wings, flying far far above, flying far far away. To lands remote. To lands longed for. To lands never to be reached.</p> <p><em>Hawaijahaz hawaijahaz</em>, we children would shout.</p> <p>It was no whirring. It was stirring of our dreams and longings.</p> <p>Today. A whirr in the skies. The whirring as rare as in my childhood. The skies as blue. I don’t rush out but go with some weariness to the window, or to the balcony, my access to the outside during lockdown. I look up, a wee bit sadly, longing somewhat still, but dreams feeling a bit quashed. It is the same machine with wings, flying far far above, flying far far away, to places which had all come in my reach, but, may have gone out of my reach forever and ever.</p> <p>There was magic when the horizon was far. Possibilities were the stuff of dreams.</p> <p>But man was fast and confident and driven. He forged ahead. Became too fast, overconfident, ruthlessly ambitious.</p> <p>The collateral effects were to my pleasure. I got on to planes and crossed the horizon. I wandered in unknown lands. Dreams became reality.</p> <p>Everything became possible. Everything opened up. Everything lay under me. The trees of my childhood which gave shade to my house were now trees over which my house in a multistorey towered.</p> <p>Man, the master of all, friend to none.</p> <p>In the market. In global competition. In barrier-crossing. In the country, in the countryside, in the centre, in the margins, in the skies and the waters and ready to be so in space too.</p> <p>We shook up everything and felt good about it. I did too as I am the collateral beneficiary of this glittery, overhyped, overactive world. Ever increasing our pace.</p> <p>But shaking up everything meant Everything moved.</p> <p>That Everything was alive. We were not making an inanimate world move. We were shaking up the Animate. Earth. Air. Water. Planets. Mountains. Worms.</p> <p>Warnings came. Everything is shaking and us too with it and it will speed up. Speed thrills but also kills. But we believed in our immortality.</p> <p>It struck. The virus.</p> <p>In a flood a scorpion climbed up a swimmer’s shoulder and was being safely ferried across. Midway it stung its saviour, the very being saving it. But the scorpion was innocent. Stinging was its Dharma.</p> <p>So too the virus. It was merely fulfilling its Dharma to leap borders and infect bodies.</p> <p>Innocent.</p> <p>But man? His Dharma?</p> <p>And what of me, willy-nilly part of that erring man?</p> <p>How now and how much to slow down after getting addicted to speed? After flying galore, rending apart the atmosphere, how, and how much, to fold up my wings?</p> <p>The world had to run at our behest. We were not going to be dictated by a virus. We planned on gagging others, not ourselves.</p> <p>So are we the aliens and robots we thought we will make of you and control? Hey you, in front of me, behind that mask and in that three piece protective suit, are you human? Am I? No smile. No hug, kiss, touch, love!</p> <p>Move over humans, for the aliens and the Robots are upon us and are we them!</p> <p>I was sure I will escape even if you can’t!</p> <p>There was this earthworm which raised its head from the mud and stared at the disaster all around. He saw another earthworm doing the same. And said to the other – you stay stuck here, I am leaving for happier pastures.</p> <p>At which the second earthworm replied – idiot, we are linked, I am your other end! Where I stay there you do too, where you go there go I. But where is there to go?</p> <p>Here, he said, as if resolving anything, take this mask!</p> <p>So – no place to go and anyway planes are not flying and when they do it is not safe and us a bunch of earthworms, some heads, some tails, all in the same mess of overkill and overreach. In masks.</p> <p>That was then. Indeed planes are flying again and there we are flying in them as jubilantly as before. No slowing down, no reflecting on lessons to be learned, improving the world, we confidently believe again.</p> <p>Gandhi was not such a madman after all!</p> <p><em>Geetanjali Shree lives in Delhi and writes in Hindi.

Water companies currently leak around a quarter of their supply through old pipes, with 2,954m litres a day seeping away last year.</p> <p> “When the crisis hit, our water system was not ready”, Singleton-White said, blaming “the greed of the water companies, the weakness of the regulators and the complacency of the government”.</p> <p>Even some Conservative MPs are saying that the money water company bosses make is “unacceptable”. Former environment minister Rebecca Pow, who had water in her remit, said that the regulator should be taking stricter action and giving companies hefty fines.</p> <p>She told the Guardian: “These salaries are unacceptable if they can’t with a clear conscience provide clean, plentiful and sustainable water.</p> <p>“But this is also up to the regulator.”</p> <p>She added: “We also have the opportunity to charge the water companies 10% of their turnover in fines, so we should look into that.”</p> <p>Feargal Sharkey, the former Undertones singer who is now a rivers campaigner, agrees that the companies should face hefty fines, but pointed out that it is within government control to do this.</p> <p>He said: “What [the environment secretary] George Eustice needs to do is something the government has had the power to do for 30 years – put in place an enforcement order where they can legally demand that water companies do things exactly at the government’s choosing and when the government wants.”</p> <p>Sharkey added:“If water companies were losing 10% of their annual income, that would focus minds, wouldn’t it?”</p> <p>Campaigners have argued that privatisation is not working, as England is an outlier on the world stage with fully privately owned and run water companies that are increasingly criticised for not investing in infrastructure.</p> <p>The Green party is calling for water companies to be nationalised. Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton, said: “Water company bosses are taking home gigantic pay packets and gifting themselves obscene bonuses, and shareholders are raking in huge dividends – meanwhile, what the rest of us are getting in return is widespread water leakage, chronic under-investment and raw sewage dumped in our rivers.</p> <p>“The sooner we bring water companies back into public hands, the better. But that’s not enough – it’s now more urgent than ever to introduce legislation on pay ratios to enact the longstanding Green policy of ensuring bosses earn no more than 10 times the salary of the lowest paid in their companies, so that the grotesque inequalities in our society are finally tackled.”</p> <p>Eight of the 14 areas of England are now classified as being in drought, with hosepipe bans being implemented across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/hosepipe-ban-to-come-into-force-in-cornwall-and-parts-of-devon\">increasing areas of the country</a>.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/08/ban-bonuses-for-water-firm-bosses-until-they-fix-leaky-pipes-say-lib-dems\">called for the ban</a> on water company bonuses last week, and on Monday the party’s environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, told the Guardian: “Wealthy water company execs are profiteering off Britain’s rusting water infrastructure. They are handing themselves multimillion-pound bonuses whilst people this week had to queue up for bottled water in unbearable heat all because of a refusal to fix leaks. These are the very same execs who paid themselves massive salaries despite pumping poisonous sewage into our rivers.<br><br>“Ministers are just looking the other way whilst this scandal happens. You can’t trust this Conservative government to stand up for people and the environment. Instead, all they care about is keeping water company CEOs rich.”</p> <p>The Environment Agency recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/14/jail-water-firm-bosses-over-appalling-pollution-says-environment-agency\">called for water company bosses to be jailed</a> for serious pollution, after finding the water firms’ performance on pollution had declined to the worst seen in years.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Water UK, which represents the water companies, said: “Private investment has brought more than £160bn into an industry that was previously starved of cash while improving water company efficiency by over 70%. That efficiency means costs are lower, allowing bills to remain around the same for over a decade in real terms while still allowing new investment in resilience projects and reduced leakage.</p> <p>“Dividends in the last couple of years have averaged around 3%, in line with Ofwat’s expectations. Most companies last year either lost money or failed to achieve their base return allowed by the regulator.</p> <p>“We are hugely ambitious about the further projects needed to protect against climate change. We have proposed major, cross-country schemes – including reservoirs and grid connections – that will deliver enough new water for ten million people.

Here we take a look at how senior roles could shape up.</p> <h2>Cabinet ministers</h2> <p>One of the first big outriders for Team Truss, <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong>, is widely expected to become chancellor, and the pair have a far closer economic ideology than Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak ever had. <strong>Thérèse Coffey</strong> is Truss’s other dedicated cabinet loyalist and is expected to get a plum promotion, probably to the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>Other former leadership contenders including <strong>Kemi Badenoch, Penny Mordaunt</strong> and <strong>Suella Braverman</strong> are likely to get senior jobs, as well as <strong>James Cleverly</strong>, Truss’s number two in the Foreign Office, and <strong>Simon Clarke</strong>, a Boris Johnson ultra-loyalist who is now chief secretary to the Treasury and tipped to become business secretary.</p> <p><strong>Ben Wallace</strong> will be keen to stay at defence, while <strong>Brandon Lewis</strong> has done hard yards on the broadcast rounds over the summer defending Truss and will expect a promotion. Other newer converts to the cause may get demotions, such as <strong>Nadhim Zahawi</strong> and <strong>Sajid Javid</strong>.</p> <h2>New ministers</h2> <p><strong>Tom Tugendhat</strong> is likely to be the most prominent Truss backer who will go from the backbenches to a beefy ministerial job, perhaps even in the cabinet.</p> <p>Roles could also go to European Research Group members who gave Truss the group’s endorsement, including veteran Brexiter names such as <strong>Iain Duncan Smith</strong> and <strong>John Redwood</strong>, who have been tipped to get posts. Truss also has a clutch of ambitious 2019 MPs backing her who could get on the payroll, including <strong>Dehenna Davison, Mark Jenkinson </strong>and <strong>Brendan Clarke-Smith.</strong></p> <h2>Political team</h2> <p><strong>David Canzini</strong>, a former colleague of <strong>Sir Lynton Crosby</strong> who came into Downing Street under Johnson, is expected to remain in No 10. <strong>Ruth Porter</strong>, a public affairs veteran and co-director of Truss’s campaign, could get a key role in Downing Street. <strong>David Frost</strong> has routinely hinted he would like to work in a Truss-led Downing Street.</p> <p>Truss’s most senior communications adviser, <strong>Adam Jones</strong>, could become her director of communications, and a big job is also likely to go to <strong>Sophie Jarvis</strong>, the former head of government affairs at the Adam Smith Institute, who has been very close to Truss in her three years as a special adviser.</p> <p>Others who had key communications roles in the campaign include Truss’s press secretary, <strong>Sarah Ludlow</strong>, a former aide to Rory Stewart; <strong>Jason Stein</strong>, a former adviser to Truss and latterly to Prince Andrew and Amber Rudd; and <strong>Harry Methley</strong>, a former special adviser to Priti Patel.</p> <h2>Whitehall</h2> <p>Truss wants the Treasury’s permanent secretary, <strong>Tom Scholar</strong>, to move on if she enters No 10, according to the Sunday Times. A close Whitehall ally of Truss, <strong>Antonia Romeo</strong>, is tipped to take over and move from her role as permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice. Romeo became close to Truss at the international trade department. Another Truss ally who may get a promotion into No 10 is <strong>Sir Tim Barrow</strong>, her political director at the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Truss may want to take a fresh look at the recent Downing Street shake-up announced by Boris Johnson as a final roll of the dice, which created a separate role of No 10 permanent secretary, filled by <strong>Samantha Jones</strong>. Reviews of the new arrangement from insiders have been mixed to say the least.</p> <h2>Who’s out?</h2> <p>Allies of Truss have made it clear that <strong>Dominic Raab’s</strong> fierce attack on Truss’s economic plans have massively damaged his chances of remaining in cabinet. <strong>Priti Patel</strong> has steadfastly not endorsed either candidate and the chances are she will be offered a diminished role. <strong>Michael Gove </strong>has been described by allies of Truss as “serially disloyal”.</p> <p><strong>George Eustice</strong> and <strong>Steve Barclay</strong> are Sunak-backing cabinet ministers who may need to be eased out to make space. A return to the cabinet for <strong>Oliver Dowden</strong>, <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong> or <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> now looks unlikely. And after the leadership contest exposed deep divisions between Truss and <strong>Sunak</strong> on strategy, it is hard to see how the pair can put things back together.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/15/dating-app-tinder-online-meeting-people","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T14:00:30Z","webTitle":"I’m a dating app evangelist – but even I’m not on Tinder any more | Alex Mistlin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/dating-app-tinder-online-meeting-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/dating-app-tinder-online-meeting-people","fields":{"headline":"I’m a dating app evangelist – but even I’m not on Tinder any more ","trailText":"I loved the freedom of online dating – but discovered meeting people is no guarantee of building a lasting connection, says Alex Mistlin, a commissioning editor on Guardian Saturday","byline":"Alex Mistlin","body":"<p>I first joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jan/17/tinder-dating-psychology-technosexual\">Tinder</a> when I was 18. I was lonely towards the end of my first year of university and couldn’t believe that everyone was spending their summer revising in a library. I wanted to meet normal people – which seemed to irk my friends, who didn’t understand why I wanted to “date randos”.</p> <p>Their scepticism spurred me on. Deep down, they were surely jealous of the freedom Tinder granted. It wasn’t shameful – it was validating. There really were hot singles in my area, who, best of all, thought I was attractive and were kind enough to identify themselves. Since then I’ve been an evangelist for dating apps, constantly haranguing my friends to broaden their horizons and have a spin of the digital roulette wheel. </p> <p>Consider the alternatives. When Tinder was born a decade ago, I was 15. I’d never had a girlfriend and I already vaguely resented the fact that finding “the one” seemed to involve getting exceptionally lucky, or else waging a targeted campaign on a woman at her workplace, gym, cafe, or independent bookshop. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/09/how-we-made-the-inbetweeners\">The Inbetweeners</a> and Seth Rogen movies had made it clear you didn’t have to be toned, sophisticated, or even washed to get the girl, but it still seemed like a relentless tide of hard graft and rejection. Sure, dating sites existed but they were for weirdos and divorcees – and according to late 2000s tabloid hysteria were inundated with “child predators” and “Thai brides”.</p> <p>Despite what you may have been led to believe, people on dating apps are just like you and me. They just don’t know you yet, which for me, is a key part of their appeal. Who doesn’t want to begin a romance as the mysterious stranger, someone who gradually reveals their flaws rather than feeling the need to explain them away at the outset?</p> <p>This year, I’ve been on 20 first dates, the majority of them with women I met on apps. Some went badly but most went well – it’s fun pretending you have your life together for a few hours, and regularly scrubbing up and trying to put my best foot forward has been a form of immersion therapy after the lethargy and agoraphobia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/28/young-covid-rent-wages-end-pandemic\">of the final months</a> of the pandemic.</p> <p>But what of handing my romantic prospects over to an algorithm? Shouldn’t some things be done the old-fashioned way? Call me a cynic, but I long ago accepted that algorithms dictated my fashion sense and music taste (I’ve had Spotify since I was 11). Worrying about which partner the algorithm will deliver seems almost quaint now that lines of code determine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/16/jenrick-mutant-algorithm-win-localism-centralised-planning-u-turn\">where people live</a>, whether they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/feb/18/the-student-and-the-algorithm-how-the-exam-results-fiasco-threatened-one-pupils-future\">go to university</a> and <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/government-algorithms-benefit-fraud/\">who lives and who dies</a>. And hasn’t there always been an algorithm? We just called it fate or luck, while feigning ignorance of the role that race, class and geography have always played in romance. Really, marrying the boy you lived opposite in the first year of university should seem bizarre, not marrying the boy you carefully selected after considering 299 others.</p> <p>For all that dating apps enable the racist, misogynistic and superficial tendencies prevalent in society at large, my main reservation is that apps have given us too much choice. In the same way that I spend most evenings helplessly scrolling through Netflix (and Prime, Apple, iPlayer and Now TV) looking for something decent to watch, I am unable to commit to women, in the knowledge that there are so many to choose from. It’s overwhelming and exhausting. And as with the Netflix menu, the more time goes by, the less certain I feel about what I’m looking for. Meeting people has become the easy part – but there’s no app for building a lasting connection with someone.</p> <p>There’s nothing wrong with being indecisive, but it’s important to be honest with people – and yourself. Just because you can get someone else doesn’t mean you haven’t found someone great. And there’s a fine line between having the confidence not to settle and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/mar/29/how-ghosting-became-phenomenon-in-modern-dating\">ghosting</a>, flaking, <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/benching-dating-meaning#:~:text=%27Benching%27%2C%20a%20dating%20term,them%20to%20go%20much%20further.\">benching</a>, <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Breadcrumbing\">breadcrumbing</a> and just plain old treating people like shit because you can.</p> <p>I left Tinder a couple of years ago, when it seemed like the people I wanted to date were gravitating towards other apps. Now, you can find me on Hinge (another app under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/08/tinder-hinge-match-group-donations-abortion\">Match Group</a> umbrella), just one of the literally hundreds of apps promising to connect people according to their stated preferences. On a recent trip to the US I was bombarded with ads for BLK, an app tailored to “Black singles”, and I suspect my invitation to Raya, the dating app for celebs, is somewhere in my spam folder.</p> <p>By giving people agency and expanding their circle, apps have made it easier than ever to find love. But I hope people don’t become blind to chance meetings and spontaneous connections just because they have half a dozen matches waiting for them at home. We may have spent a decade getting pissed, going home and settling down with strangers but just because there’s nothing wrong with meeting “the one” on your phone, it doesn’t mean you have to either.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alex Mistlin is a commissioning editor on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/saturday\">Guardian Saturday</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Take what prime minister in waiting and foreign secretary Liz Truss put out to the Jewish community – a message she clearly believed to be supportive and vote-winning but was in fact <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/12/liz-truss-protect-british-jews-antisemitism-woke-culture\">reinforcing the most damaging tropes about Jews</a>. “So many Jewish values are Conservative values and British values too, for example seeing the importance of family and always taking steps to protect the family unit; and the value of hard work and self-starting and setting up your own business.” She added that “the British Jewish community is incredibly proud of this country and so are Conservatives”, and that she was determined to protect the community from “woke civil service culture that strays into antisemitism”.</p> <p>So that’s us Jews neatly classified. Conservative, business-minded, industrious, patriotic and anti-woke. Just like black people are great runners, Asian people are brilliant mathematicians and Yorkshire folk such as our Liz are careful with money … which takes us back to the Jews.</p> <p>As with many of Truss’s ill-judged comments this one begs questions. For example, which communities don’t see the importance of family and actively take steps not to protect the family unit? Truss used her statement of support for her idealised Conservative Jewish community to randomly attack civil servants and “wokeness” (defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as, horror of horrors, “Originally: well-informed, up-to-date. Now chiefly: alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice”).</p> <p>Truss’s blindness to her bigotry in this case might be because she likes Jewish people – or rather the ones she shares values with. The woman who loves to portray herself as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/aug/08/the-tory-leadership-race-and-the-ghost-of-margaret-thatcher-podcast\">Margaret Thatcher the Second</a> is like her hero a philosemite. In theory, that’s great. We should be philo-everything. The problem, though, is she likes her kind of Jew – and her kind of Jew is the exact same stereotype of someone that many antisemites dislike, cruelly caricature and, in the case of the Nazis, tried to obliterate.<br><br>When referring to Jewish and Conservative values, Truss may well be thinking of the Jewish men who played such prominent roles in the Thatcher governments. Nigel Lawson, Keith Joseph, Leon Brittan, Malcolm Rifkind and David Young were all senior ministers, the political analyst Alfred Sherman advised her, and she was hugely influenced by American free-market economist Milton Friedman. All these men had Conservative values (though Sherman had been a communist volunteer in the Spanish Civil War). But a coterie of like-minded thinkers does not a Jewish identity make. Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky and Rosa Luxemburg were also Jewish. No community, whether defined on racial, religious or sexual grounds, acts and thinks as one.</p> <p>To suggest the Jewish community is homogeneous is ignorant and offensive. There are many Jewish people like me who do not have Conservative or conservative values, are not entrepreneurs, do not need protection from “wokeness”, and rather than feeling proud of Britain, feel ashamed at the way this government has treated asylum seekers in need of refuge. Similarly, there will be plenty of Jewish people who share a mix of my values and Truss’s values.</p> <p>The most alarming aspect of Truss’s remarks is that it reinforces age-old stereotypes – the Jew as self-made in business, with all the attendant assumptions of wealth, privilege and meanness. The trope is at the heart of much left- and rightwing conspiracy theory – Jews control banks, Jews control Hollywood, Jews control everything.</p> <p>While for Truss the stereotypical Jew might be a role model, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2022/may/19/kilts-mohawks-and-plumbing-smashing-jewish-stereotypes-in-pictures\">for many others it’s anything but</a>. When I was at school, a related stereotype was attached to Jews, but as a term of abuse rather than a badge of honour. I was regularly told that somebody thought to be ungenerous was “tight as a Jew’s arse”. These kinds of stereotypes were all over literature too. Even those who hadn’t read a word of Shakespeare or Dickens knew about Shylock and his pound of flesh; and Fagin, the legendary miser, villain and Jew (in the first 38 chapters of Oliver Twist, Fagin is referred to as “the Jew” 257 times).</p> <p>Antisemites with a literary bent might think of Truss’s stock Jew as the repellant Bleistein in TS Eliot’s poem Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar. “On the Rialto once / The rats are underneath the piles / The Jew is underneath the lot / Money in furs.”</p> <p>And for those of us with a sense of none-too-distant history, Truss’s depiction of Jews as entrepreneurs may make us think of 1 April 1933, when the Nazis boycotted Jewish-owned businesses. On that day the Star of David was painted in yellow and black across thousands of doors and windows, with signs saying “Don’t buy from Jews!” and “The Jews are our misfortune!” In his will, written hours before his suicide in April 1945, Hitler referred to Jews as “international swindlers” and “the poisoner of all nations”.<br><br>Of course, Truss’s statement could not be more different in tone, sentiment or ideology (as it happens, Hitler associated Jews with Marxism rather than Conservatism). But the stereotype at the heart of it – that Jews, business and money go hand in hand – is identical and equally dangerous whatever the intention.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the Guardian</p></li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I am not surprised that this has led to many international reactions. Sometimes we have to make unpopular decisions.”</p> <p>Freya, named for the Norse goddess of beauty and love, had become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/freya-the-walrus-sinks-boats-and-captures-hearts-in-norway\">a popular attraction</a> since arriving on 17 July in the waters off the Norwegian capital, where crowds approached to watch as she basked in the sun or dozed on boats.</p> <p>Norway’s fisheries directorate said the walrus was euthanised “based on an overall assessment of the threat to human safety” after the public ignored warnings not to get too close to her, often with small children, to pose for photographs.</p> <p>Other reports showed people swimming with the walrus, throwing things at her, and surrounding her in large numbers. On one occasion police had to evacuate and seal off a bathing area after Freya chased a woman into the sea.</p> <p>The agency concluded that the “possibility for potential harm to people was high and animal welfare was not being maintained”. Its director, Frank Bakke-Jensen, said other solutions, including moving Freya elsewhere, could not guarantee her safety.</p> <p>“There have been too many dangerous situations,” he told <a href=\"https://www.vg.no/\">the Norwegian tabloid VG</a>, adding that while the agency understood the decision could “cause reactions with the public” he was “firm that this was the right call.

Opponents of the decision to euthanise her, which caused uproar on social media, said more should have been done to avoid it.</p> <p>Siri Martinsen of the animal rights group NOAH said onlookers should have been fined first, and the biologist Rune Aae told the Norwegian news agency it was “infinitely sad” an animal had been put down “simply because we did not behave properly with it”.</p> <p>Christian Steel of the environmental group Sabima <a href=\"https://www.nrk.no/norge/krev-a-fa-vite-kvifor-freya-blei-avliva-1.16067525\">told the NRK,</a> it was essential the directorate released full documentation on who took the decision to euthanise Freya, and on what grounds.</p> <p>“The directorate cannot keep this a secret just to make things convenient for itself,” Steel said. “They have a reason for it. There must have been professionals in the picture who have made an assessment that this animal was stressed.”</p> <p>Eivind Trædal, a member of Oslo city council, <a href=\"https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/Ead473/reagerer-kraftig-paa-freyas-doed-ingen-grunn-til-aa-avlive\">told VG</a> the decision to put the walrus down represented “a collective failure”, while Truls Gulowsen of the Nature Conservation Association called the decision “embarrassing”.</p> <p>People “behaved like idiots faced with nature”, Gulowsen said. “Elsewhere, authorities managed to keep them away, and people managed to show consideration. But here in Oslo fjord, no one could be bothered – so we kill it instead.”</p> <p>However, the zoologist Per Espen Fjeld <a href=\"https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/nW5gQL/biolog-mener-det-var-bra-at-freya-ble-avlivet\">told VG</a> on Monday it was “obvious” that Freya would have to be put down eventually, adding that the decision was entirely justifiable and had no consequences for the future of the species.</p> <p>“You cannot expect 1.6 million people not to swim in Oslo fjord,” he said. “People were out swimming and suddenly there it was, a metre away.

They benefited from the pollution that they put in our river. They made money off of our lives.”</p> <h2>Linked to cancer</h2> <p>Hexavalent chromium, also called chromium-6, is used in stainless steel production, electroplating and in the manufacturing of dyes, inks and surface coatings and other products. Research has linked <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/chromium-compounds.pdf\">chromium compounds</a> to lung cancer, liver damage, reproductive problems and developmental harm.</p> <p>The 2000 film Erin Brockovich brought chromium-6 to national attention, featuring the true-life tale of a legal assistant who discovered elevated rates of cancer and death among residents of Hinkley, California, were linked to the contaminant in their drinking water.</p> <p>Tribar said in a statement that the worker responsible for overriding its alarm system resigned from the company the day the spill was reported. State water regulators <a href=\"https://miwaters.deq.state.mi.us/nsite/site/520526042558246602/documents\">issued violations</a> and continue to press the company for answers, including why the employee was present at the plant when it wasn’t in production.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the FBI did not specify the scope of its inquiry, but <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/08/11/fbi-wixom-police-tribar-hexavalent-chromium-huron-river/10301169002/\">told the Detroit Free Press</a> that the agency can become involved in an incident involving a chemical leak when there is potential criminal activity. ​​</p> <p>The battle to keep hexavalent chromium out of drinking water is an effort that spans the nation. <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/chromium6_contamination/map/\">An interactive map</a> by the non-profit Environmental Working Group found chromium-6 in tap water serving 251 million people throughout the US, at levels scientists deem unsafe.</p> <p>The day of the spill, Tribar discharged its waste into the local sewer system, where it traveled to the wastewater treatment plant and out to the river.</p> <p>Testing indicates that chromium levels in the river are below levels of concern for effects on human health. Still, some may have settled in the river’s sediment and could later spread, said Jeff Gearhart, research director of <a href=\"https://www.ecocenter.org/about-us\">the Ecology Center</a>. While so far no samples from Ann Arbor have contained hexavalent chromium, Gearhart said it could take several weeks to a month for the contamination to reach the city.</p> <p>“We’re still concerned about the ecological impact of whatever did make it into the river and need a better understanding of what impacts that may have to the watershed,” said Gearhart.</p> <h2>‘The anger is palpable’</h2> <p>In 2018, Tribar was <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2018/09/astronomical_pfas_contaminatio.html\">responsible for releasing</a> waste containing harmful PFAS, or forever chemicals, into a nearby creek that feeds into the Huron River.</p> <p>Because of that contamination, signs were posted along the waterway to warn visitors not to eat the fish from the river. After the more recent discharge signs were once again erected warning visitors not to come in contact with the water on certain stretches of the river. The Michigan department of health and human services lifted that warning last week after concluding there was no health threat.</p> <p>“Our first reaction to the news was heartbreak and concern for public safety. But as we heard more and learned that Tribar was responsible – this polluter that had previously contaminated the entire river system with PFAS – that heartbreak morphed into anger,” said Daniel Brown, a watershed planner with the Huron River Watershed Council.</p> <p>“The anger is palpable,” Brown added. “For those of us that have been following these issues, there is really a fury in knowing that we have weak environmental laws, weak water protections that allow this to happen, and that we have a repeat offender in Tribar.”</p> <p>Bruce Heavner, owner of a canoe and kayak rental company in the area, recalled how he and staff <a href=\"https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/cancer-causing-hexavalent-chromium-spills-wixom-plant-huron-river\">rushed to retrieve paddlers</a> from the river when news of the spill broke. Heavner said business has dropped by 70% since the “do not contact” recommendation was issued, but said it wasn’t the most important concern.</p> <p>“Wildlife, the fish, the birds, the turtles and other animals that call our river home,” Heavner said. “If there’s a chemical in the river, what happens to them?”</p> <p>The Ecology Center and environmental advocates in Michigan have issued an open letter <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-use-of-toxic-hexavalent-chromium-in-vehicles-cd116461-2f52-4ec4-81a2-e3e16921d88a?recruiter=1273307120&amp;recruited_by_id=c8f96870-1759-11ed-bf02-9b652d395d2e&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard\">calling on automakers</a> to stop doing business with suppliers that use hexavalent chromium, including Tribar, arguing that the facilities endanger worker and environmental health and that safer alternatives are available and in use.</p> <p>Michigan once had among the strongest water protections in the nation. But McBrearty of Clean Water Action, which helped organize the rally, said Michigan began to gut polluter pay laws in the 1990s, which has meant consequences for bad actors amount to a “slap on the wrist” and leaves taxpayers on the hook for cleanup.</p> <p>“These companies don’t care about the health of the people that are exposed to these chemicals or the health of the river. If all you’re looking at is the financial bottom line, and it’s cheaper to pollute than it is to do things the right way, they’re going to keep polluting,” said McBrearty.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/15/covid-britain-politicians-pandemic-protective-measures","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T13:30:30Z","webTitle":"The threat of Covid isn’t over – so why does Britain have a conspiracy of silence about it? | Philip Ball","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/covid-britain-politicians-pandemic-protective-measures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/covid-britain-politicians-pandemic-protective-measures","fields":{"headline":"The threat of Covid isn’t over – so why does Britain have a conspiracy of silence about it?","trailText":"Our government is pretending that the pandemic is ‘done’, ignoring both protective measures now and preparations for the future, says science writer Philip Ball","byline":"Philip Ball","body":"<p>Remember those days of looking at graphs and statistics of Covid infections and deaths and wondering if the end of the pandemic was in sight, or if it was safe to visit the parents, or if another tranche of restrictions was on the way? Thank goodness someone is still keeping track of those figures – namely the World Health Organization, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/global-weekly-coronavirus-deaths-have-fallen-9-who-reports\">latest update</a> brings the welcome news that global weekly Covid deaths have dropped by 9%. All the same, the overall picture is complicated: deaths are rising in the Middle East but plummeting in Africa and declining more slowly in Europe and the Americas.</p> <p>We’re still in a pandemic, then. But unless you are in a hotspot, the chances are that you’re keen to move on, to return to some sort of normality while trying not to worry about all these symptoms of the climate crisis or the prospect of soaring winter fuel bills. For most of us (not, perhaps, the estimated 2 million or so in the UK living with long Covid) there are other priorities right now.</p> <p>To suggest, then, that Covid is still very much a live issue is hardly going to court popularity. But we are (for now) past the point of divisive arguments about masks and lockdowns. Rather, this is the stage in the pandemic at which it’s appropriate to take stock, to learn lessons – and maybe to start trying to process the grief and trauma of the past two and a half years.</p> <p>Covid, like Brexit, is conspicuous by its absence as a topic in the Conservative leadership campaigns, and partly for the same reasons: both are disasters that have exhausted everyone, and neither reflects well on those in power. There’s a sense that the Conservatives regard the pandemic as “done” in much the same way as Brexit is “done”: it’s in the past, it’s all fine, let’s move on.</p> <p>Thus ministers and ex-ministers insist – regardless of what scientific experts say – that we have exited the pandemic and that the virus is now endemic, like the flu. The peaks in infection rates in early January and late March were the largest ever, but they barely warranted a mention from politicians (the Partygate crisis was more urgent). Don’t worry, was the message: the vaccines (remember that amazing rollout, by the way!) will take care of it, notwithstanding the fact that <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/uk-cumulative-covid-deaths-rate\">one in four Covid deaths</a> in the UK occurred after they became available. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o562\">rapid dismantling of some of the UK’s Covid surveillance infrastructure</a> in the early part of this year was arguably even more alarming. In March, for example, the government<strong> </strong>announced it would stop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/dismay-as-funding-for-uks-world-beating-covid-trackers-is-axed\">funding</a> the Zoe app Covid tracking study and the React study which assesses levels of Covid infection across England. And while free lateral flow tests could not be distributed indefinitely, they were arguably withdrawn too soon (indeed, in the midst of the second-largest infection peak). There has been no careful thinking about how to ensure people on low incomes can afford to take Covid tests, so it’s likely to be the poorest people who will forgo a check before visiting elderly or vulnerable friends and relatives.</p> <p>It is precisely because countries are dropping their testing and surveillance capabilities that the WHO has cautioned that its latest figures may not be as reliable as previous data. Right now, we should be doing precisely the opposite. “We need surveillance to up its game inside countries and [in] collaboration between countries,” says Ewan Birney, director of the European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge.</p> <p>The current political habit of moving on from anything awkward means we are still not dealing seriously with the ongoing complications of Covid. This is not now about personal “freedoms” – the constant refrain in a <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-10545097/MATT-HANCOCK-Freedom-Day-hard-won-resist-dangerous-slide-against-liberty.html\">misinformation-strewn article</a> by Matt Hancock in February – but about future preparedness. Ventilation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewanbirney/status/1557287697575809024\">needs to become a priority</a> for building codes in hospitals, schools and public places. “Simple air exchange is effective in dramatically damping infection,” says Birney. By improving ventilation, he says, we won’t just reduce Sars-CoV-2 transmission; we’ll also reduce the majority of other airborne viruses, too.</p> <p>The Covid public inquiry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/public-inquiry-into-uk-covid-19-response-opens\">now getting under way</a> could in principle create an opportunity to learn lessons such as these. But there is a strong chance it will become as much of a political football as the Sue Gray report. That UK deaths were comparable to those of several other large European countries such as France, Spain and Italy does not make them a reasonably good outcome; public health experts have been dismayed at how poorly all these wealthy nations fared. (The per capita outcomes would look even worse if <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/076c3c8e-deb8-4fe7-897b-6eab47a01163\">high vaccine hesitancy</a> in eastern European countries had not created a late surge in deaths there.)<strong> </strong></p> <p>There are signs of worse to come. Liz Truss has indicated that she <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/08/09/abandon-kangaroo-court-whether-boris-johnson-lied-partygate/\">would vote to stop the Commons investigation</a> into whether Johnson misled parliament over the rule-breaking parties if she could; so much for accountability. And she has also declared that she would not authorise lockdowns for any future pandemic. This may be mere posturing, but such a position reveals a frightening ignorance about the future threats we face. Anyone fancy a lockdown-free pandemic of a virus like that which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), with a mortality rate of around 35%?</p> <p>There is another big question over who will replace Patrick Vallance as the government’s chief scientific adviser when he steps down next April. Johnson inherited Vallance; Truss will have the opportunity to find someone more compliant.</p> <p>The myopic conspiracy of silence over Covid bodes ill for our capacity to cope with future pandemics. It is also damaging our ability to process the tragedy of the current pandemic, which has claimed 200,000 lives in this country and will leave a legacy of disability as a result of long Covid. A marking of the trauma will surely be needed at some point. Unlike politicians, we can’t afford to let moving on mean refusing to look back.</p> <ul> <li><p>Philip Ball is a science writer</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/15/chelsea-close-to-winning-race-for-young-inter-midfielder-cesare-casadei","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T13:30:18Z","webTitle":"Chelsea close to winning race for young Inter midfielder Cesare Casadei ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/chelsea-close-to-winning-race-for-young-inter-midfielder-cesare-casadei","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/15/chelsea-close-to-winning-race-for-young-inter-midfielder-cesare-casadei","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea close to winning race for young Inter midfielder Cesare Casadei ","trailText":"Chelsea are close to winning the race to sign Internazionale’s highly rated midfielder Cesare Casadei","byline":"Jacob Steinberg","body":"<p>Chelsea are close to winning the race to sign Internazionale’s highly rated midfielder Cesare Casadei.

Lara Ricote, the winner of the Funny Women award 2021, is Mexican, grew up in Miami and now lives in the Netherlands. She mostly performs in English, but also runs her own Spanish-language comedy night in Amsterdam. Starting out, she found interesting material in comparisons between Mexican-Catholic culture “where the relationship with your body is: don’t touch it!” and Dutch culture, “where people are free and naked”. More recently, she’s written jokes about “how, when they’re correct, the Dutch are ruthless”, she says. “They’ll push you off the bike if you’re on the wrong side – with their hands, from a car, yelling at you!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c877b6d3cd502d1647c988ab5a26ee65c1842e12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c877b6d3cd502d1647c988ab5a26ee65c1842e12/0_29_2362_2953/800.jpg\" alt=\"‘I’m freer in Spanish – it feels more silly’ … Lara Ricote.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m freer in Spanish – it feels more silly’ … Lara Ricote.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Ullathorne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Argentinian Victoria Olsina, who is performing in a queer triple bill at the fringe, started standup in the UK partly because she “felt the need to be understood here. British culture is very different from Argentine culture – comedy is a device that you can use to bridge those differences.” She realised British people didn’t have much knowledge of Argentina. “I’m like a blank immigrant,” she says. Olsina used the Spice Girls as a segue into talking about her sexuality and Argentinian beauty standards. When she wanted to joke about the Falkland Islands, she wrote a love poem to Priti Patel: “I wish I was the Falkland Islands so you could occupy me indefinitely against international law.”</p> <p>But while there’s no shortage of material, what about the practicalities of switching languages? “You almost have to be 100 times funnier to be funny in Danish,” says Sofie Hagen, who started her comedy career in Denmark, but now lives in the UK and performs in English. “If I wanted to construct an English sentence that was funny, I have a lot more words to choose between. In Danish, there’s only one way of doing that sentence, so you have to be really creative.” While Danish material easily translated into English, when Hagen started writing new jokes in English, they required rewrites and testing at open mics to make them funny in Danish.</p> <p>Hagen noticed UK comedians’ funniest jokes often wouldn’t work written down, but “a Danish comedian’s joke will always work on paper”. This means a different vibe at comedy nights: in Denmark, there’s no audience interaction; comedians stick to a script. In the UK, shows are chattier and there are different forms of comedy. “In Denmark, we didn’t have alternative comedy. If anyone came on stage dressed up, we’d be like, ‘No, absolutely not. This is not comedy,’” Hagen says.</p> <p>While Ricote says much of her material is translatable between English and Spanish, there’s a joke about systemic racism that has proven tricky: “I have the language in English, but it felt Google-translated to say some of those phrases in Spanish.” Ricote’s onstage persona also differs depending on the country. “Spanish is my at-home language, so it’s the language I’m most childish in. I’m freer in Spanish, I do more accents, it feels more silly,” she says. “Whereas in English, I craft jokes more, I take comedy more seriously.”</p> <p>The question of persona can quickly become existential, says Hagen. “I often think: am I even the same person when I’m in Denmark speaking Danish? It’s so much about the cultural understanding that you have with the people you’re talking to.”</p> <p>Olsina only performs in English. If she did standup in Spanish, she says: “I would tell more stories. We don’t have one-liners, puns, dad jokes. Storytelling is the main genre of comedy in Spanish.” When Kotani came to the UK, sarcasm confused her, but now she delights in using it. In Japan, she says the most common style of comedy is the <em>manzai</em> double act, with the silly <em>boke</em> and straight <em>tsukkomi</em> who reacts to the other with the phrase <em>nandeyanen</em> (“I would translate that as something like ‘Why are you saying that?!’”).</p> <p>Ricote describes something similar in Mexican comedy – a tendency to emphasise punchlines with an exclamation, “like pointing at the joke in a slapstick-y way”, which becomes a joke in itself. The contrast was clear to Ricote after watching The Play That Goes Wrong in Mexico, then again in the UK. “In Spanish, there were many jokes about the fact that they did a joke.” This sort of approach doesn’t translate well to English, Ricote says, where it can feel “too old school”.</p> <p>While Das acts in Hindi, English is his first language. At comedy nights in Mumbai, the bill is often evenly split between English and Hindi sets. “If you look at Hindi or Punjabi, it’s drier and more poetic. There’s more space between punchlines, it’s more storytelling and it’s really quite profound,” he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49c30087ebfac029a4956cc66822795161f2a908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49c30087ebfac029a4956cc66822795161f2a908/0_189_4628_2777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘There is a lot more global common ground than there used to be’ … Vir Das.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘There is a lot more global common ground than there used to be’ … Vir Das.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indian standup in the English language is only recently coming into its own, Das says: “For a long time comedians were pandering to a palatable version of ‘the Indian’ for the west – because the west represented the mecca of standup. So we were doing surface-level material and not really telling our stories. It took us a while to say, ‘We can be from India and tell an authentically Indian story.’”</p> <p>Das incisively tackled his home country’s contradictions in his Two Indias monologue in 2021, receiving a standing ovation from a US crowd and much praise online, but also backlash, with the right-wing BJP party reporting Das to the police in India. Are stakes higher for comedians in certain countries? He doesn’t think so. “We’re rounding the corner on the fact that comedy is now a two-way conversation,” he says. “Now the audience’s voice is as loud as yours. As long as the reaction or feedback is within the limits of the law, I’ll always listen.”</p> <p>For some comics, certain styles work better in certain countries. “I don’t think we in Denmark are very good at making fun of ourselves,” Hagen says. “We’ve been fed that we’re the happiest, best country in the world. Whereas in the UK, there’s a lot of self-deprecating humour.” It wasn’t until doing comedy in the UK that Hagen noticed how “Danish comedy is very characterised by not having any limits. The way UK rightwing edgelords talk about comedy, like: ‘I’m allowed to say anything, it’s just satire’ – the majority of the Danish comedy scene is like that.” Feminism was the butt of jokes when Hagen was starting out and you had to be “one of the boys” to be accepted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/12/lara-ricote-review-edinbugh-2022\">Lara Ricote review – razor-sharp goofball is an original gagster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“So I came to the UK doing all my misogynistic material and had London audiences look at me like, ‘What on earth are you doing?’” Now, Hagen’s comedy is progressive and nuanced, but “I don’t know how long it would have taken me to change my mind if I hadn’t moved to London and been confronted.” Hagen is happy to report that queer and feminist comedy nights are now emerging back home.</p> <p>Das believes that, with the help of the internet, we’ve entered a new era of international comedy. “There is a lot more global common ground than there used to be,” he says, citing the pandemic and protests. “I want to create content out of India that is consumable by people anywhere in the world. It’s more important to tell an authentic story. When I would watch Dave Chappelle talk about Ohio or Richard Pryor talk about Illinois, I don’t know those neighbourhoods or those references, but it takes me on a journey.”</p> <p>“A lot of my material is personal, about family, body stuff, love, and that’s universal,” adds Hagen, who has performed in nearly 30 countries. “The essential language of humour is surprise, being able to relate to something, empathy and irony. Humour is not as local as we think it is.”</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sofie-hagen-fat-jokes\">Sofie Hagen</a> and <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/lara-ricote-grl-latnx-def\">Lara Ricote</a> are at Monkey Barrel Comedy Club; Victoria Olsina is in <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/clandestina-queer-comedy-triple-bill\">Clandestina Queer Comedy Triple Bill</a> at the Liquid Room Annexe; <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/vir-das-wanted\">Vir Das</a> is at the Pleasance Courtyard; and <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/yuriko-kotani-kaiju-about\">Yuriko Kotani</a> is at Pleasance Dome</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On the day of the tragedy they were skiing in warm and sunny conditions.</p> <p>“We decided to ski between a red and black run,” said Jones. “There were lots of previous ski tracks so we knew it had been traversed by others.</p> <p>“We were skiing along with only 10-20 metres between us. At about 10.50am we reached a point without any ski tracks.

There was no response so I phoned him but there was still no response. My initial thought was that he had skied down.”</p> <p>When Jones carefully walked back down the hill he could see a single ski sticking in the snow, the inquest heard. “I had to carefully dig in each foot to get down. I called out to him and phoned him again but there was no response.”</p> <p>Jones called mountain rescue at 11.05am and they sent a helicopter. A French mountain rescue team reached Rowell but he had suffered multiple fatal injuries.

The longtime stalwart of the National Trainers’ Federation has also found time to emerge as a key campaigner for a big reduction in British racing’s fixture list, in an attempt to address falling field sizes and improve competitiveness.</p> \n<p>A modest plan to cut 300 races from next year’s schedule fell through this year after opposition from Arena Racing Company (ARC), which operates 16 tracks and would have been expected to take most of the cut. In Haggas’s view, however, this would not have been nearly enough.</p> \n<p>“We as a body, the National Trainers’ Federation, were very much in favour of cancelling 300 races,” he told Sky Sports Racing last week, “and I would cancel 300 fixtures and make the pool of races smaller.</p> \n<p>“If the same amount of money is available, then [prize money] would go up. We have an issue at the moment with too much racing, there’s no doubt, and it’s only the trainers that are saying this and the trainers are the ones who benefit from too much racing.”</p> \n<p>The steady decline in field sizes is undoubtedly something that needs to be addressed. In the peak-season months from May to August, the average number of runners in turf handicaps on the Flat has dropped from 9.35 in 2019 – the last pre-pandemic season – to 8.37 in 2022. One horse per race, in other words, and the latest figure is disturbingly close to the eight runners required for three places each-way.</p> \n<p>But 300 fixtures is just over 20% of the 1,482 meetings on the 2022 schedule, which would be an immense and unprecedented cut to the calendar. It would almost certainly lead to the closure of several tracks and since the high-volume all-weather courses will not be among them the much-cherished spread and variety of British turf courses could be permanently diminished. When a track goes, it goes, and there will be no way to resurrect it 10 years down the line if everyone suddenly agrees it was all a terrible mistake.</p> \n<p>The “if” in Haggas’s interview also deserves close inspection, because as big ifs go, it’s a doozy. “If the same amount of money is available …” seems to assume that about 1,200 meetings with (slightly) more competitive field sizes will generate the same turnover and profit for the betting industry as approximately 1,500 at present. Since it would be an unprecedented move to cut 300 fixtures, there is no worthwhile evidence this would indeed be the case.</p> \n<p>And which 300 fixtures and – by extension – which courses should we cut? How can we be sure that we are axing the right ones?</p> \n<p>This question brings us back to a fundamental issue Haggas also highlighted in his interview: that much of the detail of the sport’s financing remains shrouded in secrecy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a9834989-9ab4-4adf-8633-f48fcbc4d94a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield Park&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>1.00 Pablo Prince</p>\n    <p>1.30 Lark Lane&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>2.00 Rainbow Sign&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>2.30 Jilly Cooper (nb)</p>\n    <p>3.00 Jade Country&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>3.30 Micks Spirit (nap)</p>\n    <p><b>Catterick Bridge</b></p>\n    <p>1.50 Irv</p>\n    <p>2.20 Kodade</p>\n    <p>2.50 Rain Cap&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>3.20 Magical Effect</p>\n    <p>3.55 Safran&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>4.25 Remembering</p>\n    <p>4.55 King Crimson&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Windsor&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>4.50 Tribal Wisdom</p>\n    <p>5.20 Foreseeable Future&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>5.50 Ancestral Land</p>\n    <p>6.20 Brazen Idol&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>6.50 La Roca del Fuego</p>\n    <p>7.20 Elena’s Gift</p>\n    <p>7.50 Pride Of Nepal</p>\n    <p><b>Bangor-On-Dee</b></p>\n    <p>5.10 Presentandcounting</p>\n    <p>5.40 Bempton Cliffs</p>\n    <p>6.10 Shareef Star</p>\n    <p>6.40 Francky Du Berlais</p>\n    <p>7.10 Aviewtosea</p>\n    <p>7.40 Elham Valley</p>\n    <p>8.15 Malina Ocarina</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“I feel very sorry for the BHA,” Haggas said. “They come under the cosh and get blamed for everything. The long and short of it is they don’t have the funding that the racecourses have. They get the media rights money direct to them, to do with it what they please. It’s up to the rest of the industry to put pressure on them as much as possible.”</p> \n<p>Racecourses sell their media rights directly to betting firms, in the retail and increasingly dominant online sectors. How much they get for those rights and, crucially, what proportion is diverted to prize money, is, from the tracks’ point of view, no one’s business but their own.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"932f42bd680c1191b98f02a76dd816c9f4c9a675\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/932f42bd680c1191b98f02a76dd816c9f4c9a675/128_283_3228_1938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baaeed, ridden by jockey Jim Crowley, wins the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baaeed, ridden by jockey Jim Crowley, wins the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This, inevitably, leads to suspicion and speculation among owners, trainers and other professionals they are not getting their fair share in prize money.

With Boris Johnson’s government in its death throes and the two candidates to succeed him at loggerheads over what to do, Sir Keir Starmer has come up with proposals that are big, costed and timely. They will put pressure on Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak to come up with something equally ambitious.</p> <p>The economics of the package are less clear cut, and have already been attacked by critics on the left and the right.</p> <p>Broadly, the plan involves freezing the energy price cap at its current level of just under £2,000 a year rather than allowing it to rise in line with global wholesale gas prices. Left unchecked, it is estimated the price cap will rise to more than £3,500 a year in October and to well over £4,000 a year in January.</p> <p>Labour says the plan would cost just shy of £30bn, although that’s on the assumption that it would apply only for the next six months. There is, however, no guarantee that the energy crisis will be over by next spring, and some analysts believe prices may stay high for years.</p> <p>Gas prices were already rising before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, but the war has pushed the cost of energy sharply higher, and there is no sign of the conflict ending soon. As with the furlough scheme introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic, £30bn may be simply a downpayment on a much bigger bill.</p> <p>Labour says part of the cost of its plan would be met from extending the windfall tax on energy companies and backdating its implementation to the start of 2022, something the party says would raise £8bn. There are two issues here: would an expanded windfall tax actually net £8bn, and if it did, would it only do so by disincentivising investment?</p> <p>Labour says one advantage of its plan is that it will reduce the annual inflation rate, now 9.4%, but projected by the Bank of England to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/inflation-rate-uk-poorest-households-forecast-energy-price-cap\">rise above 13%</a> when the new price cap is introduced in October. As Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, points out, inflation will come down in the short term but will rise again once the six-month scheme ends unless global gas prices fall.</p> <p>There’s also the question of whether support should be targeted rather than provided to all. Wealthy households who could afford to pay higher prices will be treated the same as poorer households who are facing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/30/food-food-fuel-tripled-citizens-advice-charity-eating-heating\">choice between eating and heating</a>.</p> <p>This has obvious political attractions, but an alternative to Labour’s universal plan would have been to use the benefits system to provide help for those who need it, perhaps by increasing the generosity of universal credit. Instead the scheme encourages better-off people to use more energy, which sits oddly with weaning the UK off fossil fuels and the drive to be a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050.</p> <p>Finally, the proposals are limited to consumers, despite the fact that businesses face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/13/uk-industrys-heavy-energy-users-fear-enforced-winter-shutdowns\">painful – and in some cases ruinous – increases in their energy bills from October</a>. Small businesses look especially vulnerable.</p> <p>Given that there is no immediate prospect of an election, Starmer will not have to implement his proposals and can say Labour’s plan is a short-term response to the cost of living crisis that is looming this winter. In that sense, politics matters more than economics. But it is conceivable that some of what the opposition is calling for will be picked up. Throughout this crisis, ministers have savaged Labour’s plans – over a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/26/sunak-announces-windfall-tax-energy-firms\">windfall tax</a>, for example – only to steal them later.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/15/how-to-achieve-an-equal-split-of-household-chores-kate-mangino","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T13:00:39Z","webTitle":"‘The woman’s to-do list is relentless’: how to achieve an equal split of household chores","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/15/how-to-achieve-an-equal-split-of-household-chores-kate-mangino","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/15/how-to-achieve-an-equal-split-of-household-chores-kate-mangino","fields":{"headline":"‘The woman’s to-do list is relentless’: how to achieve an equal split of household chores","trailText":"Gender expert Kate Mangino tracked down 40 men who did their fair share of work in the home to find out if they had anything in common – or whether there is a formula for getting the balance right","byline":"Emine Saner","body":"<p>When <a href=\"https://katemangino.com/\">Kate Mangino</a> started studying men whom she calls “equal partners” – those who do an equal share of domestic labour – she was hoping to unearth some kind of common truth. She was looking for something that would explain why they were relatively unusual, maybe even something to help a future partner spot one in the wild. “It was a disappointment, to be honest,” she says, with a laugh.</p> <p>Then she realised it was good news – these were men who hadn’t grown up with equal-partner fathers (only two of the 40 men she interviewed had). If they had willingly taken on half the domestic load, without seeing that as normal while growing up, then so could other men. “No matter where you came from, you can say: ‘I’d like to make this change,’” says Mangino, a gender expert who has written a book, Equal Partners: Improving Gender Equality at Home. “It might take some work and it might take some practice, but it’s not impossible.”</p> <p>In different-sex relationships, women do around 65% of the physical household work. Chores that are routine – cooking and cleaning, for instance – tend to fall to women, while intermittent chores, such as sorting out finances or mowing the lawn, are more likely to be done by men. “This means that the unpaid female role’s to-do list is relentless,” writes Mangino. After all, it doesn’t really matter if the lawn doesn’t get mowed, but try ignoring laundry for a month. Add the burden of cognitive labour – remembering birthdays, organising play dates – which disproportionately falls to women in heterosexual relationships, and it is exhausting.</p> <p>In same-sex relationships, domestic labour is more equal, “but can still fall back into those roles”, says Mangino (she talks about male and female roles, drawn from traditional gendered divides, rather than men and women).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEBUgQEpA2k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zEBUgQEpA2k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch Kate Mangino discuss her book with the Los Angeles Public Library and the University of Southern California’s Center for the Changing Family.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>For her book, Mangino interviewed 40 equal partners to find out what their domestic lives looked like and how they had been created. She says setting out expectations at the beginning of a relationship is “hugely important … it’s much easier to establish patterns from the beginning than to change a relationship 10 or 20 years into it. I think being really clear about expectations, and holding each other accountable from the start, is critical.”</p> <p>But if you didn’t have those conversations early on, your domestic load is unbalanced and you want to change it, what do you do? Mangino says change is possible, but “you need both partners to be interested. What’s difficult is when one partner wants change and the other is happy with the status quo – a lot of people in the female role are in that situation. It’s disheartening, and resentment builds up.”</p> <p>She suggests talking broadly about cultural norms and why you have fallen into gendered patterns, rather than criticising a partner, which could make them defensive. “Talk about: ‘We’ve both been raised in this gendered culture and if we’re going to make a change, we have to think about why we do things a certain way,’” she says. Another good trigger is to take advantage of a change – a new baby or pet, moving house, having to care for another family member – to rethink roles at home. It can help, says Mangino, to assign roles or domains based on personal preferences, but to question whether you are dividing them along traditionally gendered lines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When we see men wearing the baby carrier and going to the grocery store, it is tempting to assume we’ve achieved equality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It will probably involve realistic expectations and compromise, particularly if you have different standards. “One of my husband’s triggers is when the kitchen is a mess, [whereas] I’m quite happy to close the door and tackle it tomorrow,” says Mangino, who will make an effort to tidy the kitchen if she can. “It’s just those little thoughtful actions that say: ‘I know you well and I care enough about you to do this for you.’ I don’t mind the dirty kitchen, but I hate it when my bed is unmade. So we all have our own different standards, and it’s understanding and respecting your partner’s standards that I think is really important.”</p> <p>Naturally, communication is at the heart of this – and it is a continuing conversation, particularly as life changes. If a couple has children, that can entrench domestic labour for the person – usually the mother – on parental leave. “She gets used to doing everything in the home and everything child-related, then she goes back to work and adds the job.” An equal partnership, says Mangino, doesn’t mean “every day following each other around with a clipboard. You’re looking over the course of months or years. Does it average out to be 50/50? Because we all know that, on a daily and weekly basis, it’s going to ebb and flow.”</p> <p>Because men now do more at home than in previous generations – “We see men wearing the baby carrier and going to the grocery store,” says Mangino – it is tempting to “assume we’ve achieved equality, we’re all done. I think that those are fantastic changes, but we still haven’t really broken into the cognitive labour in the household. There’s a lot of invisible labour that the female role is doing that the rest of the household enjoys.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db103db6d44a7654fb3f1ed0a596e6f27018b718\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db103db6d44a7654fb3f1ed0a596e6f27018b718/0_189_5600_3359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man vacuuming while a woman reclines on the sofa using a laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The division of chores will ebb and flow on a daily basis – so take an audit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heather Binns/Getty Images/Image Source</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mangino recommends having an audit: “Just listing all of the things that you do or feel responsible for. Have your partner do the same. I also suggest people talk about time: do you both have enough time for your professional pursuits? If you have kids, enough nurturing time with them? Enough time for leisure? When you look at your invisible load, and you look at how much time you’re spending doing each thing, it can become more clear if you have equity, or if you need to reappropriate some tasks.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/feb/17/dirty-secret-why-housework-gender-gap\">Dirty secret: why is there still a housework gender gap?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are numerous benefits, she says, especially for the partner who will end up doing less boring housework. For this person, usually a woman, a lower domestic load can mean a boost in earning power, says Mangino, because of the “extra capacity, energy, interest to put your hat in the ring for the promotion, or to take on a management role. There are also emotional-health benefits.” Less resentment, for a start. For those stuck in the male role, not being encouraged to provide care for your spouse or children means “you don’t have opportunities for those nurturing moments that really build close bonds”.</p> <p>Mangino asked her 40 equal-partner men what they had gained from an equitable home life. “They would say: ‘I have a wonderful relationship with my spouse; we have a pretty decent sex life. I have a great relationship with my kids. I feel like I can be myself at home. I don’t have to perform masculinity – I don’t have to be the strong guy all the time.’”</p> <p>They are probably more tired, she says. “If both partners are truly doing half the work in the home, especially in homes with kids, you’re both going to fall into bed at night exhausted, you’re both going to feel like you’re doing 55% of the load. I think that’s normal. The benefit is that, yes, you’re still tired, and you’re still stressed, but you’re not bitter towards your partner. You’re a team and you’re doing it together.”</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://read.macmillan.com/lp/equal-partners/\">Equal Partners: Improving Gender Equality at Home</a> (</em><em>St Martin’s Press</em><em>) is out </em><em>now</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/15/in-brief-carrie-soto-is-back-taylor-jenkins-reid-high-a-journey-across-the-himalayas-erika-fatland-all-the-frequent-troubles-of-our-days-rebecca-donner-reviews","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T13:00:38Z","webTitle":"In brief: Carrie Soto Is Back; High; All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days – reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/15/in-brief-carrie-soto-is-back-taylor-jenkins-reid-high-a-journey-across-the-himalayas-erika-fatland-all-the-frequent-troubles-of-our-days-rebecca-donner-reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/15/in-brief-carrie-soto-is-back-taylor-jenkins-reid-high-a-journey-across-the-himalayas-erika-fatland-all-the-frequent-troubles-of-our-days-rebecca-donner-reviews","fields":{"headline":"In brief: Carrie Soto Is Back; High; All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days – reviews","trailText":"A retired tennis champion defends her title and finds herself; Erika Fatland has an insightful Himalayan adventure; and a gripping true story of a woman in the anti-Nazi resistance","byline":"Hannah Beckerman","body":"<h2><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/carrie-soto-is-back-9781529152128\">Carrie Soto </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/carrie-soto-is-back-9781529152128\">Is Back</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Taylor Jenkins Reid</strong><strong><br></strong><em>Hutchinson Heinemann, £16.99, pp368</em></p> <p>Carrie Soto is a retired tennis champion whose grand slam record is about to be broken.

Despite numerous government initiatives over the past two decades, the Pacific coast region lacks basic public services from education to health. A 2018 study showed that less than half of the population had access to clean water and sewerage and barely a quarter to electricity. The region was hit particularly hard during the pandemic, with over 30% of the population experiencing multidimensional poverty.</p> <p>“It’s state neglect,” said father Ilario Cuero Montaño, Guapi’s Roman Catholic priest. “The institutions are here, but there is a lack of opportunities to stop young people following the wrong path.”</p> <p>The town has become the focus of a turf war between the guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident fighters from the now-demobilised Farc rebels, seeking to control drug routes and mechanized gold mining that pollutes local rivers.</p> <p>“We used to live in total harmony,” said Cuero. “There was trust and respect and, until recently, there were no murders. The arrival of cocaine and illegal mining has led to a decline in public order.” On Friday, negotiators from Petro’s government and the ELN met in Havana to restart peace talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0c5f0aa99f78b7ebe65e587e6e8a5760541c19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0c5f0aa99f78b7ebe65e587e6e8a5760541c19d/0_0_3519_2111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman wearing a white and blue ruffled dress and straw hat sings into a mike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Otoniel Orobio performing with a guasás.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Camilo Rodriguez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the 24 hours surrounding Petro’s election on 19 June, six people were murdered in the region around Guapi. The wooden walls of the stilted houses are daubed with Farc graffiti. Colombia leads the world in murders of social leaders and the Pacific is its most deadly region. Of the 104 leaders killed so far in 2022, 42 were in the Pacific, according to Indepaz, a local NGO.</p> <p>Alongside the church hall is a home for 36 young people, many of whom are orphans or the children of members of armed groups. Several musicians were unable to visit Guapi for fears of their safety, and one group has to depart early to ensure they complete the long return trip in motorized canoe before nightfall. Making Guapi safe again is a prerequisite for any development plan, in Cuero’s view.</p> <p>“Security is the main thing,” he said, “Francia and Petro have lit a light of hope. Things can change.”</p> <p>Petro won the presidency with an ambitious platform that promised jobs, land reform and environmental protection. He also proposes a bilateral ceasefire with the ELN. Nowhere in Colombia’s vast territory are these four elements intertwined to the same extent as in the Colombian Pacific. </p> <p>“The Pacific has enormous potential in areas such as cultural tourism and green business, but the state needs to provide consistent public services and a greater presence of security forces in order to develop this potential,” said Mayol. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3772641934363a912dd53a116bd43e64222d68a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3772641934363a912dd53a116bd43e64222d68a/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gathered in the streets, cheering and celebrating.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petronio Álvarez has positioned itself as a meeting space for Afro Colombians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in Guapi, such considerations have taken a backseat for the time being. When the final group leaves the stage, all the participating bands join together to sing an improvised call and response song. The response? “Queremos Paz!” – We want peace.</p> <p>The party lasts long into the rainswept night, the drumbeats rattling the corrugated iron roof of a local bar, plastic cups of viche, the local sugar cane brew, passed generously to friends and strangers alike.</p> <p>“Without Petronio Álvarez there’s no joy” says Orobio, “we’ve been rehearsing for this since January. If we can win Petronio, I can say to God that I achieved my goal.”</p> <p>But the next day, her voice cracking slightly from the previous day’s exertions, she is in a more reflective mood. She says she hopes that the new government will build a hospital in Guapi and provide greater funds for cultural activities so she can continue to teach traditional Afro-Colombian music to young people falling ever under the spell of reggaeton.</p> <p>“The new government is bound up with the Pacific now,” she says. “If they can’t bring change in the next four years, there’s no more route for us to follow. In the next elections we won’t vote for anyone, what would be the point?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/15/uk-workers-office-home","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T12:54:29Z","webTitle":"UK workers going into office less than 1.5 days a week, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/uk-workers-office-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/15/uk-workers-office-home","fields":{"headline":"UK workers going into office less than 1.5 days a week, data shows","trailText":"Firms need to find smarter ways of working that will fit in with how people want to live, says consultancy","byline":"Mark Sweney","body":"<p>The typical UK worker is going into the office less than 1.5 days a week – with Friday the most popular day to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/02/how-working-from-home-has-divided-britain\">work from home</a>, according to a global survey.</p> <p>The consultancy Advanced Workplace Associates (AWA) surveyed 43 offices in the UK, covering nearly 50,000 workers, in June and July.</p> <p>The report found that the average attendance was 29% – just 1.45 days of a standard five-day working week – peaking at 39% mid-week.

With sketch troupes: not so much. It feels like a long time since the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/26/the-league-of-gentlemen-review-stage-tour\">The League of Gentlemen</a> springboarded from Edinburgh glory to TV fame. TV sketch shows are now skeletally thin on the ground.

Over and above the ironic apologia for sketch that frames the show, they’ve a terrific device at play this year, which is to ask an audience member to tally every single laugh they receive. As if first-performer-among-equals Ed Easton needed anything else to be highly strung about: he monitors the monitor skittishly for the rest of the show. It can’t be an easy job: by the time Easton appears on stage as the Creature from the Black Lagoon halfway through a preposterous sketch about a Dracula-themed tourist attraction (no spoilers, but his entrance ups the comic ante by some margin), the room is in hysterics.

Their new suite of sketches and chat, Friends and Nothing More, passes a thoroughly enjoyable hour while we wait, possibly in vain, for a full series. The conceit here, tenuously enough, is that they want us to fall in love with them. Marry them, even: isn’t that what women of their age are supposed to be looking for?

She said the former footballer became angry as he tried to retrieve a mobile phone from her sister’s hand, leading to a “scuffle” on the floor.</p> <p>She described how she tried to pull Giggs away from her sister when he stood up and his elbow struck her in the face in “a ‘get off me’ manner”. The court heard Giggs then went “from annoyed to extremely angry” and head-butted Kate Greville in the face.</p> <p>The witness said: “He put both hands on Kate’s shoulders and with lots of force used his head to head-butt her in her lip. Afterwards he told me it was my fault he had head-butt Kate and turned to me and said: ‘I’ll head-butt you next.’”</p> <p>Emma Greville said her sister “fell to the ground screaming, covering her face” while Giggs walked away towards the kitchen.</p> <p>Asked by the prosecutor, Peter Wright QC, how she felt when the former Manchester United player threatened to head-butt her, she said: “I felt fear as he had just head-butt Kate so why would he not do the same to me?”</p> <p>Kate Greville, who had been in an on-off relationship with Giggs for about six years at this point, told her sister to call the police, the court heard. Jurors were told Giggs pleaded with the witness not to call the police and was saying: “Think about my daughter, think about my career.”</p> <p>“He was still trying to talk to me while I was on the phone to police – to think about him and also think about Kate and her career … to persuade us not to call the police because he said it would be in all the newspapers,” she said.</p> <p>The trial at Manchester crown court also heard from Kate Greville’s employer, Elsa Roodt, who said her company had to block Giggs’s emails because his then partner “couldn’t do her work”. </p> <p>Appearing via videolink from Dubai, Roodt said: “At one stage, early on in her employment, we had to call our internet provider to block Ryan Giggs’ email. It was intense and Kate couldn’t do her work.

Earlier this week, shortly after making his Bundesliga debut for Borussia Dortmund, the young Germany centre-back was a guest on a chat show on the club’s in-house television channel in front of a live audience.</p> \n<p>The Sky presenter Sebastian Hellmann, Schlotterbeck’s fellow panellist, mentioned an upcoming assignment at Schalke’s game with Borussia Mönchengladbach, the Top-Spiel (top game) of the second weekend of the league season, in the prime Saturday early evening, 6.30pm kick-off slot. “They have Top-Spiel in Schalke?” Schlotterbeck wryly chipped in, naturally bringing the house down with a ribbing of BVB’s local rivals.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/15/milan-begin-title-defence-in-style-as-inter-leave-it-late-in-serie-a\">Milan begin title defence in style as Inter leave it late in Serie A | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Schalke have received more than their share of digs in the last few years. It has been a steady slide downhill since Domenico Tedesco was fired after March 2019’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/12/manchester-city-schalke-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\">7-0 Champions League (that’s right) defeat</a> at Manchester City. Leroy Sané, a star pupil of the club’s vaunted academy, scored in that one, almost four years to the day after he’d scored for <em>Die Königsblauen</em> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/mar/10/real-madrid-v-schalke-champions-league-live\">a thrilling win at Real Madrid</a>. The rest is the stuff of infamy – the inglorious David Wagner reign, the four-coach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/apr/22/tears-flow-and-tempers-boil-over-as-sorry-schalke-bow-out-of-bundesliga\">relegation season</a>, even flirting with Tasmania Berlin’s 31-match record of Bundesliga games without a win (when Schalke beat Hoffenheim in January 2021 to avoid that, Tasmania were as relieved as they were).</p> \n<p>Coming back was not easy. Even amid the joy and relief of promotion back to the Bundesliga at the first attempt, there was the prospect of more bills to pay. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Schalke felt compelled to cut ties with long-term sponsor Gazprom (Dortmund offered to donate and fill the financial gap). Meanwhile Dimitrios Grammozis, fired as coach in March with Schalke languishing in sixth, is still receiving his €1.2m salary, with the promotion secured by his immediate successor Mike Büskens triggering a year’s extension.</p> \n<p>So they have an ex-coach they are paying more than their current coach, Frank Kramer (he earns €1m per season). They even pay Grammozis a bonus for every top-flight point they earn this term.</p> \n<p>Saturday’s visit of Gladbach made it all worth it. Some 62,271 fans packed out Veltins-Arena, its first sellout in two-and-a-half years. Those supporters greeted their side with a teeming blue and white choreo and a banner reading “Hundertmal schon totgesagt und dann stehst du wieder auf” (“You’ve been declared dead a hundred times and then you get up again”). And how their team played out those words.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6dbf4ff24b09d9c539f8237c20f1d27a2a66d026\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dbf4ff24b09d9c539f8237c20f1d27a2a66d026/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marius Bülter celebrates after equalising for Schalke against Gladbach in injury time\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marius Bülter celebrates after equalising for Schalke against Gladbach in injury time.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thilo Schmülgen/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Crowd favourite Rodrigo Zalazar, scorer of the goal that won promotion, got a first-half opener from range, but Schalke’s all-action tempo wore them out. Gladbach’s patient possession game won control, and goals from Jonas Hofmann and Marcus Thuram looked like spoiling the party. Enter Marius Bülter. When VAR confirmed Patrick Herrmann had handled in attempting to nod a cross clear in stoppage time, Bülter stepped up. He converted nervelessly, the supporters erupted and Schalke had a precious point.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/15/for-almeria-even-the-almighty-cannot-hold-real-madrid-off-forever-la-liga\">For Almería, even the almighty cannot hold Real Madrid off forever | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“We will always have setbacks in the Bundesliga,” Kramer told Sky. “You have to get back up, and that’s what the team did today. That’s what fits the culture here and that’s what people want to see.” The new season has already given strong hints of a (necessary) siege mentality. A spirited performance in the opening-day defeat at Köln was undercut with a sense of injustice after a potential opening goal for Zalazar was ruled out, followed by Dominick Drexler’s red card. Both were probably correct, but borderline enough to create a grievance.</p> \n<p>Here, goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow, felt to be a fairly good get on loan from Hertha, dropped a second ricket in as many weeks. Having presented Florian Kainz with the crucial second in last week’s loss, another handling error here allowed the revitalised Thuram to give Gladbach a lead that looked like being decisive. Yet Peter Knäbel, Schalke’s sporting director, moved quickly to shut down any speculation over Schwolow’s status when interviewed. “We’re not having a discussion about goalkeepers at all,” he emphasised.</p> \n<p>Knäbel also acknowledged the gap between the first and second tier, not least athletically. Zalazar can’t yet last 90 minutes and Jordan Larsson, a bargain signing after his release from Spartak Moscow, will also need time to get match fit. In the meantime, those fans will carry them. “They sent out an acoustic force that could be understood as a signal: Schalke are back,” wrote Nils Balke-Barton in WAZ. They are aiming for survival this year, but Schalke’s presence is something the Bundesliga has missed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2cc1f6db-73c5-46c2-9953-82bc63b0b2dd\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Bayern 2-0 Wolfsburg, Mainz 0-0 Union Berlin, Schalke 2-2 Borussia Mönchengladbach, Hertha Berlin 1-1 Eintracht Frankfurt, Hoffenheim 3-2 VfL Bochum, Leverkusen 1-2 Augsburg, Leipzig 2-2 Cologne, Werder Bremen 2-2 Stuttgart, Freiburg 1-3 Dortmund.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>• Bayern Munich and Dortmund both maintained their 100% records (they are the only two to have managed it), which they’ve arrived at in sharply contrasting ways. Bayern were once again imperious against one of their favourite opponents, Wolfsburg, who’ve had far worse visits to Allianz Arena than the 2-0 defeat on Sunday. “It was about administration,” said Julian Nagelsmann, who enjoyed the control of his side’s performance after the previous week’s explosiveness, “which we didn’t always do well last year.” It was a good afternoon for Thomas Müller in particular, who scored the second and got one over on Niko Kovac, the coach who almost pushed him to the Bayern exit door.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61cabc4ee7d696fadb0e63ff1e44548182cfa825\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61cabc4ee7d696fadb0e63ff1e44548182cfa825/0_0_3295_2182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Müller acknowledges fans after the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Müller acknowledges fans after the match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Gebert/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>• Having clung on grimly against Leverkusen last week, BVB came back late at Freiburg after taking an early pounding from the excellent hosts, who led through Michael Gregoritsch. Edin Terzic’s substitutes turned it around in the final quarter-hour – the 18-year-old Englishman Jamie Bynoe-Gittens got his debut senior goal with a well-hit long-ranger that Mark Flekken really should have saved, before fellow teenager Youssoufa Moukoko and Marius Wolf struck to win the match. Jude Bellingham, a comparative veteran at 19, hailed the impact of “my sons” on social media.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"180fc6b6a2b8631831d700f2bdf022e16c547975\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/180fc6b6a2b8631831d700f2bdf022e16c547975/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youssoufa Moukoko celebrates scoring Dortmund’s second goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youssoufa Moukoko celebrates scoring Dortmund’s second goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>• Leipzig hailed the return of Timo Werner, who looked a bit rusty but marked his comeback with the opener against Köln thanks to another generous bit of goalkeeping, with Marvin Schwäbe diving over his shot. Yet the hosts twice frittered away the lead, with Josko Gvardiol’s unfortunate own goal giving Steffen Baumgart’s team a point. Domenico Tedesco was pleased with his side’s grit despite still waiting for a first win. “A lot of teams that had to deal with what we did today would have lost,” argued the coach.</p> \n<p>• Leverkusen’s start has been worrying, with one of the favourites to grip Bayern’s coattails sitting bottom of the table having lost three competitive games out of three (when including the Pokal embarrassment at third-tier Elversberg). This weekend’s home loss to Augsburg was one of those afternoons in what’s been one of those seasons so far – <em>Die Werkself</em> have had their moments in all three matches – with Rafal Gikiewicz making a string of saves and Amine Adli fracturing his collarbone in his first game back after four months out for Gerardo Seoane’s side. André Hahn’s firmly finished winner provided a first win for the visitors’ rookie coach Enrico Maaßen – freshly arrived from Dortmund’s second team – after last week’s chastening Bundesliga debut defeat at home to Freiburg.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/625\"> \n <table data-embed-type=\"table\"

Here we look at how they differ on key areas of policy.</p> \n<h2>Economy and cost of living</h2> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>has said her “first port of call” – for the economy and help with energy bills – will be tax cuts. She has pledged to reverse the recent national insurance rate rise, which was designed to fund health and social care, to be paid for by fiscal headroom and a delay to paying off debt accrued during the Covid pandemic.</p> \n<p>Truss has not ruled out specific help for energy bills, while refusing to set out what this may involve, beyond a suspension of green levies, costing about £150 a year on the average bill. She has more generally said she dislikes “handouts” and prefers people to keep more of their own money.</p> \n<p>A tax cuts-based economic policy would disproportionately help those who are better off and do nothing for pensioners or those out of work. But Truss has insisted her plan for a low tax, low regulation approach would boost economic growth and help everyone in the longer term.</p> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>has promised “a return to traditional Conservative economic values”, a position seen variously as an appeal to instinctive Tory fiscal prudence, or a desire to return to “austerity economics”. When challenged with claims he was a “high-tax chancellor”, he took aim at other candidates offering “comforting fairytales” rather than face the hard economic reality. He has said he aims to cut taxes but wants to tackle inflation first.</p> \n<p>However, later in the race to No 10, he promised to scrap VAT on household fuel bills for a year. The handout would be worth £160 for every household.</p> \n<p>Sunak has also promised to lower taxes by 20% by the end of the decade, more specifically that he would cut the basic rate of income tax to 16p if the Conservatives are re-elected in 2024.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc4c13b8-59b1-493c-a396-1be1b87886a1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9XQEGBqbxa0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Climate</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss </strong>has committed to maintaining the government’s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, but has said she would suspend green energy levies.</p> \n<p>She is backed by the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who is relatively strong on renewable energy, and another backer, Vicky Ford, says she was very supportive of Cop26.</p> \n<p><strong>Sunak </strong>would set a new legal target for the UK to be energy independent by 2045 at the latest and has committed to maintaining the government’s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and has assured the Tories’ green wing he would protect the environment.</p> \n<p>Insiders say Sunak was resistant to spending money on climate measures when he ran the Treasury. He has, however, previously spoken out in support of net zero and made the case for a greener economy.</p> \n<h2>Education</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss </strong>has bemoaned the quality of the state school she attended, which critics swiftly pointed out occurred under Conservative governments, and has promised to give everyone “the same opportunities” so they are “able to know that the town they are born in has opportunity”.</p> \n<p>Truss has also said that every student who achieves three A* grades at A-level should be offered an admissions interview at either Oxford or Cambridge.</p> \n<p><strong>Sunak</strong> supporters Nick Gibb and Damian Hinds, both of whom have served as ministers in the Department for Education, laid out Sunak’s approach to schooling in a column in the Times. The education system will be “focused on excellence and delivering the skills and knowledge needed for the world of tomorrow”, they wrote. He plans to help the best multi-academy trusts to expand, and fulfil a commitment to establish high-quality post-16 specialist free schools outside London and the south-east.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/21/rishi-sunak-would-not-cut-taxes-before-autumn-2023-in-clear-divide-with-liz-truss\">Sunak would not cut taxes before autumn 2023, in clear divide with Truss</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Home affairs</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss </strong>has reportedly said she would attempt to expand the Rwanda removal scheme to countries such as Turkey, and has called it “completely moral”.</p> \n<p>She has pledged to bring back national crime targets – committing to a 20% reduction in murders, other violence and burglaries within two years if she became prime minister.</p> \n<p>Truss has also promised to crack down on violence against women and girls. Under her plans, a standalone offence to criminalise street harassment would be introduced alongside a national domestic abuse register, which would include coercive and controlling behaviour and financial abuse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"167f5d8c-870d-4c38-a28e-d1653dee7f7c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XZorayXZ4NQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Sunak </strong>supports the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/17/home-office-in-fresh-row-with-unhcr-over-rwanda-asylum-policy\">Rwanda removal scheme</a>, though sources have briefed that he opposed it as chancellor over the £120m cost. He has promised a “crackdown on grooming gangs” and has pledged to create a requirement for all police forces to have a ringfenced child sexual exploitation team.</p> \n<h2>Levelling up</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss </strong>has also committed to continuing the levelling up agenda but added she would do this in a “Conservative way”. Commentators have suggested this means a focus on tax cuts and deregulation, rather than high spending and investment.</p> \n<p><strong>Sunak </strong>picked up the endorsement of the Tory Tees valley mayor, Ben Houchen, as well as a host of “red wall” MPs over his levelling up pledges. He has committed to maintaining a cabinet-level secretary of state for levelling up. Houchen said he was encouraged by Sunak’s interest in the levelling up agenda.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to&nbsp;First&nbsp;Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The NHS</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss </strong>is expected to give more detailed policy announcements on the NHS, but she has said she is “completely committed” to government promises for NHS spending.</p> \n<p>One particular area where she faces questions is how she will find money to pay for and tackle the Covid-related NHS backlog given that she has pledged to reverse the national insurance rise introduced to fund this and other costs.</p> \n<p><strong>Sunak </strong>is pledging to create a “vaccines style” taskforce dedicated to tackling NHS backlogs. He plans to eliminate one-year waiting times six months earlier than planned by September 2024, and to get overall numbers falling by next year.</p> \n<p>He is warning of “privatisation by the back door” as a result of people who are spending money they can’t afford to go private due to the size of waiting lists.</p> \n<h2>Brexit</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss </strong>has vowed to review all EU laws retained after Brexit by the end of next year, and to scrap or replace those that are deemed to hinder UK growth.</p> \n<p>Truss was a remainer in the referendum campaign but has since become a keen convert to Brexit. She has led negotiations with Brussels over subsequent disagreements and is pushing new legislation that would unilaterally rewrite Britain’s post-Brexit commitments to the EU over Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p><strong>Sunak </strong>came out early for Brexit in the run-up to the referendum. He has reportedly backed proposals on the “Northern Ireland protocol” and, as chancellor, promoted “freeports” around Britain as one way of benefiting from Brexit. He has committed to a bonfire of EU laws that are “getting in the way” of British businesses.</p> \n<h2>Immigration</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss</strong>’s main pitch is ensuring the removal of some asylum seekers to Rwanda goes ahead, and she has pledged to deliver it by reforming the UK’s relationship with the European convention on human rights. The foreign secretary also wants to increase Border Force capacity by 20%, to increase patrols in the Channel and explore “all possible turnaround tactics”. An overhauled bill of rights would be used to enshrine these in law.</p> \n<p><strong>Sunak</strong>, despite having served as chancellor for more than two years, has been scathing of the immigration system – calling it broken and chaotic.</p> \n<p>He has said the UK does not have control over its borders and so pledged to reduce the number of people granted asylum in the UK by changing the definition of who qualifies for it, allow MPs to set an annual cap on the number of refugees accepted each year and pursue further Rwanda-style removal plans with other countries.</p> \n<p>He would also withhold aid from countries that do not receive refused asylum seekers and criminals.</p> \n<h2>Media</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss </strong>is also believed to support privatisation of Channel 4, although she has yet to publicly make her position clear. The sale of Channel 4 is strongly supported by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who is a vocal Truss supporter.</p> \n<p><strong>Sunak </strong>will proceed with the sale of Channel 4, saying privatisation would help the broadcaster compete with big streaming firms. Plans for privatisation are expected to be ready when parliament returns – under a new prime minister – in the autumn.</p> \n<h2>Foreign policy and defence</h2> \n<p>Before the leadership race, <strong>Truss</strong> set out her vision in May of a more assertive G7, which she wanted to be “more institutionalised” and turned into an “economic Nato” that can defend its members from Chinese economic coercion.</p> \n<p>As foreign secretary, she has been at the forefront of Britain’s more hawkish position on Russia, in comparison with Ukraine’s other western allies. She is promising to spend 3% of GDP on defence.</p> \n<p>Both candidates have yet to set out any big new foreign policy positions during the campaign, although <strong>Sunak</strong> will be eager to shore up his credentials in this area and emphasise his G7 role brokering a minimum global corporation tax rate.</p> \n<p>Having lived and worked in the US, Sunak is regarded as a committed Atlanticist and Eurosceptic. In terms of defence spending, Sunak has expressed opposition to “arbitrary targets”.</p> \n<h2>Scotland</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss</strong>, when asked if she would agree to a request for a second Scottish independence referendum under any circumstances, said this week: “No.”</p> \n<p>She added: “The last referendum in 2014 was described as a once-in-a-generation referendum. We’re now in 2022 – that is not a generation ago.” </p> \n<p><strong>Sunak </strong>has said he would try to make an “emotional argument for the United Kingdom from the heart, as well as the practical argument for it and demonstrating it”.</p> \n<p>He has promised to rule out a second referendum on Scottish independence. However, in 2017 he said it would be “hard” to block a second vote on Scottish independence, and that it should be pushed back until after Brexit.</p> \n<h2>Strikes</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss</strong> has promised a further crackdown on trade unions, widening restrictions to a significant new number of industries.</p> \n<p>Truss said she would legislate for minimum service levels on critical national infrastructure in the first 30 days of government under her leadership. The pledge would go further than the Tories’ 2019 policy, which promised a minimum service should operate during transport strikes.</p> \n<p>The new law proposed by Truss would restrict teachers, postal workers and the energy sector. Tailored minimum thresholds, including staffing levels, would be determined with each industry.</p> \n<h2>Whitehall</h2> \n<p><strong>Truss</strong> has announced a string of reforms of the civil service, which she claims will cut the “bureaucracy and inefficiency” of Whitehall.</p> \n<p>These reforms include the scrapping of civil service roles that focus on diversity and inclusion, and she will cap the median amount of annual leave public sector workers are entitled to, to 25 days. She also says she will defund the paid time off that public sector trade union officials can take to carry out union duties.</p> \n<p><strong>Sunak</strong> has not officially announced any policies regarding Whitehall yet, but in December it was reported that as chancellor, he was drawing up plans to cut tens of thousands of Whitehall jobs.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/philip-purser-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T12:09:05Z","webTitle":"Philip Purser obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/philip-purser-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/philip-purser-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Philip Purser obituary","trailText":"Novelist and dramatist who went on to become one of the most respected television critics of his generation","byline":"Mike Ripley","body":"<p>The television critic Philip Purser, who has died aged 96 after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, was one of the longest-serving and most respected pundits in the TV industry, in which he was also involved as a writer.</p> <p>His detailed knowledge led to him contributing to numerous documentaries about British television and his appointment as co-editor of the 1982 and 1986 editions of Halliwell’s Television Companion. In the 1960s and 70s he was active in discussions on and off screen about censorship and the future of broadcasting, and was one of the chief adversaries of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/23/broadcasting5\" title=\"\">Mary Whitehouse</a> of the National Viewers’ and Listeners’ Association.</p> <p>A journalist on the News Chronicle until its demise in 1960, Philip vowed never to be “on anyone’s staff” again and became a dedicated freelance. Having reviewed television for the Chronicle and the Daily Mail, he decided to specialise and became the television critic for the Sunday Telegraph from its birth in 1961. He was to hold the post for 26 years, combining his critical viewing with careers as a novelist and dramatist.</p> <p>For his debut thriller, he chose a down-at-heel, out-of-work screenwriter, Colin Panton, as the hero of Peregrination 22 (1962), who, working reluctantly for a travel agency, accompanies a tour party to Spitsbergen and discovers a Nazi-revivalist conspiracy.</p> <p>Although Philip’s preference for unheroic heroes – more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1991/apr/04/fiction\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a> than John Buchan, as one critic wrote – brought his early thrillers complimentary reviews, they were overshadowed by being published at the same time as The Ipcress File and The Spy Who Came in from the Cold dominated the bestseller lists, and cinemagoers were queueing to see Dr No and From Russia With Love.</p> <p>In 1968 he produced what many consider his best thriller, Night of Glass, about four Cambridge undergraduates, one of them, like him, a provincial grammar school boy, who turn a rag-week dare into a genuine attempt to break a prisoner out of Dachau concentration camp in 1938.</p> <p>His first experience of television drama came when his second novel, a downbeat story of espionage and defectors, Four Days to the Fireworks, published in 1964, was adapted the following year in ITV’s Play of the Week series, with <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-denholm-elliott-1555931.html\" title=\"\">Denholm Elliott</a> starring. Philip then adapted the story Calf Love for the BBC’s Wednesday Play slot (1966), and contributed an episode to ITV’s successful drama series A Family at War (1971).</p> <p>Heydays Hotel (1976) for Granada, starring a young Nigel Havers, was, he maintained, an experiment in <em>trompe l’oeil</em> television; a conventional period drama turning unexpectedly into something quite different.</p> <p> His Bafta-nominated drama documentary <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078033/\" title=\"\">The One and Only Phyllis Dixey</a> (1978) for Thames TV celebrated the life of the woman once labelled “Britain’s queen of striptease”.</p> <p>Born in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, Philip was the son of Phyllis (nee Palmer) and Jack Purser. His mother, a talented artist and illustrator who became a noted designer of illustrated postcards, and father, taking a job with Tarmac in Liverpool in 1934, moved to live in Wirral. Philip was educated at Birkenhead school and, after a wartime short course studying engineering at Cambridge, served in the Royal Engineers in the Middle East and Europe in the last days of the second world warwar. He was to tell a fellow writer that the best thing he got from his military service was to be allocated a pair of Afrika Korps-issue pyjamas, captured pristine, which lasted him “for the next decade”.</p> <p>With peacetime and demobilisation, he enrolled at St Andrews University with the intention of becoming an engineer. But after two years he left to pursue a career in journalism, moving to London to join the News Chronicle, and so began his exploration of all manner of storytelling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bf840d4d9d97b8d5460186affdf6da0fc0c24cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bf840d4d9d97b8d5460186affdf6da0fc0c24cf/0_40_707_424/500.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Purser worked as a freelance journalist, contributing columns to the Oldie and writing obituaries for the Guardian.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Purser worked as a freelance journalist, contributing columns to the Oldie and writing obituaries for the Guardian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martyn Goddard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1990, Philip combined his love of British film with his interest in wartime thrillers in the novel Friedrich Harris: Shooting the Hero, a tongue-in-cheek fantasy to plant an Irish-German Nazi agent among the crew filming the battle of Agincourt (in Ireland) for Laurence Olivier’s film of Henry V in 1944. The agent, Harris, working for Joseph Goebbels, is tasked with either persuading Olivier to come over to the Germans to help fight Bolshevism, or, failing that, assassinating him. Needless to say, an ample supply of Guinness and the course of the war thwarted the plan.</p> <p>Shooting the Hero was an extended version of one of his favourite journalistic devices: the spoof. Notable April Fools’ Day articles included the Last Great Tram Race, inspired by his “childhood memories” of Liverpool, which prompted a huge number of fond recollections from readers but was completely untrue. It went on to provide the title of his memoir (1974).</p> <p>In 2005 Philip produced a “rather belated” follow-up to Night of Glass in Lights in the Sky, about an attempt to smuggle evidence of the Holocaust out of Europe. He continued to work as a freelance journalist, contributing alternative biographies and book reviews to the Oldie and obituaries to the Guardian.</p> <p>In 1957 he married the crime writer Ann Goodman, and the couple lived for many years in the Northamptonshire village of Blakesley.

Characterisation is puddle-deep, with Ace’s serial dick-flashing predominating. It’s not every day you see protagonists having a bisexual foursome, something that goes weirdly unexplored in the later tensions. Everyone behaves idiotically, prompted by story needs: the first squabble over the loot is quickly forgotten, so they can have an impromptu dance party to draw in the criminals. The actors overcompensate for the weak script with postural, shrill performances. The directors overcompensate, never throwing in one drone shot when three or four will do.</p> <p>Which makes the sudden lurch into an operatic bloodbath, shot with considerable psychological acuity, all the more impressive. Shortly afterwards, there is a second confrontation that’s almost as eye-catchingly lensed, the camera swivelling ceaselessly to reveal and then hide the carnage, a bit like Jack Nicholson’s death scene in The Passenger. The Fuicas don’t hone the choreography as finely this time, but clearly there is some visual talent there. So it’s a shame they bandy it around indiscriminately, like noisy city folk in the sticks.</p> <p>• Camping Trip is available on digital platforms on 16 August.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/15/spiced-lamb-recipe-cucumber-yoghurt-nigella-seed-flatbreads-thomasina-miers","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T12:00:37Z","webTitle":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for spiced lamb with flatbreads and cucumber yoghurt | The new flexitarian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/15/spiced-lamb-recipe-cucumber-yoghurt-nigella-seed-flatbreads-thomasina-miers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/15/spiced-lamb-recipe-cucumber-yoghurt-nigella-seed-flatbreads-thomasina-miers","fields":{"headline":"Thomasina Miers’ recipe for spiced lamb with flatbreads and cucumber yoghurt","trailText":"Spiced lamb mince with homemade flatbreads for scooping and a cucumber yoghurt for dipping","byline":"Thomasina Miers","body":"<p>I recently went to Groundswell festival, an inspiring regenerative farming conference where I met a host of farmers and bakers who are experimenting with different varieties of wheat. I am increasingly fascinated by different wheats and have been researching this fibre’s pivotal role in improving gut health. You could, too! Try wholemeal and ancient grains in these easy flatbreads and use them to scoop up the deliciously fatty, spiced lamb.</p> <h2>Spiced lamb with cucumber yoghurt and nigella seed flatbreads</h2> <p>I have kept the spicing simple here, but you could also include allspice, peppercorns and coriander seeds in your spice mix.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>400g lamb mince</strong><br><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>1 onion</strong>, peeled<strong><br>3 tbsp olive oil<br>2 tsp cumin<br>2 tsp cinnamon<br>1 tsp </strong><strong>aleppo chilli flakes<br>3 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled, 2 finely chopped, 1 crushed<strong><br>4 tbsp pomegranate molasses<br>150g radishes</strong>, quartered<br><strong>Tahini</strong>, to serve (optional)</p> <p>For the flatbreads<br><strong>250g </strong><strong>flour</strong> (I use spelt), plus extra for dusting<br><strong>2 tsp baking powder<br>1 tsp salt<br>2 tsp nigella seeds<br></strong><strong>190g yoghurt</strong></p> <p>For the cucumber yoghurt<br><strong>200g yoghurt<br>½ cucumber</strong>, cut into small cubes<br><strong>1 small handful mint leaves</strong><br><br></p> <p>First make the dough. In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients, then add the yoghurt. Pull together into a ball, tip on to a floured surface and knead for two minutes. Now rest in a lightly oiled bowl covered with a damp tea towel.</p> <p>Season the lamb mince with salt and black pepper. Finely chop the onion and warm a large pan over a medium-high heat. Add half the oil followed by the mince, onions and spices, and saute for six to eight minutes. Add the two finely chopped garlic cloves, cook for a further two to three minutes, then add the pomegranate molasses and 200ml water, and cook for 10 minutes, until the lamb looks sticky and glossy. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</p> <p>Mix the yoghurt with the remaining olive oil, the crushed garlic clove and the cucumber, then season, chop half the mint and stir it in.</p> <p>To cook the flatbreads, warm a large pan over a high heat. Divide the dough into six balls and roll each out on a floured surface to 15-20cm – the thinner, the better. Once the pan is smoking hot, cook each flatbread for a few minutes on each side until puffed up and blistered.</p> <p>Serve immediately with the spiced lamb, a generous spoonful of cucumber yoghurt, the radishes and remaining whole mint leaves; a drizzle of tahini is also delicious.</p> <h2>The simple flex</h2> <p>For a vegan version, saute plant-based mince instead of the lamb and dress with tahini thinned down with water, lemon juice, garlic and seasoning, handfuls of herbs and lemon wedges, and a cucumber salad instead of the yoghurt.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 August 2022 to remove a suggestion to use “Quorn mince” for a vegan version.

Amini hopes they can find accommodation not too far from where they are living in the hotel now, so that the children can continue to attend the same schools. Their education has been a beacon of stability in a year of enormous upheaval.</p> <p>But searches for accommodation in the area of west London where they are staying have so far proved fruitless. Affordable rented accommodation in London for a family of six is in short supply.</p> <p>In February this year Amini, 48, and her family were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/does-not-seem-possible-londoner-who-wants-house-afghan-refugee\">offered a flat in the right area</a> by a woman who had come to the UK decades ago as a refugee and wanted to help others. But bureaucratic roadblocks meant the family were unable to move in.</p> <p>The family were anxious when they received letters from the Home Office and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities a few days ago stating: “It is now possible for you to find your own accommodation.”</p> <p>Amini said that while families were eager to move out of the hotels because the conditions were very difficult, especially for families with small children and for people who are old or sick, the logistics were challenging.</p> <p>“We have been living in this hotel for nine months. We are very grateful for it but it’s hard to live in a hotel for such a long time,” she said. “Sometimes our emotions are not good. We are crying when we remember our families in Afghanistan. The families living in this hotel invite each other into their rooms. Mothers celebrate their small children’s birthdays in the hotel bedrooms. We want to find a house but we know the search for one will be very difficult.”</p> <p>Hasina Safi, the acting minister for women in the Afghan government from May 2020 until August 2021, is staying in a hotel just outside London with her husband, their three children aged 14, 16 and 22, and other close family members. The family have been in the hotel for almost a year, having arrived in the UK on 26 August last year. She said the family would like to be in their own home, but the hotel was catering for their day-to-day needs.</p> <p>“We were in a very critical and dangerous situation in Afghanistan, a matter of life or death. It’s not a time here in the UK to enjoy life. It’s simply a matter of being alive,” she said. “The younger two children are settled at school and the administration at the school has been very supportive.”</p> <p>Maryam, 42, is the director of a leading Afghan women’s organisation, which works for the empowerment of women in her home country. Working online from her UK hotel room, she is trying to keep the organisation going and to support women in her home country as much as possible. She and her husband, their three children aged six, four and one, her parents and her sisters initially escaped from Afghanistan to Albania, where they stayed for four and a half months. They have lived in hotel rooms for the last six months.</p> <p>“Of course we are grateful for all the support we have received in the UK but a hotel is not home,” she said. “My baby has grown up in hotels. The hotel rooms are very small and the older children remember our house in Afghanistan and ask where it is. They want to go back there.”</p> <p>She said many of the women in the hotel were suffering. “They cry a lot and go to the medical centre a lot. They say they were much happier when they were living in Afghanistan before the Taliban took control. These women are part of large families but now they are just sitting in a hotel room with their children.</p> <p>“Some of the women who have small children are scared to come out of their rooms because they’ve heard that parents in the UK who don’t take care of their children properly have them taken away.</p> <p>“We are worried about finding a house to live in because we know the housing market in the UK is very difficult and rents are very high. We are not here by choice.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/aug/15/milan-begin-title-defence-in-style-as-inter-leave-it-late-in-serie-a","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T11:40:30Z","webTitle":"Milan begin title defence in style as Inter leave it late in Serie A | Nicky Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/15/milan-begin-title-defence-in-style-as-inter-leave-it-late-in-serie-a","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/aug/15/milan-begin-title-defence-in-style-as-inter-leave-it-late-in-serie-a","fields":{"headline":"Milan begin title defence in style as Inter leave it late in Serie A","trailText":"On an opening weekend of thrills and spills, Milan looked far more self-assured than their city rivals even as both sides won","byline":"Nicky Bandini","body":"<p>The only thing missing from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/11/serie-a-inter-juve-milan-preview-lukaku-pogba\">Serie A’s opening weekend</a> was a bleary-eyed traveller bursting into the room and demanding to know what year it is. Rodrigo Becão scoring a header against Milan? How did a story this unlikely get stuck on repeat? The Udinese centre-back’s three goals in four seasons against the <em>Rossoneri</em> are more than he has managed against every other opponent combined in his professional career.</p> \n<p>Six hundred miles away, Romelu Lukaku netted on his Inter debut against Lecce, exactly as he did when he joined for the first time in 2019. The shirt on his back has changed from No 9 to No 90, and that was about how many seconds he needed to make history recur, heading home from close range to open the scoring at the Stadio Via del Mare.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/15/for-almeria-even-the-almighty-cannot-hold-real-madrid-off-forever-la-liga\">For Almería, even the almighty cannot hold Real Madrid off forever | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One day later, Ionut Radu found himself trapped in a less happy rerun. The goalkeeper swapped Inter for Cremonese in the summer, seeking a fresh start with a newly promoted side after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORy1ee7dmaw&amp;ab_channel=BTSport\">his howler against Bologna</a> cost the <em>Nerazzurri</em> control of last season’s title race. But after a mostly strong performance against Fiorentina, he blundered again, dropping a cross at the feet of an opponent in the 95th minute to squander a hard-earned point.</p> \n<p>It was a weekend of fast starts and late drama. Becão’s goal was the first of the season, arriving in the second minute at San Siro, but did not unsettle the reigning champs. Milan equalised from a contentious penalty and led through Ante Rebic before allowing themselves to be pegged back by an Adam Masina goal just before half-time.</p> \n<p>That same player would gift them a chance to reclaim their advantage after the interval, failing to deal with a cross at the back post. Brahim Díaz pounced to punish his mistake and the Spaniard then set up Rebic to seal a 4-2 win, nutmegging Bram Nuytinck and serving his teammate an invitation to finish on the edge of the six-yard box.</p> \n<p>Milan were not perfect, but which team is on day one? There was sloppy defending at both ends and Rebic ought to have done a better job of tracking Becão on Udinese’s opener, but his two goals more than made up for it. That is already enough to match his entire tally for an injury-riddled 2021-22 campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b7a60d42b0865865342053967a53df65c499d1a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b7a60d42b0865865342053967a53df65c499d1a/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Udinese and Milan line up before kick-off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Udinese and Milan line up before kick-off.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Stefano Pioli was able to give second-half debuts to Divock Origi, Tommaso Pobega and Charles De Ketelaere without compromising a win over opponents who took four points off his team last season. The manager reflected afterwards that his team had complicated things with their early sloppiness, but it was certainly a more confident performance than Inter managed at Lecce.</p> \n<p>Since Lukaku returned, the <em>Nerazzurri</em> have been listed as favourites to win the Scudetto, but struggled in spite of his early goal. Perhaps they were complacent against opponents for whom seven starters were making their Serie A debuts. Certainly, a heavy pitch did them no favours.</p> \n<p>Yet newly promoted Lecce faced those same conditions and showed greater courage for much of the first hour, the 23-year-old Danish midfielder Morten Hjulmand carrying the fight in midfield with the Brazilian Gabriel Strefezza a whirlwind and menacing chaos on the right. Their equaliser arrived from the opposite flank, when Assan Ceesay – a free signing from FC Zürich – swapped passes with Federico Di Francesco and ran through to score at the start of the second half.</p> \n<p>Lecce could even have gone ahead, Samir Handanovic making a brilliant reflex save to keep out Kristijan Bistrovic’s deflected free-kick. Simone Inzaghi responded by throwing every Inter attacker on the pitch all at once, Lukaku and Lautaro Martínez joined by Edin Dzeko and Joaquín Correa, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan behind.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Inter/status/1558851467074846721\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"it\" dir=\"ltr\">E alla fine arriva <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DenzelJMD2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DenzelJMD2</a> 😁<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForzaInter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ForzaInter</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LecceInter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LecceInter</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/tGMHNEcI98\">pic.twitter.com/tGMHNEcI98</a></p>— Inter (@Inter) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Inter/status/1558851467074846721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 14, 2022</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It was instead the wing-back Denzel Dumfries, another second-half introduction, who scored the winner in the 94th minute, using his chest to redirect Martínez’s header into the net from a corner and seal a 2-1 win.

Not that the <em>Giallorossi</em> would mind in that instance. If he or Nicolò Zaniolo had been a little more clinical their margin of victory could have been much wider on Sunday night.</p> \n<p>It was a very different story for Fiorentina, who could count themselves lucky to take three points at all. They led 2-1 at half-time against Cremonese, who were reduced to 10 men when Gonzalo Escalante was sent off in the 43rd minute. Better yet for the <em>Viola</em>, Luka Jovic had opened his account with a well-taken goal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"161c6ffc49675201e944dad9991ae881d3667f2f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/161c6ffc49675201e944dad9991ae881d3667f2f/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luka Jovic scores Fiorentina’s second.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luka Jovic scores Fiorentina’s second.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ciancaphoto Studio/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the man advantage, though, Fiorentina let their lead slip. Pierluigi Gollini was caught out of position at a corner, forced to retreat rapidly and claw the ball out as it swung in towards goal.

Choreographic duo Morgann Runacre-Temple and Jessica Wright have achieved that in Coppélia, one of the most twee of 19th-century ballets, reimagined as a modern cautionary tale with elements of thriller, satire and philosophical inquiry.</p> <p>In the original, Dr Coppélius creates a life-sized doll that catches the eye of Swanhilda’s fiance. Here the bones of the story stay the same, but the setting is pure Silicon Valley. Coppélius (Bruno Micchiardi) is a black polo-neck clad tech guru with giant ego and a model of a space rocket in his study – in case we were in any doubt we’re in Elon Musk territory.

What this bivalent vaccine gives us is a sharpened tool in our armoury to help protect us against this disease as the virus continues to evolve.</p> <p>“We have in place a comprehensive safety surveillance strategy for monitoring the safety of all UK-approved Covid-19 vaccines and this will include the vaccine approved today.”</p> <p>Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, which independently reviewed the vaccine data, said the commission agreed with the MHRA’s decision.</p> <p>“The virus, Sars-CoV-2, is continually evolving in order to evade the immunity provided by vaccines. This novel bivalent vaccine represents the next step in the development of vaccines to combat the virus, with its ability to lead to a broader immune response than the original vaccine,” he said.</p> <p>The MHRA said an exploratory analysis of the bivalent vaccine had shown it generated a good immune response against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. <a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Modernas-Omicron-Containing-Bivalent-Booster-Candidate-mRNA-1273.214-Demonstrates-Significantly-Higher-Neutralizing-Antibody-Response-Against-Omicron-Subvariants-BA.45-Compared-To-Currently-Authorized-Booster/default.aspx\">According to Moderna</a>, trial participants who were given the booster had antibody levels against these subvariants that were 1.69 times higher than those given the original booster.</p> <p>BA.4 and BA.5 fuelled the most recent Covid wave in the UK, and have caused infections, breakthrough reinfections, deaths and disruption around the world.</p> <p>But Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, suggested the vaccine may not offer huge gains in the fight against these subvariants.</p> <p>“This is a really difficult juncture for all policymakers in terms of vaccine booster procurement and booster programmes,” he said.</p> <p>“We lack the certainties we had in early 2020 of which way to go with the vaccines, not least, how to keep up with evolution of the variants. BA.5 is highly immune evasive so that even boosted people have highly impaired protection. Even exposure to the original Omicron sequence – as used in this, new, bivalent vaccine booster – only gives a rather marginal advantage to the antibody response.” </p> <p>He said that meant the outlook was complex. “We’re in a terribly vulnerable position heading into the winter, so any booster programme is better than nothing, and this bivalent booster almost certainly an improvement over the first-generation vaccines.</p> <p>“My view is that this approach offers a marginal improvement in our battle against BA.5, but actually, we still need to think harder about this and look more broadly at the diverse vaccine candidates.

They met us as babies and watched us grow up. They knew our stories, those of our siblings, our parents and often our grandparents, too. These stories were fundamental to the bond of trust between doctors and their patients. We are now learning that this deep, accumulated knowledge was also palpably beneficial in medical terms.</p> <p>The stories came in fragments, of course. Any GP will tell you this: that alongside the medical history, there are glimpses of the life that accompanies it: a past trauma, a triumph, a family crisis, a morbid fear or a reason to hope. Reducing any patient to their affliction, the tumorous breast or lazy pancreas, is akin to regarding a book as nothing more than paper and ink.</p> <p>This focus on the whole person, while valuable in all medical disciplines, is bread-and-butter work for GPs. Their role as the keeper of patients’ stories is what most of them love about their job, or what they used to. Because the world has turned, and with it the dynamics of primary care. Few of us attending the doctors’ surgery these days expect to see the same GP twice. We don’t know our doctors like we used to, and they don’t know us, a situation only compounded by Covid and the default to remote consultation. Shared stories have, in many cases, given way to medical transactions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As patient numbers have risen, speed of access to a doctor – any doctor – has become the overriding priority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even before the pandemic, doctor-patient relationships were in serious trouble. A mobile population, a shortage of doctors, overwhelming workloads, the move towards part-time working (for many GPs, the only way to endure the pressures of the job), bigger practices, larger teams: all of this gnawed away at the humanity of primary care. Meanwhile, the rise of evidence-based medicine has seen a shift towards the management of health risk via a playbook of standardised interventions. While this has driven progress in the treatment of many illnesses, it’s had unintended consequences for the relationship between GPs and their patients. Precisely because the value of those relationships is difficult to render in cold, hard figures, performance metrics are skewed towards outcomes that are easier to quantify. The emphasis, and indeed the measure of success, has shifted from the individual patient to the disease.</p> <p>As patient numbers have risen, speed of access to a doctor – any doctor – has become the overriding priority, the policy goal to eclipse all others. Continuity is still nominally the gold standard, but the system is no longer designed to support it. It doesn’t even feature in the framework of payment incentives for GPs. Care based on narrative, relational principles is increasingly regarded as a luxury, a throwback to the days of Dr Finlay’s Casebook; in other words, ill-suited to 21st-century healthcare, a video rental store “in the age of Netflix”, as the former health secretary put it in June.</p> <p>I know this not because I am a doctor myself, but because I’ve spent the last two years studying one. Over many months, I observed a remarkable female GP at work in the same rural practice portrayed in A Fortunate Man, John Berger’s classic account of a country GP in the mid 1960s. In the course of around 130,000 patient encounters over more than 20 years, she has built something that many doctors no longer enjoy: high-quality, longstanding relationships with her patients.</p> <p>A compelling storyteller in her own right, she told me during our first interview: “Yes, it’s important to examine people, but you work out what’s going on from the stories. And if people know you and trust you, and you give them time to talk, they give you gems of critically important medical information.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/01/the-big-idea-do-nations-really-need-borders\">The big idea: do nations really need borders?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because of course the relationship between doctor and patient is not simply a nice-to-have. It saves lives. A growing body of research links seeing the same doctor over time to a <a href=\"https://www.continuitycounts.com/the-evidence\" title=\"\">number of significant benefits</a>: greater patient satisfaction, closer adherence to medical advice and medication, better uptake of vaccines, reduced use of out-of-hours services, lower referral rates, better job satisfaction and retention of doctors, fewer A&amp;E admissions, even, according to a large-scale <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/72/715/e84.long\" title=\"\">study</a> from Norway published last year, a reduction of up to 25% in mortality among patients for whom there was long‑term continuity of care. As Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, told me: “If relationships were a drug, guideline developers would mandate their use.”</p> <p>In May, the Commons Health and Social Care Committee held an <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/10263/pdf/\" title=\"\">evidence session</a> on continuity of care. They heard from Dr Jacob Lee about what it’s like to see someone in a practice that doesn’t have personal lists. “You are trying to read their notes and get a feeling for what has been happening in the past. It makes the consultation really challenging when you are looking at blood test results and letters for patients you do not know because they are split between the different GPs who are in that day. It is so inefficient and difficult to try to do a good job for that individual.”</p> <p>This will have an impact on all of us at some point. But without more widespread recognition of the problem, we might not even notice what we are missing out on. A longitudinal <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/71/707/e432\" title=\"\">study</a> of continuity of primary care in England published in 2021 showed that not only were fewer patients able to see their preferred GP, but fewer even <em>had</em> a preferred GP in the first place.

At present, the majority of cases in current outbreaks are among men who have sex with men.</p> <p>Vaccination with a jab initially developed to protect against smallpox, a related but more serious disease, is among the measures being taken to control infections. </p> <p>However, while experts stress that it is important for those at risk of monkeypox to take up the offer of a vaccination, as it reduces the chance of symptomatic infection and severe illness, protection offered by a smallpox jab may decline over time. A <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01436-2/fulltext#section-3d6acba1-acea-4be2-8dc9-b7e14e5b6583\">study into monkeypox cases</a> in Spain revealed that 32 of the 181 patients had previously received a childhood vaccination against smallpox.</p> <p>Dr Oriol Mitja, co-author of the research, said that since most participants who had been vaccinated against smallpox received the jab more than 45 years ago, it is reasonable to predict that their protection would have waned. “All I can say is that childhood vaccinations may not protect 100% for life,” he said.</p> <p>Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, and who was not involved with the work, agreed.</p> <p>He suggested that there could be a number of reasons at play, including that while the viruses are similar they are not identical, “so the cross-protection provided may not absolute”, he said.</p> <p>Furthermore, Whitworth noted that the study relied largely on self-reported smallpox vaccination, meaning there may have been inaccuracies.</p> <p>However, Mitja said most clinicians had also checked scars, vaccination cards, or the patient had asked his mother.</p> <p>Another possibility, said Whitworth, is that HIV may play a role. According to the study, 40% of the monkeypox cases were in people who were HIV positive. Mitja said the figure was 60% among those who had childhood smallpox vaccination but still got monkeypox. “[People with HIV] may have had some immunodeficiency, eroding away the protection from the vaccine,” said Whitworth.</p> <p>Laura Waters, the chair of the British HIV Association, agreed. “Though it is likely smallpox vaccine effectiveness wanes in everyone, it’s feasible that this would occur to a greater degree in people with HIV, even those with well-controlled HIV on treatment,” she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/benefits-of-smallpox-vaccine-lost-in-hiv-patients-despite-art#:~:text=HIV%20patients%20who%20were%20previously,according%20to%20a%20recent%20study.\">Research from scientists in the US</a>, published in 2020, found immune responses to childhood smallpox vaccination declined faster among people who subsequently became infected with HIV.</p> <p>Prof Mark Slifka, of Oregon Health &amp; Science University, said: “This is a potential concern that may explain why there could be more monkeypox breakthrough cases in these current outbreaks.” </p> <p>But he urged caution in interpreting the data from Spain, noting that the childhood smallpox vaccine might still have provided partial immunity towards monkeypox.</p> <p>“We also don’t know if the cases among previously vaccinated individuals was less severe compared to those who were not previously vaccinated,” Slifka said, noting another study by his team looking at an earlier monkeypox outbreak in the US suggested childhood smallpox vaccination reduced the chance of catching monkeypox.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Terrence Higgins Trust said more research is needed on the effectiveness of the vaccine in people with HIV, adding that the charity is calling for the UK Health Security Agency to investigate whether people with HIV need a second dose of the vaccine. Limited supplies of the vaccine mean that at present <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-vaccination-resources/monkeypox-waiting-for-your-vaccination\">only one dose is being offered</a> to those at risk of monkeypox.</p> <p>The smallpox vaccine being used in many countries, including in the UK, is not the same as the one given decades ago. Known as Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, the jab does not contain live virus, unlike earlier vaccines, making it safe for people with HIV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Carlos Maluquer de Motes, a virologist at the University of Surrey, said the current monkeypox outbreak would offer important data on how long immunity offered by the smallpox vaccine lasts.</p> <p>“No studies have been able to measure ‘real’ protection from [smallpox] simply because there was no disease once smallpox was eradicated,” he said. With monkeypox closely related to smallpox, the current outbreak could offer fresh insights.</p> <p>Dr Maluquer de Motes added: “Whilst we think most individuals are protected, natural individual-to-individual variation in vaccine response efficacy is to be expected and some individuals may still be susceptible to monkeypox disease. This picture will emerge as numbers increase and larger studies are conducted.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/wildfires-europe-burn-area-equivalent-one-fifth-belgium","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T11:25:16Z","webTitle":"Wildfires in Europe burn area equivalent to one-fifth of Belgium ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/wildfires-europe-burn-area-equivalent-one-fifth-belgium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/wildfires-europe-burn-area-equivalent-one-fifth-belgium","fields":{"headline":"Wildfires in Europe burn area equivalent to one-fifth of Belgium ","trailText":"Experts say drought and extreme high temperatures likely to make it a record year for destruction by fires","byline":"Jon Henley Europe correspondent","body":"<p>Across Europe, an area equivalent to one-fifth of Belgium has been ravaged by flames as successive searing heatwaves and a historic drought propel the continent towards what experts say is likely to be a record year for wildfire destruction.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/effis.statistics/seasonaltrend?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=94014bfbbd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_08_15_03_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-94014bfbbd-189498069\">data from the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis)</a>, 659,541 hectares (1.6m acres) of land burned across the continent between January and mid-August, the most at this time of year since records began in 2006.</p> \n<p>The figure is 56% higher than the previous record in 2017.

Tuchel said the “whole dressing room” has a problem with Taylor, who has a history of infuriating Chelsea with his decisions. He went on to question whether the 43-year-old referee should be barred from taking charge of the club’s games. </p> \n<p>The comments from Tuchel come less than a year after more than 80,000 Chelsea fans signed a petition calling for Taylor to be removed from their club’s fixtures.</p> \n<p>The official has shown more yellow cards to Chelsea players than those from any other team. He has also shown red cards to Reece James and Mateo Kovacic and was criticised for failing to punish Manchester United’s Harry Maguire for an apparent stamp on Michy Batshuayi in February 2020.</p> \n<p>That history bled into the game on Sunday. Tuchel’s first eruption came when Taylor decided not to penalise a Rodrigo Bentancur challenge on Kai Havertz in the buildup to Pierre-Emile Højbjerg making it 1-1 midway through the second half. He also argued the goal should have been ruled out for offside against Richarlison.</p> \n<p>However Mike Dean, the video assistant referee, decided the Spurs striker was not interfering with play and that his positioning had not affected Édouard Mendy’s ability to save Højbjerg’s shot. </p> \n<p>Tuchel complained about the failure to give Havertz a free-kick and then clashed with Conte on the touchline. The managers had to be pulled apart and then received bookings.</p> \n<p>Tuchel was later spoken to by the fourth official after charging down the touchline to celebrate James putting Chelsea 2-1 up.</p> \n<p>The atmosphere on the touchline was intense and Chelsea were aggrieved when, before the corner that led to Harry Kane equalising in the sixth minute of added time, Dean did not instruct Taylor to dismiss the Spurs centre‑back Cristian Romero for pulling Marc Cucurella’s hair.</p> \n<p>Taylor had not seen the incident in real time and Dean’s view was that Romero had not committed a red‑card offence. The Argentinian will not face retrospective action from the FA.</p> \n<p>However, Tuchel does have a case to answer after his comments about Taylor. It was put to him that Chelsea fans have historical grievances with Taylor. “I don’t think that just some of the fans think that,” he said. “I can assure you that the whole dressing room, every single person thinks that.</p> \n<p>“I cannot understand how the first goal is not offside. And I cannot understand since when players can pull other people’s hair and stay on the pitch and attack in the last corner.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/thomas-tuchel-suggests-anthony-taylor-should-not-referee-chelsea-again\">Thomas Tuchel suggests Anthony Taylor should not referee Chelsea again</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tuchel, who said his players worry about Taylor, was asked whether the referee should be kept away from Chelsea. “Maybe that would be better,” he said. “Maybe it would be better but we also have VAR to help make the right decisions.”</p> \n<p>Tuchel made light of his clash with Conte, but he is expected to miss the trip to Leeds on Sunday after his red card. “I cannot coach but the referee can whistle the next game,” he said. “Good.”</p> \n<p>Conte, who also played down the row, faces the prospect of being banned for Spurs’ home game against Wolves.

It was not clear how soon an appeal could be heard.</p> <p>A formal appeal may indicate that no political deal has been reached for a prisoner swap involving Griner between Russia and the US. Russian officials have said that they would consider an exchange but only after Griner’s appeal process had been exhausted and her sentence came into effect.</p> <p>Blagovolina and Boykov said after the conviction that the sentence was excessive and that in similar cases defendants have received an average sentence of about five years, with about a third of them granted parole.</p> <p>Griner admitted that she had the cannabis oil canisters in her luggage, but said she had inadvertently packed them in haste and that she had no criminal intent. Her defence team presented written statements that she had been prescribed cannabis to treat pain.</p> <p>Before her conviction, the US state department declared Griner to be wrongfully detained.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, took the unusual step of revealing publicly in July that the US had made a “substantial proposal” to get Griner home, along with Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for espionage.

They told the Guardian that Taliban fighters have barred them from even short journeys, including commuting to work, sometimes using indirect tactics such as threatening drivers who take solo female passengers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3469909c27d3ec8b8cb23bba284d366cbfca3bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3469909c27d3ec8b8cb23bba284d366cbfca3bc/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man walks past a vandalised mural depicting a group of women in Kabul\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man walks past a vandalised mural depicting a group of women in Kabul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nava Jamshidi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Health workers said they had personal experience of women being barred from accessing medical help without a mahram in at least two districts, one in central Afghanistan’s Bamiyan province and one in southern Helmand.</p> <p>These extreme controls fuel the fears of women such as Wazhma, even about journeys that should be legal, like taking her mother to hospital in Kabul.</p> <p>She used to have a senior government job, travelling abroad and extensively across Afghanistan. Since the Taliban ordered most female civil servants to stay away from work and then advised women not to leave home <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1117762\">except in cases of necessity</a>, she can count on her hands the number of times she has left her own neighbourhood.</p> <p>“Because of my mother’s situation I want to take her abroad to a better hospital, but I don’t dare to. I know that if I travel far they are likely to stop me,” she said, adding that she found the situation unbearable.</p> <p>“I can’t tolerate this. I am a person who studied and worked all these years, now an illiterate man can stop me, ask questions, argue with me, and I cannot argue with him.”</p> <p>Students who have won scholarships abroad are consumed with anxiety about whether they will be allowed to board their flights without a mahram, group WhatsApp chats shared with the Guardian showed.</p> <p>A husband, brother, father, son or nephew can fulfil the role of mahram. But after decades of war, Afghanistan has an estimated 2 million widows who may not have a living father, brother or son able or willing to serve as their mahram. Divorced and unmarried women face similar problems.</p> <p>Some women gamble on escaping detection, ignoring rules they say make no sense. “I will take the risk and go, and I know they will react, but what should I do?” said one young activist, who still travels alone for work. “If I don’t have a mahram, where should I find one? I can’t just buy one, or ask a Talib to be my mahram.”</p> <p>The Taliban solution to the clash between laws that deny women autonomy and the daily struggles of many women without guardians is to deny there is a problem.</p> <p>“They must have someone,” Sadeq Akif Muhajir, a spokesperson for the ministry for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice <a href=\"https://rukhshana.com/en/taliban-banned-womens-travel-without-mahram\">told Rukhsana Media</a> recently. “They have brothers or nephews.”</p> <p>Hasina has a brother and Wazhma an uncle who could be their official guardians, but both have made clear they want no financial responsibility for their relatives and will not escort them to a border post to leave the country.</p> <p>“He’s not here to take any responsibility or to support us, he is just here for his own goal and when that’s achieved he will go back,” Wazhma said of her uncle, who recently returned from Iran to sell a shared family home where she has lived with her mum and sister since her father’s death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"627d6c29f81447c409a57b0ab8d2b9fe0e4a2298\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/627d6c29f81447c409a57b0ab8d2b9fe0e4a2298/209_650_5607_3366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women cover their faces while walking down a street in Kabul\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officially, any woman travelling more than 75km (46 miles) or leaving the country needs a mahram.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nava Jamshidi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others have family members who have stepped up, but at a price for everyone. Kamila* lived with just her sister and mother until last August. Now her nephew, 17, sleeps at their house, even though he misses his own mother who is on the other side of the city.</p> <p>“Before the Taliban came we were living here by ourselves,” Kamila said. “We weren’t afraid of anything. Now it has become very scary for us, we know the Taliban only value men.”</p> <p>The mahram rule has also contributed to an economic catastrophe for families without adult men, amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/afghanistan-ngo-assets-unfrozen-end-near-universal-poverty\">broader economic collapse</a>. The regulations make it harder or more frightening for women to find jobs, or commute to work.</p> <p>Hasina used to make a decent living as a tailor but struggles now because she is frightened of going out on her own. “I wait for clients to come here so I can sew their clothes at home,” she says. Inevitably her income has dropped.</p> <p>“I don’t dare go far from this street, and I haven’t been beyond this area since the Taliban came. I heard that when they find out about families without a mahram, they are taking women away. Even if I found a job outside the home I wouldn’t take it.”</p> <p>It also distorts family relationships. An unlucky minority are forced to rely on their young sons to fulfil the role of their “protector”, skewing the normal dynamic between mother and child.</p> <p>“According to the rules of the Taliban a boy over seven can be a mahram;, isn’t it stupid of them to think that a seven-year-old can defend their mother or stop something bad happening?” said Sahar*, a widow and mother of seven girls and three boys, the oldest just 12.</p> <p>“They value a boy and hold a woman as nothing. They want to isolate us. And [being given this power] affects the boys. You can even feel it in our family,” she says. “Islam gives lots of rights to women, but the Taliban have grabbed them all away.</p> <p>“At the moment, Afghan women are all alone, even if you want to support us, you can’t do it.

The two were close. “He was my best mate,” says Hammans, a 52-year-old pharmaceutical production manager from Haywards Heath.</p> <p>Lewis was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that causes muscles to weaken over time, at the age of four. “He didn’t have the mobility other children in his nursery had,” says Hammans. </p> <p>Both supported Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC – Hammans took Lewis to games from an early age. In 2008, Hammans spotted an advert for powerchair football, run by <a href=\"https://albioninthecommunity.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Albion in the Community</a>, the club’s official charity. They attended an introductory session and for Lewis, it was love at first sight.</p> <p>Powerchair football is played in teams of four, and games are 40 minutes long. All use modified electric wheelchairs, with bumpers on the front that players use to punt the football around the pitch. Initially, the games were recreational, but “a core of players wanted to take it a bit further”, says Hammans, and so Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Powerchair FC was born.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I genuinely love the game – it’s a great sport.

The team entered the national championship in 2011, and under Hammans they worked their way into the Premiership, and were invited to compete in the Champions League in Denmark in 2016. “We did lots of video analysis,” says Hammans, “and modelled our game on the best teams’ play.”</p> <p>From 2011 to 2019, Hammans and the team<strong> </strong>would travel regularly to Nottingham Trent University, to compete in the Powerchair League. The team would stay in a hotel and eat together on the Friday and Saturday nights,<strong> </strong>then Lewis and Hammans would drive home on Sunday, dissecting the game all the way back.<strong> </strong>“It was about the social side,” says Hammans. “Carers and players got on really well.”</p> <p>But it was also about the game. Lewis could be a hothead. “When he was getting too fiery I’d have to substitute him,” Hammans laughs. “That was not popular with him. He didn’t get special treatment from me, that’s for sure.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"daa92dc375cc18363066637be24084c3d4f0bd82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daa92dc375cc18363066637be24084c3d4f0bd82/0_42_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Hammans with his special water filter hose\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Hammans with his special water filter hose.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lewis played powerchair football until he died in October 2019. He suffered seven heart attacks over one weekend. Doctors revived him each time and admitted him to intensive care. It was during the football season. “He said,” remembers Hammans, “‘We need to play next Saturday. I don’t mind sitting on the bench. But we have to get to Nottingham.’ I said, ‘We aren’t going anywhere, Lewis’.”</p> <p>Lewis died the following Tuesday. He was 20 years old. “It was very unexpected,” says Hammans. “I thought he’d have another 10 years. And you always have your fingers crossed that they might find something – that glimmer of hope.”</p> <p>The team didn’t play again until February 2020. “That first game without Lewis was tough,’’ says Hammans. “My wife came to Nottingham with me, for support.” Why go on coaching the team after his son’s death? “I genuinely love the game,” he says. “It’s a great sport.

He would chat all the way home about how he scored this goal and did that. So that is hard. But I still look forward to the weekends. Get up there on Friday, go out, have a good time. It’s fun. And what else would I be doing, apart from washing the car?”</p> <p>And it’s this car that Hammans thinks of when asked what he’d like for his treat. It has a special connection to Lewis:<strong> </strong>Hammans bought his Audi A3 with money from an insurance claim, after the family was involved in an accident years earlier. The money was earmarked for Lewis, but he died before the claim was settled. “My wife said, ‘Lewis would want you to have a car,’” says Hammans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every weekend, Hammans washes the car, and had been longing for a special crystal water filter, to provide deionised water that dries without leaving water marks.

The successful introduction of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/148141/Green-Book-Chapter-26-Polio-updated-18-January-2013.pdf\">polio vaccine in 1956</a> into the UK, and later more widely, has resulted in the elimination of this once dreaded disease from Europe and indeed most of the world. After the successful global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/feb/13/smallpox-virus-vector-health-terror\">eradication of smallpox</a> in 1980, polio is the next human disease on the list targeted for eradication.</p> <p>But for all the progress, we are not there yet. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/polio-case-new-york-4c1e2512145a1d897982f27507259d83\">first case of paralytic polio</a> in almost a decade was reported in New York state in July, and a few days later vaccine-derived virus was reported to have been <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/04/polioviruses-found-in-wastewater-samples-in-2-n-y-counties-suggesting-continued-spread/\">found in sewage</a> in a neighbouring county. A related virus has now been reported in multiple samples of London sewage, prompting authorities in the capital to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/all-children-aged-1-to-9-in-london-to-be-offered-a-dose-of-polio-vaccine\">offer a polio vaccine booster dose</a> to every child between the age of one and nine. This year Israel has had its <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/first-new-polio-case-in-decades-diagnosed-in-israel/\">first case of polio</a> since 1989. </p> <p>Over time, the threats from infectious diseases have reduced, but the need for vigilance never has. During the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, routine childhood <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/15-07-2022-covid-19-pandemic-fuels-largest-continued-backslide-in-vaccinations-in-three-decades\">immunisation rates fell</a> around the world, including in the UK, and they have not totally recovered.</p> <p>The public health measures introduced – including increased handwashing, mask-wearing and physical distancing – resulted in a reduction in cases of some infectious diseases, including some that are vaccine-preventable. However, the pandemic also gave rise to conspiracy theories, including in relation to Covid-19 vaccines. Although these were espoused by a small minority of people in the UK, they were very vocal, received a lot of media coverage and there was an increase in vaccine scepticism generally, creating a perfect storm. An increase in the number of unimmunised people, a lack of background boosting of immunity from natural infection and dropping the public health measures means there is a very real danger that we will see increased rates of some of the diseases currently controlled by vaccination.</p> <p>So how to respond? The resurgence of polio and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/23/what-is-monkeypox\">spread of monkeypox </a>reminds us that infectious diseases do not respect national borders. As well as a moral duty, it is in our own interests to ensure that infectious diseases are controlled as effectively as possible across the globe. For polio this is only possible through vaccination. Yet, the UK government has cut its contribution to the global polio eradication effort. While it is understandable that all budgets are being reviewed in these financially stretched times, this is no time to slash something as vital as polio eradication. MPs need to be made aware of this change and its damaging effects.</p> <p>Closer to home, we need to ensure that there is ready access to accurate information about vaccines and the diseases they prevent. Along with polio, most people will have had no experience of diseases such as diphtheria, which before the introduction of vaccination in the 1940s would kill thousands every year in UK.</p> <p>It is often said that the success of a vaccination programme is its own worst enemy, as success equals no or little disease and hence not only is the reminder of the severity of the disease removed, but people consider vaccination to be no longer necessary. The current situation is a sharp reminder that this is not the case. Convincing some people to accept a vaccine (Covid-19) to protect against a pandemic disease that was killing literally millions of people in real time was challenging enough. It is even more difficult, perhaps, to encourage some of the public to accept a vaccine for a disease that has virtually died out.</p> <p>But it is not impossible, as evidenced by high uptake of the vaccine in the UK as a whole, with <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/vaccination-coverage-for-children-and-mothers-1#background\">over 90% of 12-month-old children</a> receiving three doses of the primary vaccines including polio. The cause for concern is the large disparity in uptake between areas, with almost <a href=\"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTI3NWZhNzItMTIyZS00OWM2LTg0MzMtOGY5YTJjMGY0MjI1IiwidCI6IjUwZjYwNzFmLWJiZmUtNDAxYS04ODAzLTY3Mzc0OGU2MjllMiIsImMiOjh9\">a third of 12-month-old children</a> in some parts of London not fully protected. This huge gap in immunity leaves potential for spread of devastating diseases including polio.</p> <p>Minimising this vaccine uptake gap relies on several key factors. The public require reliable, accurate and timely information in whatever form works best for them: written, digital or verbal. Many people need a conversation with a well-informed health professional whom they trust to discuss the pros and cons of the vaccine and answer their concerns; this takes time, which is at a premium in the NHS. For polio, the discussion is clear-cut: it is a devastating disease that can be effectively prevented by a very safe, well-established vaccine.</p> <p>However, for some people the barriers to vaccination are more practical. It is well recognised that younger children in large families, as well as those living in more disadvantaged circumstances, are less likely to be vaccinated. The practical difficulties of accessing vaccination clinics with multiple conflicting priorities to manage may, despite best intentions, leave vaccination low on the list. It may be too costly to take time off work or pay for travel to the clinic. Vaccination becomes a low priority in the face of worries about the rapidly rising cost of living. This puts the ball firmly in the NHS’s court. We need to ensure that services meet the needs of the whole population with local adjustments. Could there be vaccinations provided in different settings: community centres, sites of religious gatherings or youth clubs, perhaps?</p> <p>Vaccination saves between <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/immunizations-save-2-3-million-lives-each-year-says-who/1643924.html#:~:text=GENEVA%20%E2%80%94%20The%20World%20Health%20Organization,more%20lives%20can%20be%20saved.\">2 million and 3 million children’s lives</a> each year globally, but we cannot rest on our laurels. The public need reminding of the seriousness of diseases, and of the safety and efficacy of vaccines – and that until a disease is eradicated globally, we must keep vaccinating.</p> <ul> <li><p>Prof Helen Bedford is professor of children’s health at UCL.

People tend to be quite open about their mental health.” This attitude has been encouraged by campaigns run by the students’ union to de-stigmatise issues around mental wellbeing.

Heche, who has died aged 53 after a car crash, came to tabloid prominence in the late 1990s as the girlfriend of Ellen DeGeneres, who was then the star of a hit TV comedy series.</p> <p>Heche later blamed the publicity around their relationship for hampering her career, saying Hollywood was not ready for a lesbian star in straight love-interest roles. That was exactly what her first starring role was; in Six Days, Seven Nights (1998), marooned on a desert island with Harrison Ford. After a string of roles the previous year, including in Volcano and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and critical success in films such as Donnie Brasco and Wag the Dog, Heche had been cast in the film not long before her relationship with DeGeneres was made public.</p> <p>They split up in 2000, and a year later, after marrying Coleman Laffoon, a cameraman who worked on DeGeneres’ standup tour, Heche published a memoir, Call Me Crazy, in which she detailed being abused by her father from infancy through to the age of 12. She said the abuse had left her “insane for 31 years”.</p> <p>Anne was born in Aurora, Ohio, the youngest of five children born to Donald Heche, a choir director in fundamentalist churches, and his wife, Nancy (nee Prickett), whom Anne described as “eerily compliant”. The first-born child, Cynthia, died in infancy. The family moved 11 times during Anne’s childhood, often living on the charity of church members. Aged 12, Anne began working in a supper theatre in Ocean City, New Jersey; she was for a while the family’s main breadwinner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"accac84edf09ee9dc64ce6185718cb21d9aeceb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/accac84edf09ee9dc64ce6185718cb21d9aeceb7/0_0_1823_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Heche with Tommy Lee Jones in Volcano, 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Heche with Tommy Lee Jones in Volcano, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When she was 13, her father died of Aids; Heche believed his hidden homosexuality was part of his life as a sexual predator. Three months after Donald’s death, Heche’s brother, Nathan, died when he crashed his car into a tree. Though his death was ruled an accident, Heche thought that Nathan had taken his own life, unable to bear his father’s legacy.</p> <p>Nancy Heche moved the family to Chicago, where she became a Christian therapist and motivational speaker, advocating “overcoming” the sin of homosexuality. Anne studied at the progressive Francis Parker school in Chicago, and at 16 was spotted by an agent in a school play. After an audition, she was offered a part in the long-running daytime soap opera As the World Turns; but she turned it down as her mother insisted that she finish school first.</p> <p>Shortly before her graduation Heche was offered a dual role in the soap Another World. Her mother again said no, but Heche, by now 18, left for New York, later writing: “I did my time with my mom in a one-bedroom, skanky apartment and I was done.”</p> <p>For the remainder of her adult life she would be estranged from her mother and her elder sister Susan, who died in 2006 of brain cancer. Heche reconciled with her remaining sister, Abigail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d57564006c6408bb4586a76928a31ed5131221e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d57564006c6408bb4586a76928a31ed5131221e3/0_0_2860_1870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Heche in a scene from Donnie Brasco, 1997.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Heche in a scene from Donnie Brasco, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandalay/Baltimore/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heche’s playing of Vicky Hudson and Marley Love in Another World won her a daytime Emmy award in 1991; she moved on to guest roles in TV shows and TV movies. Her first feature film was The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993) and in 1995 she played Joan Chen’s lover in the straight-to-video Wild Side, whose writer-director Donald Cammell took his own life shortly after he saw the release version edited by the producers. Heche got good reviews for a co-starring part in the indy film Walking and Talking (1996), with Catherine Keener, and, in 1997, playing Johnny Depp’s wife in Donnie Brasco.</p> <p>In the same year as Six Days, Seven Nights, she starred with Vince Vaughn in Return to Paradise and took the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/05/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Janet Leigh</a> role of Marion Crane in Gus Van Sant’s shot-by-shot remake of Hitchcock’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian/0,,36035,00.html\" title=\"\">Psycho</a>, with Vaughn as Norman Bates, who kills her in the shower.

In 2002 she starred in David Auburn’s Pulitzer-winning play Proof, as the daughter of a mathematical genius who fears she has inherited both her father’s talent and his mental instability. But despite her fine notices, when the play was filmed in 2005 the lead went to Gwyneth Paltrow.</p> <p>In 2004 she was nominated for a Tony award opposite Alec Baldwin in a revival of Twentieth Century, nominated for an Emmy for the TV movie Gracie’s Choice, and won a Saturn award as best actress in the sci-fi TV movie The Dead Will Tell.</p> <p>She remained busy, playing leads in TV movies and parts in theatrical films that garnered good notices, notably as one of two sisters, both ex-wives of a cop (Woody Harrelson) in the otherwise disappointing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/23/rampart-review\" title=\"\">Rampart</a> (2011), written by James Ellroy, a foil to Colin Firth and Emily Blunt in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/12/arthur-newman-review\" title=\"\">Arthur Newman</a> (2012), starring alongside Sandra Oh in the underrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/12/catfight-review-punchy-satire-american-status-fixation\" title=\"\">Catfight</a> (2016), which follows an on-going rivalry between two college classmates, and excellent in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/31/my-friend-dahmer-review-jeffrey-dahmer-marc-myers-john-backderf\" title=\"\">My Friend Dahmer</a> (2017), as the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer’s mother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06d3c6fdf1c826149c4123ba6dac02a8ac6977ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06d3c6fdf1c826149c4123ba6dac02a8ac6977ef/0_343_1786_1071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Heche with Ellen DeGeneres in 1999; the couple parted the following year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Heche with Ellen DeGeneres in 1999; the couple parted the following year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Whitby-Boot/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime she starred in a string of TV series. In Men in Trees (2006-08) she was a New York City relationship coach who winds up in Elmo, Alaska. A mix of familiar tropes, it was notable because Heche began a relationship with her co-star James Tupper; their son, Atlas, was born in 2009, the same year her divorce from Laffoon was finalised. She and Tupper separated in 2018.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/feb/25/hung-channel-4-hbo\" title=\"\">Hung</a> (2009-11), Heche played the ex-wife of a downtrodden basketball coach who becomes a gigolo. Save Me (2013) lasted seven episodes; she was a woman whose near-death experience turns her into a pipeline from God. In 2016 she starred in Aftermath, as part of a family fighting for post-apocalyptic survival, and in 2017 was deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in The Brave, in which she and her control team manipulate agents in the field.</p> <p>Her most recent film, Wildfire, is due for release later this year, based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3OnSQc48s\" title=\"\">the hit song by Michael Martin Murphey</a>, as the mother of the girl who, in the song, is lost searching in the snow for her pony.

She’s a natural here, playing off the curious informal grandeur the festival brings to this space each summer.

Alsop didn’t overplay the music’s grotesqueries but instead concentrated on its rhythmic drive – something that also infused Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No 3, in which the soloist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/23/facing-the-music-benjamin-grosvenor-pianist\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/23/facing-the-music-benjamin-grosvenor-pianist\">Benjamin Grosvenor</a> assertively led the orchestra through the music’s carefree swagger. Or at least he seemed to: in reality this is a piece that demands tight teamwork if the pianist is going to sound like a star, and that’s what it got here, with Alsop maintaining a tick-tocking momentum throughout. Grosvenor’s encore, Ravel’s Jeux d’eau, was quite a contrast, but its liquid textures were underpinned by the same forensic precision of touch.</p> <p>The timing seemed right for the UK premiere of <a href=\"https://www.hannaheisendle.com/\" title=\"https://www.hannaheisendle.com\">Hannah Eisendle</a>’s Heliosis – the name is the medical term for sunstroke. But this eight-minute piece, written by the Viennese composer last year, doesn’t depict the kind of heat-fug hanging over the parched grass of Hyde Park; it’s more a Death Valley heat, with faint high-frequency sounds from the strings and itchy percussion conjuring images of skittering lizards culminating, Stravinsky-like, in a thudding dance. It’s musically rooted in one spot, but highly evocative.</p> <p>The orchestra’s centre of gravity moved lower for Dvořák’s Symphony No 7, making for a velvety sound that was sometimes hard for the wind soloists to penetrate. Again, the rhythms were lively, the corners neatly turned, but here Alsop’s momentum felt a little relentless. It was just right, though, for the two encores: first Gerhard E Winkler’s Pussy-r-Polka, which sounded like Johann Strauss dancing across an eight-lane freeway, and then Strauss’s Thunder and Lightning Polka, a deftly served slice of real Viennoiserie.</p> <ul> <li><p>Available on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0019sft\">BBC Sounds</a> until 13 August 2023.

By then, Anna and her girlfriend had split up. “I was still thinking about Ben and begged one of his friends to set us up,” she remembers, laughing. He was reluctant at first because of Anna’s previous relationship with his friend, whose birthday brunch it had been. However, he says: “She was fine with it, so I decided to go and see her.”</p> <p>They met in San Francisco a few weeks later and spent the day walking around the city visiting craft markets, before sharing some tacos. “It was a super sweet date,” says Ben. “She was really cute.

Things became more serious and the couple moved into a shared house in 1996, before holding a special ceremony the following year. “We made up our wedding, which is what gay people did back then as same-sex marriage wasn’t actually legal,” she says.</p> <p>In 2001, their first child was born, followed by twins in 2002. “Rather than going to a sperm bank, we decided to ask a trusted friend, Tex, to be a donor,” says Anna. The family moved into a house in Oakland with Tex in 2004. “He has a separate flat but we’re all really close. He is an uncle to the kids,” she says. Later that year, Ben and Anna attempted to formalise their relationship, after the mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, now governor of California, announced plans to legalise same-sex marriage in the city. “We queued for hours but our paperwork was rejected two months later.” Within a month of the announcement, 4,000 same-sex couples tied the knot in San Francisco but then the California Supreme Court ruled all the marriages invalid. “[Mayor Newsom] didn’t actually have the power to make that change,” says Anna.</p> <p>Two years later, Ben told Anna that he no longer identified as a gay woman, but as a transgender man. “The process was more of an evolution than a line drawn in the sand,” he says. “My gender presentation had not changed, but I made the decision to have hormones and surgery so that my body could match that. My transition isn’t a binary one, but it’s a shift in how I feel and how I’m seen in the world.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/08/how-we-met-i-was-a-paper-boy-and-she-was-the-saturday-girl-in-the-newsagents-she-seemed-so-cool\">How we met: ‘I was a paper boy and she was the Saturday girl in the newsagents – she seemed so cool!’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Anna, this wasn’t a surprise. “I was waiting for it to happen.

I wanted him to feel comfortable.” In 2014, they were finally able to marry legally, surrounded by friends and family. “We also have a wedding celebration every year, on the anniversary of the one that was disallowed,” says Anna.</p> <p>After nearly 30 years together, she still appreciates the way her partner keeps her grounded. “I have ADHD, so my brain can be everywhere. He is very fair and always honest. He doesn’t always do the easy thing but he does the right thing. He’s a great artist and an amazing parent.”</p> <p>Ben appreciates Anna’s creativity. “She knows what’s in her heart and she is never afraid to share,” he says. “She always shows up, and I love how she sees the world differently to me.

The man who had begun the night floodlit out on the field, collecting the final few shares he didn’t already own from the founder of the club, certainly did. Or so it goes. Almería had returned to <em>primera </em>for the first time since 2015, faced Real Madrid in their opening game, and proprietor and president Turki Al-Sheikh, the minister in charge of entertainment at the Saudi royal court, didn’t have much faith. Not in his footballers, at least. “I fear we’ll be beaten by a big score,” he said. “I ask the players to draw. If we win, it will be thanks to God.”</p> \n<p>Which is one way to describe Largie Ramazani. Because now, five days later, Al-Sheikh was sitting alongside Florentino Pérez in a plush sofa a little out of place in a football stadium and watching the impossible happen below, like some act of divine intervention. Ramazani had scored and was flying through the air upside down, Almería were actually winning and the place was going wild, the scaffolding from the temporary stands rumbling under feet, the woman behind the goal hammering away at the cymbal she had brought, drumsticks crashing into copper.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a64bc7af2f3b33873a56a8f254d79b055662298\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a64bc7af2f3b33873a56a8f254d79b055662298/0_0_4000_2662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Largie Ramazani celebrates in acrobatic fashion after scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Largie Ramazani celebrates in acrobatic fashion after scoring.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After seven years away from the first division, it took less than seven minutes for Almería to score there, earlier than anyone had done against Madrid in 15 years. Íñigo Eguaras’ glorious pass, first time with the outside of his boot, tspun into Ramazani, racing through with, a single thought in his mind: “Do. Not. Miss.” When his shot hit the net, the former Manchester United youth player leapt into a spectacular somersault, the fans chanting “Yes, we can!”, and if not many truly thought they could, not then, 53 more minutes had gone and Almería were still leading.</p> \n<p>There had been a reaction to resist, goalkeeper and DIY enthusiast Fernando Martínez making three hugely impressive saves and Madrid racking up 12 corners and 17 shots in the first half, seeing a goal disallowed for offside too – but the storm had abated a little. And Almería were still winning, a cup tie energy about it all. A team with four unknown teenagers for summer signings, their best player about to leave and six still not registered, blocked by that salary limit – whose starting XI contained only three men who had played in Spain’s top flight before, and two of those had three games between them – were only beating the European champions.</p> \n<p><em>Were</em>. Just after an hour, Lucas Vázquez got Madrid’s equaliser and then 14 minutes after that, substitute Luka Modric, who changed the match the moment he walked into it, got a free-kick on the edge of the area that really did. On the touchline, David Alaba was preparing to come on and seeing the position, Davide Ancelotti decided to bring the change forward a bit. “We have Alaba here,” he told his dad; “Take the free-kick”, he told Alaba. The Austrian went straight on and, with his first touch, curled an absurd shot into the corner to win it 2-1. “The second is a <em>golazo</em>,” Almería coach Rubi said. “You have to congratulate him. All you can do is applaud. I leave here sad, because we were close to being able to get something. We have taken the best team in the world to the edge.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1558952859437109249\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">HIGHLIGHTS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlmeriaRealMadrid?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AlmeriaRealMadrid</a> 1-2<br><br>🤍 Goals from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lucasvazquez91?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Lucasvazquez91</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Alaba?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@David_Alaba</a> see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realmadriden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realmadriden</a> come from behind in Almería!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaLigaSantander?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LaLigaSantander</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KickOffLaLigaSantander?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#KickOffLaLigaSantander</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaLigaHighlights?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LaLigaHighlights</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/KE5myDl6Rp\">pic.twitter.com/KE5myDl6Rp</a></p>— LaLiga English (@LaLigaEN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1558952859437109249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 14, 2022</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It was significant enough that Almería met them at all, though that alone will not satisfy. This is a club without a big top-flight history, various versions existing before a full start-up in 1971 as Agrupacion Deportiva Almería, which then disappeared in 1982. Re-founded in its current guise in 1989 and beginning in the local leagues, they reached the first division for the first time in 2007, as UD Almería and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/04/europeanfootball.sport1\">with Unai Emery as coach</a>. A relegation and a promotion followed before they went down again in 2015 and almost dropped into Spain’s theoretically amateur, regionalised, third-to-seventh tier from where teams tend not to come back – they were 18th in 2016, 15th in 2017 and 18th in 2018. The following year, they were bought out by Al-Sheikh for €20m.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/12/barcelona-race-against-time-amid-desperate-grasp-at-short-term-levers\">Barcelona’s race against time amid desperate grasp at short-term levers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Al-Sheikh is a renaissance man of many talents who has written some of the greatest musical successes in the Arab world, and counts among the five most important poets there are. That’s what his general director Mohammed el-Assy claimed in <a href=\"https://elpais.com/deportes/2019/09/22/actualidad/1569163673_648144.html\">an extraordinary interview</a> with El Pais, anyway. “In two or three years’ time he wants people to say: ‘Oh, that man from Saudi Arabia is very intelligent. He came here, started with nothing and made everything valuable. He’s not an idiot who comes to waste money,” El-Assy insisted. The former minister of sport, chairman of entertainment authority, advisor to the crown and president of the Arabic football federation, he has a fortune of €2,100m. While he insists that he is not a state but an individual buyer trying to build up a small club, La Liga has doubts, blocking potential sponsorship deals it considered questionable. Still, some estimates put the amount invested in the club at €65m.</p> \n<p>It’s not exactly orthodox. They <em>still</em> don’t have mugs in the club shop, but he did raffle off Audis at games to encourage fans to turn up, paid for coaches like Emery and Quique Setién to come and chat football with him, and got videos from Charlie Sheen, Snoop Dogg, Diego Maradona and Dennis Rodman. How, he didn’t say, but then it was more about the photos, the noise made. He invested in players – Arvin Appiah came from Nottingham Forest, Darwin Núñez arrived, later leaving for €24m, and then so did Umar Sadiq, whose goalscoring numbers were even better. Of the current squad only three were there before him: Iván Martos, César de la Hoz and Martínez.</p> \n<p>He also went through managers, and fast. There were five of them in under two years – Pedro Emanuel, Guti, Mario Silva, José Gomes – but while there’s a certain volatility and unpredictability still, Rubi has now been in the job since the spring of the 2020-21 season, when he led them into the playoffs. The following season, a goal in the last minute of the last game took the title off Eibar – somehow defeated at already relegated Alcorcón – and sent Almería up as champions instead. And so here they were on Sunday night, back in <em>primera</em>. A club with the resources to get there – far more so than others in <em>segunda</em> – and in theory to stay there.</p> \n<p>Not that it was ideal. The stadium’s new name was inaugurated with a concert led by David Bisbal, only for a fire to damage the pitch, meaning their first game there had had to be moved and pre-season hasn’t really been the way they wanted it. What comes next is unclear too, with the club over their salary limit – in part at least because of the cost of promotion. Season-ticket numbers are good – over 10,000 – but far from huge in the first division.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfec6e5e9a1d535db1f164aa8445cf3b86cd12ac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfec6e5e9a1d535db1f164aa8445cf3b86cd12ac/0_0_2173_1562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Almería’s Arnau Solà in action with Eden Hazard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Almería’s Arnau Solà in action with Eden Hazard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Nazca/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sadiq, scorer of 38 goals and 19 assists over the last two league seasons, is about to go. “It’s a purely economic question,” Rubi admitted, resigned to itnot least because it’s been known for weeks: Sadiq’s rental agreement long-since finished, so he’s now living in the same hotel that Real Madrid stayed in this weekend. The transfer fee, expected to be around €30m with Villarreal, Sevilla and Premier League clubs among the suitors, should resolve those financial problems and get them through the FFP threshold; his replacement, Leo Baptistão, doesn’t look that likely to resolve the footballing problems. Ramazani too was expected to go – although he insisted he wants to stay on Sunday. This is a club “in construction”, in Rubi’s euphemistic words, the return to <em>primera</em> met with excitement and gratitude but uncertainty too. Even their owner didn’t think they could win.</p> \n<p>And yet 20 minutes in, there were <em>ol</em><em>és</em> as Almería kept the ball, Rubi not about to back away from his footballing principles entirely, even against Madrid. At times, they pushed Ancelotti’s side all the way back into their six-yard box, Ramazani insisting: “We wanted to show we weren’t scared of them.” Kaiky, 18 and a €7m signing from Santos, was superb. Alongside him, Ely was steady. Ramazani was everywhere. And even after Madrid came back to lead it still wasn’t over: Almería had two great chances at the death, for Ely and Curro, that could have levelled it. So much for beaten by a big score.</p> \n<p>Above all there was an idea, an identity, something to build from: the test now is repeating those qualities when the spotlight is off. “We still have a long way to go but this is a team that will make the fans happy: they will identify with us,” Rubi said. On the first night, they had. It was after 1am, the place almost deserted, the noise gone, when Martínez met a small group of supporters still waiting by the fence, applauding him as he approached, a first division debutant at 32. It had been a good night really, a return. Almería had just made one mistake, he judged: they had scored too soon and even the almighty can’t hold on forever.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ed3f2ea0-6268-4cc4-90ea-9c8c651a1452\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Almería 1-2 Real Madrid, Valencia 1-0 Girona, Cádiz 0-1 Real Sociedad, Barcelona 0-0 Rayo Vallecano, Valladolid 0-3 Villarreal, Celta Vigo 2-2 Espanyol, Osasuna 2-1 Sevilla.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Sid is now taking a well-earned break.

We’re waiting until what? We have an energy crisis right now and we need good leadership. We need alert leadership, leadership that is thinking about this – and that is missing.”</p> <p>Johnson, who has vowed to take no major decisions in his remaining time in office, attended a meeting of energy companies last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/11/boris-johnson-energy-firms-bills-profits-windfall-taxes\">had no conclusive outcome</a>, and is now on his second holiday since resigning last month.</p> <p>King told the Guardian: “He is the prime minster. He wanted to stay on, so he must deliver as prime minister. There is no one else who can do that.”</p> <p>He called for higher taxes on energy companies, which he said were riding soaring energy prices since the Ukraine invasion for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/oil-and-gas-companies-are-looking-at-a-bonanza-from-the-ukraine-war\">bonanza</a>, rather than investing or becoming more efficient. “They are taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/02/big-oil-profits-energy-bills-windfall-tax#:~:text=The%20profits%20bonanza%20in%20the,%249.8bn%20for%20France%27s%20Total.\">bigger and bigger profits</a>, as the prices are so high. That can only mean that they are tying their profits to the price, not the volume they are delivering,” he said.</p> <p>King – a former government chief scientist and UK climate envoy from 2000 to 2007, and as the government’s special representative on climate from 2013 to 2017 he was an adviser to prime ministers and foreign secretaries including Johnson – said valuable time had been wasted while the government failed to act.</p> <p>Waiting several more weeks for a new Conservative leader to take the reins of government would only add to the problem, he said. “There will be extreme suffering, at the lower-paid end of our society,” King warned. “We need fiscal policies that help people in the lower-paid bracket, that manage the costs of energy.”</p> <p>He said home insulation must also be a priority. “Insulating homes is a massive benefit to individuals and the country at large. Home insulation programmes have always been on the back burner for government for such a long time, though the benefits are enormous.”</p> <p>Even starting now would help people across the country with bills, he said, adding: “It’s never too late – if you start now, we could see good progress before winter.”</p> <p>Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will announce new proposals on Monday for how to deal with the UK’s home insulation problem, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/13/keir-starmer-demands-ban-on-raising-energy-prices\">calling for the energy bill cap to be retained at its current £1.971</a>, according to a report in the Observer on Sunday.</p> <p>King was scathing of the Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/09/liz-truss-stands-firm-on-tax-cuts-over-support-for-energy-bills\">emphasis on tax cuts to tackle with the cost of living crisis</a>, though she has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/10/liz-truss-refuses-to-rule-out-help-with-energy-bills-in-apparent-u-turn-rishi-sunak\">also hinted further support could not be ruled out</a>. Rishi Sunak, the other leadership hopeful, proposed to cut VAT on energy bills and offer support to bill payers. “The big beneficiaries of low tax are people who can already afford higher energy prices,” he said.</p> <p>King also criticised the government for turning to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/dont-let-high-energy-prices-derail-uk-green-agenda-say-climate-experts\">increased production of oil and gas in the North Sea</a> to lower energy bills, a move he said would do nothing to alleviate high gas prices and would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/15/new-north-sea-oil-gas-licences-incompatible-uk-climate-goals\">lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades</a>.</p> <p>“It’s completely the wrong timescale – it will take 10 or 20 years for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/north-sea-oil-exploration-should-not-proceed-but-can-says-uks-climate-committee\">new oil and gas projects</a> [started now] to come online,” he warned.</p> <p>The Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an international coalition of scientists chaired by King, will <a href=\"https://www.ccag.earth/\">publish a report this week</a> arguing that governments do not need to return to fossil fuels in response to rising gas prices and energy shortages.</p> <p>International cooperation, expanding investment in renewable energy as well as pursuing energy efficiency through home insulation and in industries would be enough to limit the energy crisis, the report says. Interest rate rises should also be avoided as that would risk a damaging recession.</p> <p>“The remaining global carbon budget of around 400 gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> simply does not allow new fossil fuel expansion,” the report says. “A fossil-fuel rush is simply an unsustainable position and is a big mistake.”</p> <p>Critics sometimes argue that renewable energy is variable and intermittent – but King says overhauling energy grids and diversifying clean sources of power would solve this problem.</p> <p>“Offshore wind is very reliable, as the wind blows a very large percentage of the time from the North Sea,” he added. Hydropower in some areas could be used to store energy in dams for release when wind was low.</p> <p>Nuclear energy also has a part to play, in the UK and around the world, according to King. He said Germany should return to nuclear power, instead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/08/germany-reactivate-coal-power-plants-russia-curbs-gas-flow\">reviving its coal-fired power stations</a>.</p> <p>“I worry about the fact that the fossil fuel lobby has been amazingly powerful,” in the UK and other countries, King said.

It simply would not play out that way.</p> <p>But regardless of her elite status, the US had a duty to fight for Griner and her freedom, and failed woefully to meet that duty. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trevor-reed-says-white-house-not-enough-bring-brittney-griner-paul-whe-rcna39960\">Trevor Reed</a> – a former US marine who himself was recently freed from a Russian prison after the government negotiated a prisoner exchange on his behalf – said it best: “In my opinion, the White House has the ability to get them out extremely fast, and they clearly have chosen not to do that. So no, in my opinion, they’re not doing enough.”</p> <p>And while it’s clear that the US government didn’t fight nearly hard enough for her in those crucial early days, the ways that America failed Griner go well beyond the fact that she’s staring down nearly a decade behind bars.</p> <p>The first of those failures involves why she was in Russia to begin with. The WNBA champion was entering the country to play with the Russian Premier League, as she’s done during every offseason for the last several years. But it’s not just for fun. WNBA salaries are abysmally low, and there are only 14 players in the entire league who earn $200,000 or more. Griner is one of them, clocking in at an average of $221,515 a year in her latest contract. Comparatively, peers like Kevin Durant and LeBron James averaged $48,554,830 and $42,827,766 respectively. This disparity means that female players – even the most seasoned and talented like Griner – are often forced to play in foreign leagues during their WNBA downtime in order to supplement their income.</p> <p>Basketball aside, though, it’s impossible to ignore the tragic irony that surrounds Griner’s situation. She is stuck in a diplomatic quagmire between two countries that hate each other, but also hate everything she is; Black, queer and female.</p> <p>As her agent Lindsay Colas said in a Thursday release following news of her sentence, “Today’s sentencing of Brittney Griner was severe by Russian legal standards and goes to prove what we have known all along, that Brittney is being used as a political pawn.”</p> <p>Colas’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/podcasts/the-daily/brittney-griner-arrest-russia-us-ukraine.html\">qualification</a> of Griner as a political pawn is right on the money, but it would be remiss not to point out who<em> </em>Griner is, and why she made such an easy target. Griner is a gay Black woman caught between two countries that each have their own deep, longstanding cultures of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53055857\">anti-Blackness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/12/12/no-support/russias-gay-propaganda-law-imperils-lgbt-youth\">hostility</a> toward LGBTQ+ people.</p> <p>And while it’s left to be seen whether or not she will spend the next near decade in Russian jail, all hope isn’t lost. Former UN ambassador Bill Richardson, who has been working alongside Griner’s team, says he is <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-prisoner-swap-griner-whelan-russia-ambassador/story?id=88039193\">optimistic</a> about a potential prisoner exchange that would free Griner.</p> <p>Still, no matter how this goes, the damage will already have been done. Griner will have already languished in detention for months, an event that she will no doubt need time to heal and recover from. And when we look back on what happened when a Black, queer woman who is one of the country’s most important sports figures was unjustly imprisoned abroad, this will always be America’s legacy.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/15/arizona-abortion-laws-ban-access","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T10:15:35Z","webTitle":"Abortion is still legal in Arizona.

This comes straight out of the anti-abortion playbook and unfortunately it’s been successful in sowing chaos, confusion and fear among providers and patients in the state,” said Brittany Fonteno, president of Planned Parenthood Arizona, which used to provide about 5,000 abortions annually.</p> <p>Abortion in most circumstances remains legal until 20 weeks of gestation. Yet within hours of the supreme court decision overturning Roe, some Republican officials falsely claimed that a total ban was back in place. The confusion has forced many clinics to suspend or reduce the services they can provide patients.</p> <p>Dr Deshawn Taylor runs the independent Desert Star family planning clinic in Phoenix and has provided abortion care for more than 21 years. For her, it was a tough decision to suspend services but being a Black doctor made her feel particularly vulnerable.</p> <p>“We know that Black people are the first to be criminalised in this country … I’m a Black woman, all my staff are Black and many of our patients are people of color. Abortion is still legal but that would not stop someone from causing a legal disaster that I would not be able to recover from,” Taylor told the Guardian.</p> <p>Taylor restarted abortion care in mid-July, but is offering a muchreduced service – in large part due to staff concerns fueled by misinformation and uncertainty surrounding the legal situation. (One person left, another cannot be convinced that they won’t face criminal charges, and it has been impossible to recruit new staff.)</p> <p>The clinic now offers only medical abortions, whereas previously Taylor provided 90 to 100 surgical abortions a month to patients who needed a later termination and those who simply preferred the surgical procedure because it’s faster, more reliable and less painful.</p> <p>“It’s extremely frustrating that I can’t help my patients to the full extent because of the confusion and misinformation … I’m absolutely sure that more women are being forced to continue pregnancies,” said Taylor.</p> <p>***<br>The post-Roe landscape in the US can be loosely divided into three categories: states that have implemented total (or near-total) bans, abortion-friendly states struggling to keep up with the increased demand, and states – like Arizona – where the confusing legal situation has reduced access to abortions.</p> <p>In Arizona, three laws are being wrangled over:</p> <ul> <li><p>A so-called personhood law</p></li> <li><p>A ban after 15 weeks due to take effect in late September</p></li> <li><p>A 19th-century law banning all abortions</p></li> </ul> <p>In 2021,<a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/04/27/arizona-anti-abortion-bill-becomes-law/4855859001/\"> a two-part anti-abortion bill </a>was signed into law by Governor Doug Ducey which gave fetuses rights from the moment of conception – a so-called personhood law – and made it a crime for doctors to provide abortions for foetal abnormalities. </p> <p>At the time, Roe made the personhood law unconstitutional by default, while a court blocked the foetal abnormality exclusion. Doctors now face prison time if they terminate pregnancies solely on the basis of non-fatal conditions like cystic fibrosis or Down’s syndrome.</p> <p>When Roe fell, advocates quickly filed a lawsuit to block the personhood law, and won after a federal judge last month ruled that the law is too vague and risks arbitrary enforcement. In court filings, the state attorney general, Mark <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2022/07/11/judge-issues-injunction-arizona-anti-abortion-personhood-law/10034656002/\">Brnovich, admitted that it was “anyone’s guess”</a> how the law applies. The injunction has not yet been appealed.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Governor Ducey signed another law that<a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/30/gov-ducey-signs-bill-outlawing-abortions-after-15-weeks-arizona/7223681001/\"> bans almost all abortions after 15 weeks</a> except in extreme medical cases – similar to the Mississippi law that led to the supreme court’s Dobbs ruling.</p> <p>The 15-week legislation will come into force around 24 September – unless a court rules that a law <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/03603.htm\">dating back to 1864 banning all abortions</a> unless deemed medically necessary to save a woman’s life is in fact still valid. The pre-statehood legislation has been condemned as “draconian” by advocates and carries a mandatory two- to five-year prison sentence for anyone who helps or provides a termination.</p> <p> Republicans disagree over which law takes precedence, with Ducey arguing for the recent 15-week law, while Brnovich has claimed that the total ban is in effect. Brnovich has also asked the court to lift the post-Roe injunction on the ban “in order to provide further clarity and uniformity”, according to Brittni Thomason, spokesperson for the AG’s office.</p> <p>Thomason points out that the pre-statehood law was re-codified by the legislature in 1977, and recent legislation explicitly states that the law remains valid and not repealed. “While there will always be people who try to shoot the messenger, Brnovich’s fidelity to the rule of law is beyond reproach.”</p> <p>It’s confusing, but there’s more: <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-arizona\">legislation chipping away at abortion access</a> has been passed by the Republican-controlled legislature and governor every year bar one since 2009. (Before that Democrats controlled the governorship for 12 years and vetoed several bills.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4876d159cfae0722ebe5dbd32b8202fcf62ba00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4876d159cfae0722ebe5dbd32b8202fcf62ba00/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graffiti sprayed at Wesley Bolin Plaza can be seen after multiple nights of abortion-rights protests at the Arizona capitol in Phoenix in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti sprayed at Wesley Bolin Plaza can be seen after multiple nights of abortion-rights protests at the Arizona capitol in Phoenix in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross D Franklin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Advocates argue that this slew of restrictive laws is in fact evidence that the legislature has for years implicitly recognised abortion as a legal regulated medical procedure.</p> <p>“Arizona is the textbook example of chaos and uncertainty, with providers and patients trying to figure out the law. It’s a mess. The attorney general has refused to provide clarity, and you have to conclude that’s because abortion opponents want providers to be conservative in the way they offer care to avoid legal risks,” said Elizabeth Nash, state policy expert at the Guttmacher Institute.</p> <p>A hearing next Friday will help decide the future of abortion access in the Grand Canyon state. It remains to be seen whether the court will rule to validate a total ban first enacted before Arizona became a state, but what’s clear is that further restrictions to access are inevitable. For now, the best-case scenario is that abortion access is reduced from 20 to 15 weeks of gestation.</p> <p>“The 1864 law the attorney general is trying to enforce is cruel, draconian and completely out of step with what the vast majority of Arizonans want. We hope the judge will give us some clarity,” said Fonteno from Planned Parenthood, who will argue against the total ban being resurrected.</p> <p><a href=\"https://kjzz.org/content/1783135/poll-most-arizona-voters-want-abortion-remain-legal\">Almost 90% of Arizonans </a>want abortion to remain legal, at least in some circumstances.</p> <p>In any case, abortion will almost certainly end up in the state supreme court, which the outgoing governor has packed with a conservative majority.</p> <p>One thing that everyone agrees is that there is a lot hanging on the November midterms and 2023 legislative session in Arizona – and across the country. The Trump-backed Republican candidate for<a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/10/arizona-attorney-general-candidates-share-their-stances-abortion/7706590001/\"> attorney general, Abe Hamadeh</a>, has said the total ban is the state law, while the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/kris-mayes-arizona-attorney-general-voting-2022-election\">Democrat candidate, Kris Mayes, </a>has said she considers all three laws under dispute to be unconstitutional and will not enforce them.</p> <p>The Guttmacher Institute expects more states to ban and restrict abortion access next year, with some Republican-controlled legislatures likely to implement overlapping restrictions in an effort to make access impossible inside and outside the state. “It’s a very scary time, and people’s lives and futures do hang in the balance,” said Nash.</p> <p>Dr Taylor said: “My biggest fear is that after all the righteous indignation, people don’t show up to vote in November and we become the next Texas.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/15/weather-tracker-drought-declared-in-england-after-driest-july-since-1935","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T10:08:27Z","webTitle":"Weather tracker: drought declared in England after driest July since 1935","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/15/weather-tracker-drought-declared-in-england-after-driest-july-since-1935","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/15/weather-tracker-drought-declared-in-england-after-driest-july-since-1935","fields":{"headline":"Weather tracker: drought declared in England after driest July since 1935","trailText":"Long-term forecasts indicate dry conditions will prevail across south and east through autumn","byline":"Matt Andrews for MetDesk","body":"<p>Exceptionally hot and dry conditions have continued to plague parts of western Europe, including the UK.

According to the European Drought Observatory, 47% of the EU is under drought warning conditions, based on data from the end of July, with 15% in severe water deficiency. In France, many towns are short of drinking water, and water levels on the Rhine in Germany are so low that essential shipping has been severely disrupted.

Divided into four chapters, Massimo D’Anolfi and Martina Parenti’s sprawling documentary throws the supposed neutrality of the camera up in the air, probing how photography is more than a witness; it can also be an integral cog in the war machine.</p> <p>Restored by film archivists from the ravages of time, flickering, scratchy footage of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Turkish_War\">the Italian-Turkish war of 1911-12</a> jumpstarts this cinematic odyssey; it also alights at the Crisis Unit of the Italian ministry of foreign affairs and <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tablissement_de_communication_et_de_production_audiovisuelle_de_la_D%C3%A9fense\">ECPAD</a>, the audiovisual wing of the French ministry of defence. From a 1911 public hanging of Turkish men in Trieste to the current unrest in Syria, the horrors of war are front and centre, yet organisations such as the Crisis Unit or ECPAD are where images get dissected with critical distance. Training classes at ECPAD, for example, involve analysing photographs for their informational value, instilling in the soldiers the importance of creating audiovisual materials with military interests in mind.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgYy_KZo52A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OgYy_KZo52A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In covering such a wide range of topics, however, the film seems to lose sight of what it is trying to accomplish towards the end. The fourth chapter returns to the refrigerated vaults of film archives, stressing the value of preservation work. Yet this section also includes various clips of wartime brutality with no context. Since the previous chapters go to great length to establish the ideology that lies behind the production of such images, this careless insertion of footage tends to defeat the film’s own purpose. In focusing on how audiovisual materials are scrutinised elsewhere, War and Peace neglects to interrogate its own relationship to the images of war.</p> <p>• War and Peace is available on 18 August on True Story.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/15/fried-breadcrumbed-aubergine-recipe-rachel-roddy","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T10:00:35Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for fried breadcrumbed aubergine | A kitchen in Rome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/15/fried-breadcrumbed-aubergine-recipe-rachel-roddy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/15/fried-breadcrumbed-aubergine-recipe-rachel-roddy","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for fried breadcrumbed aubergine","trailText":"Fried, breadcrumbed aubergine rounds just made for summer dipping into minty cucumber yoghurt","byline":"Rachel Roddy","body":"<p>I once heard a story about a woman who lost her wedding ring while dipping fish in batter – and how her son then ate it. Not only did this story stick in my young head, it raised questions. What sort of ring was it, and how big? Why didn’t she feel it fall off, or notice the lump? Did the son notice as he swallowed? Did he choke? What happened the next day? (I had a good idea about what happened the next day because this story met with another about a piece of Lego.) Four decades on, and this story still bursts up like a sprinkler on a timer every time I dip anything in anything, even without a ring.</p> <p>I also have mixed feelings about the triple dip, which sounds as much like a gymnastic move as it does a cooking instruction. While I enjoy the preparation, setting out the three plates of flour, egg and breadcrumbs, and the sequence of moves to coat evenly, the process inevitably annoys me. Because, regardless of how organised I set out to be, mess invariably creeps in for a hostile takeover: egg in the crumbs, lumps in the egg and spills everywhere. </p> <p>Another problem is that fingers also get a triple coating. Do you rub it off, or rinse them under the tap? Or carry on with thick fingers, in which case dipping can feel a bit like fastening buttons wearing woollen gloves. By the last round of aubergine, which is invariably patchy because there isn’t enough of one of the dips, I usually feel cross. This passes, though, with clearing up, wiping any leftover flour, egg and crumb mess from the work surface and on to a plate, then shaping it into what we call a cow-pat patty, to be fried along with the aubergines.</p> <p>When it comes to frying, I find a medium-sized, 7½cm-deep frying pan works best, positioned at the back of the stove, and in it about 5cm of oil – sunflower, peanut, vegetable or olive. Breadcrumbed aubergine of the thickness I like needs about five minutes, and a relatively low frying temperature of about 160C, which means the slices don’t darken too deeply before they are cooked through and creamy in the middle. You can test the temperature with a thermometer or a cube of bread: you want it to bob around in a coat of bubbles (as opposed to a violent boil) and turn golden steadily.</p> <p>It’s a wonder how aubergine changes, how its bouncy, sponge-like texture cooks and collapses into an almost velvet consistency, which is seasoned by the salt in the flour, coated by the egg and contained by the rough breadcrumb crust. Greek yoghurt mixed with a grated (and squeezed) cucumber, minced mint and a pinch of salt makes a good companion and cool contrast to breadcrumbed aubergine. Tomato and finely chopped onion salad is also great. Or you could make, or buy, a smooth tomato sauce or green sauce and serve with that. If anyone does eat the ring, the cowpat patty is the prize.</p> <h2>Breadcrumbed aubergine</h2> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>15 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>2 aubergines<br>100g plain flour<br>Salt and black pepper<br>3 eggs<br>200g fine breadcrumbs<br>2 tbsp grated parmesan</strong></p> <p>Cut the aubergine into rounds. Their pear shape will mean some are bigger than others – this isn’t a problem, but try to keep them all about 1½cm thick.</p> <p>Put the flour on a plate and season it with salt and pepper. Beat the eggs, then put these in a bowl. Finally, put the breadcrumbs on a third plate and mix them with the parmesan. Have a fourth empty plate ready.</p> <p>Dip both sides of each aubergine round first into the flour, then the egg, then the crumbs, making sure they are well covered, including at the edges, then put on the empty plate. Mix any leftover flour egg and crumbs together and form a flat patty.</p> <p>I find a deep, medium-sized frying pan best. Heat 5cm of oil until it reaches a low temperature for frying– about 160C. You can test this with a thermometer or when a cube of bread fries steadily in it, bobbing around a little, as opposed to a violent boil.</p> <p>Working in batches, fry the aubergines, turning, until golden. Once ready, lift on to a plate lined with kitchen towel to blot briefly, then serve immediately.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/15/cdc-living-with-covid-should-be-countered-by-containing-virus","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T10:00:35Z","webTitle":"‘Living with Covid’ should be countered by containing the virus once and for all | Eric Topol","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/cdc-living-with-covid-should-be-countered-by-containing-virus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/cdc-living-with-covid-should-be-countered-by-containing-virus","fields":{"headline":"‘Living with Covid’ should be countered by containing the virus once and for all","trailText":"CDC’s position should be countered by exploiting the science and our clear capabilities of fully containing the virus","byline":"Eric Topol","body":"<p>Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7133e1.htm?s_cid=mm7133e1_w\">new guidelines</a> for the Covid pandemic, heralding “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/08/11/cdc-coronavirus-recommendations/\">a new strategy [that] pivots from wide approach to a focus on the most vulnerable”</a>. Coincident with the opening of schools across the country, relaxation of some restrictions, such as quarantining and physical distancing, will help keep children in school, a cardinal objective. Sadly, the CDC missed an opportunity to help protect seniors and highly vulnerable Americans.</p> <p>Back in late December 2021, with the onslaught of the Omicron BA 1 wave, the CDC came up with a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html\">five-day isolation policy</a> without any evidence that it would prevent the spread of infections to others, and without advocating the need for rapid antigen testing. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that most people are still infectious after five days, with even rigorous assessment that shows the virus <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202092?query=featured_home\">that can be cultured</a> from some people with Omicron infections at two weeks. Ending isolation by arbitrarily picking a short time duration, with or without symptoms, and advocating masking, has undoubtedly promoted the spread of infections. By steadfastly continuing to endorse this flawed CDC guidance, our public health agency has failed its namesake mission of controlling and preventing Covid disease.</p> <p>For over a year, we have had strong evidence that the primary Covid vaccine series, consisting of two mRNA shots, does not provide adequate protection because of waning immunity. Yet the CDC refuses to change its definition that “<em>fully vaccinated</em>” is two shots. This not only ignores a large body of data but gives the impression to many that a booster is unnecessary, which helps explain why the United States booster rate is pathetically low, at 32% of the population, in stark contrast to most other 37 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) peer countries with rates that exceed 65%. The United States ranks below over 70 countries including Panama, Rwanda, Tajikistan, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan and Iran. That’s just the data for one booster, the third shot.</p> <p>As we progressed through the Omicron wave and its subvariants, the need for a second booster became highly substantiated for people aged 50 and older. Five different studies, with varying age groups from 50 to 80 plus, have shown markedly enhanced protection with less mortality for the people who had four shots (two boosters) compared with three shots. But the rate of <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total\">a second booster in Americans age 50-64 years is only 11% and for age 65 and older it is 26%</a>. If the CDC was truly interested in protecting the vulnerable, it would be engaged in aggressive efforts to get the lifesaving potential of a fourth shot out to the public, and revise what “fully vaccinated” actually means as substantiated by ample data. All of this is consistent with the CDC’s unwillingness to stand strong on the imperative of boosters, not fully endorsing them for adults until the end of November 2021.</p> <p>With the revised guidelines, the CDC continue to push a contrived metric which they call “community level” to “know your risk for serious illness”. As defined by <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=CommunityLevels&amp;null=CommunityLevels\">the CDC website</a>, this “is determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days”.<strong> </strong>This is not appropriate guidance since Americans would be rightfully concerned about getting infected, not stressing hospital resources in their community. The right United States map, is the “<a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=CommunityLevels&amp;null=Risk\">community transmission</a>” which simply reflects the number of confirmed cases in the past seven days per region. That map currently shows that 94% of the country’s population is at high-risk of transmitting Covid whereas the community level map is only 39.7%.</p> <p>It is a deceptive way for CDC to present a rose-colored-glasses semblance of lower risk. That, too, is unnecessarily promoting spread of Covid to others, especially including the vulnerable, that it purports to want to protect. No less, this is further exacerbating the toll of long Covid, a condition that millions of Americans are suffering from, due to the virus’s massive, unbridled spread throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>When it comes to protecting more than 7 million Americans who are significantly immunocompromised, we have Evusheld monoclonal antibodies, for which the two shots given intramuscularly <em>prevents</em> Covid for up to six months. <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20220801/evusheld-for-covid-lifesaving-and-free-but-still-few-takers\">The United States purchased 1.7m doses, but by the end of July fewer than 400,000 people had received this protection</a>. That is less than 6% of our immunocompromised population–the highest level of vulnerability – who have been left unprotected.</p> <p>All of this is occurring while the United States is still in the midst of its BA.5 wave, the variant with the most immune escape and transmissibility we have yet seen, now with well over 100,000 new <em>confirmed</em> cases per day (the actual number is unknown, but far higher), over 40,000 people hospitalized, and more than 500 deaths per day. While we have reached a plateau in hospitalizations, there are no strong signs of descent in these metrics, <a href=\"https://biobot.io/data/\">except for some lowering of the high wastewater Sars-CoV-2 levels</a>, such that the duration of this wave is uncertain. It is hoped that we will be through the BA.5 wave by the end of August, as judged by the time it has taken for many countries in Europe, that preceded us, for it to pass.</p> <p>Where does that take us in the months ahead? In the United States there is only one other variant with appreciable growth, called BA.4.6, with a genomic sequence that reassembles BA.5, but has been shown to have the potential to escape protection from Evusheld. While accounting for about 5% of new cases here right now, and in Australia, it may well continue to show growth advantage, and there should be some protection conferred from the large number of people who have had BA.5 infections.</p> <p>Theoretically, the BA.5 specific vaccine booster that may become available later this fall, might provide better protection against BA.4.6 infections than the original vaccine, but that remains to be proven. The imminent rise of this variant, however, could extend the current wave. More worrisome is the prospect for a whole new variant family like Omicron to emerge in the months ahead that has not yet shown up on the genomic surveillance radar but could pose more of a challenge to our vaccine and infection-induced immunity.</p> <p>That is why now is the time to gear up and stop the “leak” of current vaccines – the minimal protection or duration against current variants, despite still good protection against severe disease. That can only be accomplished via building mucosal immunity, which is why Professor Iwasaki and I have called for <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.add9947\">Operation Nasal Vaccine</a>. We also need to press on with a universal, variant-proof coronavirus vaccine which would get ahead of potential pathogenic mutations of the virus rather than chasing specific variants, the untenable strategy as the virus continues to adapt faster than our response.</p> <p>Anticipating resistance to Paxlovid, for which we have been heavily relying upon in high-risk individuals, is necessary given the recent findings of multiple, naturally occurring mutations in the virus that could impair its efficacy in the future. That requires accelerating the testing of backup pills or their combinations that stop replication of the virus. All these measures do not connote any sense of relaxation against Covid. The CDC position that we need to “live with Covid”, as espoused with its guidance, should be countered by exploiting the science and our clear capabilities of fully containing the virus, once and for all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Eric Topol is the founder and director of the <a href=\"https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/\">Scripps Research Translational Institute</a>, professor of molecular medicine and executive vice-president of Scripps Research</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/15/first-thing-iran-says-salman-rushdie-and-supporters-to-blame-for-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T09:57:23Z","webTitle":"Iran says Salman Rushdie and supporters to blame for attack | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/first-thing-iran-says-salman-rushdie-and-supporters-to-blame-for-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/first-thing-iran-says-salman-rushdie-and-supporters-to-blame-for-attack","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Iran says Salman Rushdie and supporters to blame for attack","trailText":"Foreign ministry spokesperson says freedom of speech does not justify insults upon religion.

The album was an adaptation of their shows, which were sequenced to tell a story – “how five different women reached their ‘Strike’ moment”, as de Wit puts it. Forty years after it faded into obscurity, it is being reissued as part of a retrospective on the late Josefowitz’s artistic career, and its resolute calls for bodily autonomy and queer liberation are as pertinent as ever.</p> <p>Swiss-raised Josefowitz and Holland-born de Wit formed the musical core of the group, covering guitar, clarinet, drums, bells and more besides, while all members practised breath, voice and singing work. “[They] brought all that 70s European women’s confidence that I had never encountered before,” Bushe remembers of Josefowitz and de Wit. Radical outlooks and European influences found their way on to the album too, including covers of a French nursery rhyme and a track by 70s German women’s co-op rock band Flying Lesbians. There’s also an anti-war song attributed to Greenham Common women’s peace camp, a protest established in the early 80s that would play a key role in the movement for nuclear disarmament as well as women’s participation in UK activism. Of the track selection, says Halse, “the choice was always to be inclusive, supportive and broad, within our rather limited skill range.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7c021550036587cc173a950a0e050c2381542ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7c021550036587cc173a950a0e050c2381542ab/72_250_2229_1337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘The personal is political’ … (L-R) Marja Ruyterman, Cathy Frost, Mara deWit and Lea van Muijen in 1982.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The personal is political’ … (L-R) Marja Ruyterman, Cathy Frost, Mara deWit and Lea van Muijen in 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And Lining Time were more than just a band. Halse describes them as a “consciousness-raising” group collaborating artistically and to question beliefs and assumptions: “This is still an ongoing conversation. The personal is political.” Community-minded, they would take a cappella songs and rhythmic clapping and stomping from the project into the community, engaging groups such as travellers, visually impaired people and pregnant women through performance. “This lively singing was received well. [It was] infectious, instantly connecting to women’s and girls’ experiences,” says de Wit. “It was very dynamic and fun.”</p> <p>Lining Time dissolved after that year in Plymouth. Moving to Wales, Josefowitz and de Wit continued to perform as Research and Navigation from 1983-88, to audiences such as care home residents. Beyond that, Josefowitz continued her career in <a href=\"https://www.cathyjosefowitz.ch/eng\">the dramatic and visual arts</a>, creating choreographic works and paintings exploring the body, self-expression and dance. Her works included cardboard marionettes of performing artists, skewed architectural sketches of stages, paintings of bodies contorted by motion and emotion and, towards the end of her life, a series of colourist abstractions eschewing bodies entirely.

Here are the main proposals:</p> <h2>Boris Johnson’s government</h2> <p>With its pledge to not make any major policy or fiscal decisions, Downing Street is limited in what it can do, while Johnson himself has been largely absent for the summer. Last week, the prime minister did join a meeting with energy firm bosses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/aug/11/us-federal-reserve-inflation-interest-rates-ftse-100-gdp-house-prices-business-live?page=with:block-62f4f1dc8f083b8f443ff30e#block-62f4f1dc8f083b8f443ff30e\">after which Johnson said</a> he would be “urging” the electricity sector to keep bills low.</p> <h2>Liz Truss</h2> <p>The Conservative leadership frontrunner has focused her attention on tax cuts, pledging to reverse the recent increase in national insurance. The only specific help on energy bills she has proposed is to suspend green levies, which would save the average household about £150 a year. Truss has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/10/liz-truss-refuses-to-rule-out-help-with-energy-bills-in-apparent-u-turn-rishi-sunak\">not ruled out further help</a>, but has repeatedly stressed her preference for tax cuts, although these would disproportionately help higher earners, and do nothing for pensioners or those not in work.</p> <h2>Rishi Sunak</h2> <p>The former chancellor has in part pledged to stand by assistance he announced while still in government, and said last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/12/sunak-pledges-10bn-to-help-vulnerable-with-soaring-energy-bills\">he would cut VAT on energy bills</a>, at a cost of about £5bn a year, pledging a similar sum again on targeted help for poorer households.</p> <h2>Labour</h2> <p>Under a plan formally announced late on Sunday, the party would spend £29bn with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax\">six-month scheme that would freeze energy prices at the current cap</a>, before it goes up in October. This would assist all households, even richer ones, but Keir Starmer has argued it would bring certainty and help to curb inflation, thus helping people with other bills. It would be paid for in part by an expanded windfall tax on energy producers.</p> <h2>Liberal Democrats</h2> <p>In a similar scheme – one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/08/ed-davey-calls-for-energy-furlough-scheme-to-avoid-october-price-cap-rise\">announced a week earlier</a> – the party called for what the party’s leader, Sir Ed Davey, called an “energy furlough scheme”, that would freeze bills and also be financed in part by a wider windfall tax.</p> <p>An updated version of the plan called for what the party called a “double freeze” on cost of living issues – stopping energy price rises and an inflation-based increase in rail fares, which is due to come into force in January.</p> <h2>Greens</h2> <p>The party is expected to formally announce its proposals later this week. They are expected to call for energy prices to be not just frozen but reduced to the level of last October, before the price cap rise in April. The other element will be a proposal to permanently nationalise the main energy supply firms, allowing a low price cap and assisting with longer-term green energy efforts.</p> <h2>Gordon Brown</h2> <p>Announced last week in the absence of a formal Labour proposal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/10/tax-profits-freeze-energy-prices-bring-suppliers-into-public-sector-gordon-brown\">the ex-PM’s plan, outlined in the Guardian</a>, would mean a halt in any further rises in the price cap, negotiations on prices with individual companies over bill levels, and the possibility of temporary nationalisation for energy supply firms who could not keep bills down, modelled on what happened to some banks after the 2009 financial crash.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/japanese-nurseries-takeaway-dirty-nappy-rule-perplexes-parents","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T09:00:54Z","webTitle":"Japanese nurseries’ take-home dirty nappy rule perplexes parents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/japanese-nurseries-takeaway-dirty-nappy-rule-perplexes-parents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/japanese-nurseries-takeaway-dirty-nappy-rule-perplexes-parents","fields":{"headline":"Japanese nurseries’ take-home dirty nappy rule perplexes parents","trailText":"Survey reveals common practice is seen as ‘strange’ by parents handed child’s soiled nappies to take home","byline":"Justin McCurry in Tokyo","body":"<p>Waiting lists for Japanese nurseries are finally falling, but many parents have found that securing one of the coveted places comes at a price – taking home their child’s soiled nappies.</p> <p>A survey has shone a light on the common but rarely discussed practice, with about 40% of towns and cities in Japan saying they demand the guardians of their infant clientele take their used nappies with them.</p> <p>“I’ve never told the day care that it bothers me because I don’t want to rock the boat. But it’s strange,” said one mother, who returns from picking up her child with three or four filled nappies in a bag that she throws away as soon as she gets home.</p> <p>“Why should I take them home?” added the woman, whose two-year-old daughter attends a day care centre in Kyoto, where the city government has had the policy in place since 2011, according to the <a href=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20220813/p2a/00m/0na/018000c\">Mainichi Shimbun newspaper</a>.</p> <p>Baby Job – an Osaka-based child support company that supplies nappies to public childcare providers – surveyed all 1,461 municipalities that run day care centres and found 39% operated a “takeaway” policy.</p> <p>The firm placed towns and cities on the list even if just one of the centres they operate make parents return home each day with used nappies.</p> <p>The poll found 49% had no such requirement, while 11% were unsure or simply responded “other”.</p> <p>The chief “offender” was Shiga prefecture in western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a>, where 89% of nursery facilities asked parents to take their child’s nappies home, compared with 17% in Tokyo and 5% in the southern prefecture of Okinawa.</p> <p>The facilities gave several reasons for making the demand, with most saying it gave parents the opportunity to check their child’s health by examining their stools, while a smaller number said they did not have the facilities or budget to dispose of the nappies themselves.</p> <p>An official in the south-western city of Fukuoka said the practice was a hangover from the days when reusable nappies were more common. “We want the children’s guardians to keep track of their health condition, such as the number of times they poo,” Yukinori Abe, of the municipal government’s children’s future bureau, told Mainichi Shimbun.</p> <p>“Guardians buy crayons and other items that are used by individual children at the centre … the same goes for diapers, with guardians bearing the cost of their disposal.”</p> <p>Yuiko Fujita, a sociology professor at Meiji University, said the policy reflected Japanese society’s outdated approach to childcare.</p> <p>“It is allowed to continue because our society has little awareness of raising children together,” she said. “The idea that it’s the mother’s responsibility to take care of children and their excrement is deeply rooted.”</p> <p>While the number of births in Japan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/elon-musk-tweet-sparks-debate-in-japan-on-falling-birthrate\">fell to a record low</a> of 810,000 last year, anger among working mothers over the lack of childcare facilities has prompted local governments to dramatically increase places at publicly run day care centres.</p> <p>The number of children waiting for preschool slots in Tokyo has fallen to about 300, compared with more than 8,500 five years ago, while 80% of towns and cities no longer have a waiting list, according to the welfare ministry.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/15/left-age-right-labour-youthful-idealism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T09:00:35Z","webTitle":"I’ve drifted left with age, not right.

Faced with our current political reality, it’s the only option we have, says author Lynsey Hanley","byline":"Lynsey Hanley","body":"<p>I became a socialist at the age of 41, just at the point where conventional wisdom says I should have been heading in the opposite direction. In truth, I always was a socialist at heart, but my generation – born in the social ferment of the 1970s, raised amid the deranged individualism of the 1980s, coming of age in the era of Blair and Brown – grew up believing that socialism was a dirty word, not to be embraced or admitted aloud.</p> <p>If, like me, you’re in your late 40s and came of age declaiming that Things Can Only Get Better, look around you now. Everything I learned about “global warming” as a primary school child in the mid-1980s is coming true as we speak. Fuel hikes set by conglomerates are going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/energy-bills-great-britain-winter-discount\">treble the bills</a> of every household in the country. Your children are less protected in every sense from the predations of landlords, profiteers and exploitative bosses. If they go to university, they will probably be in tens of thousands of pounds of debt for a higher education you didn’t have to pay for.</p> <p>In 2017, my fatalism disappeared – as if overnight – when Labour published its general election manifesto, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/16/labour-manifesto-analysis-key-points-pledges\">For the Many Not the Few</a>. There were no signs whatsoever of an unhappy accommodation with the idea that there was “no alternative” to the free market. It presented, clearly and confidently, exactly what the alternatives were. I wouldn’t even describe the manifesto as an expression of socialism; more rigorous social democracy of the kind that worked economic miracles in capitalist countries throughout the postwar period. Public ownership of essential services; good wages for good jobs; decent, affordable housing for everyone.</p> <p>That June I voted, enthusiastically, for Labour’s vision of social democracy. A week later, following the horror of 72 avoidable deaths at Grenfell Tower, I knew I was a socialist. I hadn’t changed my mind overnight: a confident, growing movement for change had captured my imagination and articulated what I’d always known to be true. Grenfell represented the nadir of 40 years’ complacency, both from Conservative governments and the Labour governments so many people of my generation campaigned for in our 20s.</p> <p>What can now be seen as complacency looked like compromise back then. New Labour so successfully neutralised opposition to their mashup of neoliberal economics and social liberalism that most Labour voters either put up or shut up or simply stopped voting. When Labour came to power in 1997 and restricted child benefit and income top-ups for single parents, I batted it away on the grounds that “it has to be done”, and that anyone who complained was either “middle class” (cringe) or deluded as to the scale of Labour’s task in holding power.</p> <p>When the language of “rights and responsibilities”, so popular in the 1990s and 2000s as a cover for demonising people living on council estates, became ever coarser and more rabid, I shifted awkwardly in my seat and mumbled that it went down well in precisely those council estates. (This had a lot to do with having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/29/children-housing-estate-chelmsley-wood-birmingham\">grown up on one</a> where the received wisdom was hang ‘em, flog ‘em, and vote for Maggie.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c118bc1c4eb3c35224cdafbf2bb1c387a0aa8a47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c118bc1c4eb3c35224cdafbf2bb1c387a0aa8a47/0_75_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Keir Starmer is making Labour the party of “not-Tories” rather than a movement that stands confidently for its founding values of equity and justice.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Labour held power over 13 years, I gradually saw most opportunities for transformative change rot away. In that time, I became incredibly disillusioned, but still voted for them. There were several reasons for this. First, like young adults now who have grown up under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson, if you were born in the late 1970s, you came of age only knowing a cruel, divisive and seemingly unending Tory government. Whatever Labour did, it had to be better than the Tories, simply because Labour was not the Tories.</p> <p>Second, we grew up at the nerve-shredding tail end of the cold war. For most of the 1980s the end of the world through nuclear exchange seemed inevitable. The fall of the Berlin Wall came as such a relief that, naturally, we wanted to believe that it really was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/21/bring-back-ideology-fukuyama-end-history-25-years-on\">the end of history</a>”. We’d had quite enough of history, thank you: it nearly killed us all.</p> <p>Many people of my age wanted to be done with politics, with believing in things: it seemed too earnest by half. The fact was, if a Labour government entered power promising to keep things pretty much as they were, while creating a load of money and spreading it around a bit better, who were we to complain?</p> <p>And yet, to some, there were still reds under the bed, and they needed to be vanquished at all costs. As a student in 1994, my best friend –then at Manchester University and, like me, a member of Labour Students – reported with approval that he’d received a Christmas card from someone high up in the campaign to get Tony Blair elected. Instead of “Season’s Greetings”, the message inside read: “Keep kicking the Tories and the hard left”.</p> <p>In the 1980s, as now, it was very easy to hate the Tories and “the Trots” without particularly articulating what it was you were <em>for. </em>Defining your outlook by what you were <em>against </em>was so much easier. We didn’t stop too long to ask what sort of a Labour government we were after, only that one was necessary and largely involved more attacking than defending.</p> <p>I’ve thought about this a lot in recent weeks, as Keir Starmer dedicates himself to making Labour the party of “not-Tories” rather than a movement that stands confidently for its founding values of equity and justice. It was the incredible surge of enthusiasm and optimism during the Jeremy Corbyn period that made me recognise, with a shudder of shame, that it was people around my age who could have done things differently. What right does Starmer have to throw away that enthusiasm, to crush that optimism, and say, “let’s keep things as they are, only this time there’ll be no money to spread around a bit more fairly”? It won’t be long before he finds out that not only is he wrong, but he’s done it all for nothing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706889\">In a 2020 article</a> published in The Journal of Politics, American researchers tested the truism that most people drift towards conservatism as they get older. Although they found that “political attitudes are remarkably stable over the long term … liberals are more likely to become conservatives than conservatives are to become liberals.” The researchers refer coyly to the role of “folk wisdom” in bringing this about, perhaps better described as the triumph of experience over hope. But experience has taught me that hope is far too important to dismiss as youthful idealism. It’s no longer the case that anyone over the age of 40 who isn’t a conservative doesn’t have a brain; surely, it’s anyone who isn’t a socialist.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As unemployment benefits ended, vaccines rolled out, and reopenings expanded, employers and commercial real estate groups have been pushing to try to get workers back into offices.</p> <p>But the pandemic further exposed the issues in returning to office, from long commutes to and from work, exorbitant childcare costs, ongoing concerns over exposure to Covid-19 variants and now monkeypox, workers are pushing to keep working from home as an option as employers force a return to the office.</p> <p>At AT&amp;T, the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/att/#:~:text=AT%26T%20is%20the%20world's%20largest,company%20of%20WarnerMedia%20in%202018.\">world’s largest telecommunication company</a>, workers represented by the Communications Workers of America agreed to a work from home extension until the end of March 2023, but workers say the company is forcing many workers to return to the office much sooner than that, while other departments had already been forced back to the office by their managers.</p> <p>James Bloch, an AT&amp;T employee in Cleveland, Ohio, for 21 years, said the work from home option has been beneficial for workers’ mental health, protection from Covid-19, productivity, attendance and carbon footprint.</p> <p>“These are extremely stressful times over the last few years and being at home has allowed us to have less distractions, giving us better one-on-one time with our customers and our clients,” said Bloch. “With AT&amp;T technology, they’re a communication company. We have some of the best stuff out there. Let’s use it. We can do the same job from home anywhere that we could do if we were all sitting there together.”</p> <p>Other workers agree.</p> <p>Sara Fry, an AT&amp;T service representative in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said her department was told they were being brought back to the office as early as 21 September 2022. Fry argued AT&amp;T has not provided workers with adequate explanations and details as to why they are forcing workers to return to the office. She speculated the decision stemmed from exerting control over workers and undermining the union.</p> <p>“All of our production is great. Our attendance numbers have improved since folks have been working from home and this news is just crushing. It’s heartbreaking,” she said. “I don’t think management realizes how deeply hurt and how deeply angry some employees will be about this”</p> <p>AT&amp;T workers have started a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/make-work-from-home-a-permanent-option-for-at-t-employees\">petition</a> demanding the company makes working from home a permanent option for workers.</p> <p>“We don’t understand if we’re still in a pandemic, we’re still considered essential workers and we’re still doing the appropriate job, then why are we coming back to the office?” said Chuck Elgert, communication technician at AT&amp;T and executive vice-president of CWA Local 6350 in St Louis, Missouri. “There’s no reason to risk anybody’s health and safety that’s not 100% necessary to run the operations of the business.”</p> <p>He emphasized workers were also concerned because AT&amp;T has an ageing workforce, particularly in departments where many workers are over the age of 55, and that AT&amp;T has workplace surveillance tools in place so that managers can constantly monitor the work that workers are doing from home and make changes if necessary. </p> <p>Val Williams, an AT&amp;T worker and union steward for the Communications Workers of America in Houston, Texas, was forced to return to work in the office in April 2022. She criticized the push to bring workers back into the office after she said workers had been praised for productivity while working from home.</p> <p>When she returned to work, it was to a new building where not all departments had been brought back, and Williams argued Covid-19 infections have continued to be an issue in the workplace and Covid-19 sick leave is currently inadequate, with five days off.</p> <p>Williams criticized the pushback to return to the office given AT&amp;T is a communications company with the technology and resources to make working from home a seamless option.</p> <p>“Our revenue has increased over the last two years while we were working from home. Our job descriptions state we are capable of working with little to minimum management and that’s what we’ve been doing,” she said.</p> <p>She also argued it was unfair how the push to return workers to the office has been enforced, with some departments being brought back while others are still working from home.</p> <p>“We don’t feel like anybody’s health is greater than any others. Because everybody has their own health issues, or they may have family members that have health issues that they have to return home to,” she added.</p> <p>Charli Haataja, another AT&amp;T worker in Minneapolis, Minnesota, compared returning to the office as enacting a pay cut given the amount of money workers would need to spend on gas, on monthly parking fees, childcare and the extra time it takes to commute.</p> <p>“Working from home has been a gamechanger for employees that most of us have not seen in our lifetimes working in our work careers, to have gained back any kind of work-life balance, or peace of mind in the workplace, to have your circumstances improve, rather than get worse,” Haataja said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for AT&amp;T did not provide data on how many workers at the company are still working from home, but claimed it was never the company’s intention to make working from home indefinite.</p> <p>“The health and safety of our employees continues to be our priority,” said the spokesperson in an email. “As we have throughout the pandemic, we adhere to guidance from the medical community, including implementing safety protocols to help protect our employees’ wellbeing. And now that we are a largely vaccinated workforce, we believe it’s safe for employees to return to the workplace. We do our best work when we’re together.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/15/six-ways-heatproof-garden-provide-shade-make-compost-leave-weeds","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T09:00:34Z","webTitle":"Provide shade, make compost and leave the weeds: six ways to heatproof your garden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/15/six-ways-heatproof-garden-provide-shade-make-compost-leave-weeds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/15/six-ways-heatproof-garden-provide-shade-make-compost-leave-weeds","fields":{"headline":"Provide shade, make compost and leave the weeds: six ways to heatproof your garden","trailText":"Extreme weather isn’t going away – so it’s time to change how you care for your green space. Our gardening expert explains how","byline":"Alys Fowler","body":"<p>Gardens often act as a middle ground between our built-up, manufactured indoor lives and the world outside. The garden, whether it is a few pots, an allotment or something much larger, is a tiny slice of the rest of the ecology of our globe – and it teaches us about the gossamer threads that hold these things together.</p> <p>In the blast of the UK heatwave in July, we watched our gardens curl and crisp. Stalks bent and wilted; leaves scorched and then browned. How much of your green space survived depended on how you had been tending those delicate threads. </p> <p>The next heatwave might last for longer. It might arrive with stronger winds, or leave behind wilder, wetter days. The winter will present its own challenges – more flooding, perhaps, as baked-hard soils struggle to soak up the rain. We need to prepare; this weather isn’t going away. The question is: how? </p> <p>Heatproofing your garden begins before you step foot in it. Our gardens, their inhabitants, our world, is under threat because of rampant fossil-fuel usage and yet some of the biggest polluters are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/02/bank-of-england-under-fire-over-climate-stress-tests\">unwittingly bankrolled by us</a>, through our current accounts, mortgages and savings. Choosing a bank that is committed and transparent about tackling the climate crisis should be high on your to-do list. Tell your old bank why you are leaving; tell them that you are a gardener and it is your job to foster what is left. Then we can begin the good work of making sure our gardens are resilient enough to deal with whatever the weather throws at them.</p> <h2>Considering dry plants? Dig a little deeper</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b7f7e3922f5ed592054d5e8225b4d14a18d76b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b7f7e3922f5ed592054d5e8225b4d14a18d76b9/0_0_8660_5773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman farming on an organic farm\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most of the UK sits on clay, so plants and crops should be chosen with this in mind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: vgajic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is easy to imagine that the simplest move might be to replace the plants that failed with dry garden plants, those Mediterranean types that thrive in baked places with intense suns. But to grow these plants you need free-draining, low-nutrient soils that are made up of grit, gravel, rocks and sand – and the UK is not blessed with these.</p> <p>Most of the UK sits on clay; try to grow dry garden plants on these soils, even with the addition of extra grit and gravel, and you may struggle. The soils that dry garden plants thrive in are lower in nutrients than clay- or humus-rich soils and thus the plants grow more slowly. They do not grow lush or rich; instead, they grow tough, which protects them in the heat. Grow these plants on richer soils and they grow too fast, too leggy and too weak.</p> <p>If the summer doesn’t get them, they will rot in the wet of winter. If you have a gravel pit or are on urban rubble, then by all means these are your plants. But if you are on clay, gleys or heavy chalk marls – anything that becomes sticky and unworkable in winter – then the solution is not to rush out to buy gravel or grit to change your soils, for there is no sustainable extraction of gravel, grit or sand. These materials are heavy to extract, to bag and to transport, and the removal of them radically changes the soils and the environment from which they came.</p> <h2>‘Right plant, right place’ has never been more true</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b996e08a978441630e9f5b1fea32f32fe13189c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b996e08a978441630e9f5b1fea32f32fe13189c/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman cutting dahlia flowers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plants with fat tubers, such as dahlias, might fare better in the heat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Betsie Van der Meer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The things that failed in your garden were most likely on the edge of what they could tolerate, whether that was light or soil conditions, competition from other plants or exposure to wind. Anything that had to compete with major tree roots probably suffered as the tree’s vast root system drew in any surface moisture available to support its bulk.</p> <p>Don’t try to replace like with like. If a plant completely failed, compost it and replace it with something tougher. We have been allowed to believe that we are gods in our gardens. We often plant what we want, not what the garden needs. Now, we have to heed a new religion, honouring soil and the ecosystem.</p> <p>These tough plants have to be drought-tolerant and capable of wet winters. These are not necessarily dry garden plants, although they share their resourcefulness and their thicker or hairier (or both) leaves that don’t frazzle in the heat – things such as verbascums, <em>Stachys </em><em>byzantina</em>, <em>Verbena bonairensis</em> and <em>Verbena hastata</em>, <em>Salvia nemorosa</em> and cultivars, and hylotelephiums (formerly sedums). Plants with storage organs in their roots – such as dahlias, with their fat tubers, or daylilies such as <em>Hemerocallis</em> “Hyperion”, with thick underground rhizomes – might fare well. See also comfrey, mallows, poppies and wild carrots – anything wielding deep taproots.</p> <p>One of the reasons why perennial vegetables tend to fair better than annual vegetables in extreme weather is because they have extensive, mature root systems that allow them to reach down into the soil where more moisture might be hidden, but also draw back resources and wait it out. They might look a little beaten, but with the first rain they will start to bounce back.</p> <h2>Study your garden for answers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02d2cac3ea24895a33c3cbd079c45d8ce2c4111a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02d2cac3ea24895a33c3cbd079c45d8ce2c4111a/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman planting broad beans in a raised bed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diverse planting can protect your crops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Price/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take a good look around your garden and pay attention to what did and didn’t do so well, to see if you can rectify the conditions. Was it drying winds or lack of shade? Could you grow taller plants to offer shade and slow down whipping winds? Sunflowers (not the super-tall ones that nearly always need staking) are a good example: they will offer shade to leafy vegetables and smaller plants and, if grown in drift or clump, rather than a single line, are very good at slowing down winds.</p> <p>How you group plants also matters. A single line of annual vegetables have little to protect them; they are at the mercy of the sun and the wind. In block planting, the central members are fortified by their neighbours. Likewise, I have found that using polycultures instead of monocultures works, because of the diversity of planting. The lettuce out in the sun might bolt, but the one growing tucked under the courgette will be fine. </p> <h2>Leaf cover protects more than soil</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae262e8a4eb40cf28d6daf96c02cdacea5c5f094\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae262e8a4eb40cf28d6daf96c02cdacea5c5f094/0_0_4608_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman standing next to a sunflower patch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunflowers will offer shade to leafy vegetables.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kanchanalak Chanthaphun/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exposed soil is baked soil, devoid of life. Most vegetables like to grow in soils around the 20C to 25C mark (as do many microbes, for that matter). Left to bake in the sun, soil can easily reach a temperature in the high 40s. Mulches can make a huge difference, but leaf cover does an even better job, whether that is specific ground cover plants, such as clovers and trefoils for the vegetable garden, or something as simple as leaving weeds in place before a hot spell.</p> <p>Soil that is protected by leaf cover doesn’t just help the plants, but the wildlife, too: it offers refuges for insects, frogs, small mammals and birds. During the July heatwave, my resident blackbird spent the whole time hopping about under the dense leaf cover of my garden.</p> <p>Mulching in spring and autumn, to protect the soil from summer suns and winter rains, has always been good practice. But temporary or short-lived summer mulches are going to become much more important. Straw mulches, grass clippings, alfalfa meal and comfrey leaves can also be used around plants that have high water requirements and bare soil, such as tomatoes, strawberries, courgettes, pumpkins, aubergine, mangetout and runner beans. Water these plants well, deep into the soil, when it is cooler, then cover with a mulch. Comfrey leaves are particularly useful, as they have the added bonus of feeding the plants as they break down.</p> <h2>Water wisely</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a41fc4e22beeff68ce0218862df54421c4dfe4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a41fc4e22beeff68ce0218862df54421c4dfe4a/0_0_4571_3808/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman watering large sunflowers with a watering can\" width=\"1000\" height=\"833\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water judiciously – and never on your lawn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dougal Waters/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It makes sense to water anything that is still getting established, along with food crops, but do so late in the evening, very early in the morning or, if using a sprinkler, at night. Sprinklers use a huge amount of water, but if you can choose one that allows you to set it to sprinkle low to the ground, rather than up into the sky, you are at least not wasting it. Don’t ever water your lawn; it is wasteful. Grass has evolved to die right back at the surface and reappear again in autumn when the weather is cooler and wetter. You will notice that lawns that are cut longer are much more resilient than those shorn to an inch of their life.</p> <h2>Keep your soil well fed</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb168a2db3317659e3e60fd98fa983c10f27cb0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb168a2db3317659e3e60fd98fa983c10f27cb0d/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman adding to compost heap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The organic matter in compost acts like a sponge in the soil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: coldsnowstorm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The single most significant thing you can do for your garden (after changing your bank) is to compost. It is an old idea – not quite as old as the soil in your garden; that took about 500 years to make – but it works. Organic matter acts like a sponge in the soil, soaking up water and releasing it slowly when it is needed.</p> <p>You do not need to dig it into the soil; just spread it across a few centimetres thick and allow the worms to do the rest. They will efficiently move it down into the soil far better than you could. Their extensive network of tunnels will allow air and water to penetrate into the soil. In turn, this will feed the soil food-web, ignite the soil microbial community and encourage the roots to grow and explore.</p> <p>An extensive and healthy root network is one of the best ways for a plant to become resilient. The better your soil, the better the root, the more they can cope with.</p> <p>Two days of heat was hard; longer spells will be brutal. I stood for mere seconds in the afternoon of the last heatwave and watched the garden shimmer with that strange yellow light, anxious for the leafy things, but all I lost was a few lettuces. After years of composting and spreading it out, of not digging and planting my polyculture densely, the soil is resilient. Yours can be, too.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/15/spotted-lanterfly-killing-new-york","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T09:00:34Z","webTitle":"On the hunt with New York’s spotted lanternfly squishers: ‘I came to kill’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/spotted-lanterfly-killing-new-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/spotted-lanterfly-killing-new-york","fields":{"headline":"On the hunt with New York’s spotted lanternfly squishers: ‘I came to kill’","trailText":"Local officials have instructed residents to destroy the insects – and some New Yorkers are taking it very seriously","byline":"Naaman Zhou in New York","body":"<p>Michael Thomas, a maintenance worker, was inspecting the base of 3 World Trade Center in late June of last year when he started to notice groups of heart-shaped bugs, three or four at a time, “crawling up on the walls” of the thousand-foot skyscraper in lower Manhattan. He went to sweep them up, hoping to keep them from entering through the revolving doors, or flying into the lobby. Then, he said, “they just started to multiply”.</p> <p>What Thomas saw were spotted lanternflies, a visually arresting, fast-spreading invasive species – that New Yorkers are under strict instructions to kill. In the age of overlapping viral outbreaks (Covid, monkeypox, the return, in some places, of polio), this kind of clear government communication is a gift. The New York state department of agriculture is very direct: “If you see a Spotted Lanternfly in New York City, kill it immediately by stepping on it or crushing it.”</p> <p>Some insects have powerful defences. The ironclad beetle has a thick shell, stronger than an entomologist’s pin; bees sting. Not so the spotted lanternfly. It flies slowly, it does not bite, and even when startled, it often only has the energy for one jump. It is as soft as a butterfly, but less friable than a moth.

Nunez, an ex-marine, is an animal lover. At home, he has three rescued sugar gliders (a kind of possum), three rescued ferrets (he has saved seven total), and two turtles.</p> <p>On a bright, clear day, as those around him headed to the amusement park or the beach, Nunez and his three sons – Jayden, Joshua and Jerry, all in the back seat – drove to Coney Island Creek Park, a stretch of urban scrub that Nunez called “one of the heaviest locations” he goes to. Joshua, 13, carried a bright yellow net.</p> <p>In their original habitat in China, spotted lanternfly numbers are kept low by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/09/16/760147903/vineyards-facing-an-insect-invasion-may-turn-to-aliens-for-help\">parasitic wasps</a>. They lay eggs in young lanternflies, which are in turn are eaten from within once the baby wasps hatch. On Coney Island, Nunez uses his hands. “Sometimes I just slap them,” he said. “They’re slow. You literally put your hand 45 degrees? They’ll die.” He estimates that he kills 200 to 400 lanternflies a week.</p> <p>At a particularly infested tree, festooned with fifty to eighty lanternflies, Nunez paused. “A blowtorch would kill them instantly, but you’d damage the tree,” he mused. “Chemicals would kill them instantly, but you damage the tree, damage the soil, damage the environment.”</p> <p>Instead, he sprayed the bugs with a solution of water and vinegar (it supposedly blocks their respiratory openings) and the family resumed stomping. “Stomp ’em out with your Timbs, man!” Joshua said to his older brother, Jayden. “Stomp ’em out, stomp ’em out,” Nunez said, like a mantra. He was slapping tired lanternflies against the bark of the tree. He held one up in his hand, said “this is how I execute,” and pulled off its head. He put the body in a plastic tub to feed to his turtles and pets. (“Sugar gliders need protein, so insects are part of their regimen.”) In the middle of the melee, a bright green leafhopper landed on Nunez. “This is actually what we are not trying to kill,” he said. It sat for a moment on his finger, then flew away.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You know it kills me, because I do really like bugs. And they’re not ugly bugs</p> <footer> <cite>Jonathan Nunez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite his proficiency, Nunez is clear that what he does “is not the answer”. In his spare time, he studies the lanternfly online. He wanted to be an entomologist or a vet, before the military got in the way. “You know, it kills me, because I do really like bugs,” he said. “And they’re not ugly bugs.”</p> <p>The answer, he said, was “ecological stabilization”.

some of the rorts:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What happens is that, all too often, service providers can put in an invoice and no one checks if the service has been done, no one properly scrutinises the price, it is automatically paid sight-unseen.</p> \n   <p>There are 100 people working on the back-office data analytics, but this fraud comes from many forms, from the extreme criminal version and over-servicing, and all the providers are more frustrated than anyone else because it gives service provision a bad name.</p> \n   <p>[The NDIS’s] problems are caused by people who are not disabled, not caused by the conscientious disability service providers and hundreds of thousands of disability care workers. This is [from] some people who have been operating in a wild west, [with a] lack of scrutiny and that has to stop.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-15T08:44:08.159Z\">at 9.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fa01e98f086d0d751f1abf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-15T08:22:37.525Z\">9.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Constitutional law expert says former PM’s secret portfolios ‘just bizarre’</strong></p> \n  <p>Earlier this afternoon, constitutional law expert <strong>Anne Twomey</strong> was on the ABC discussing the former PM’s secret portfolios, and she said it was a “bizarre” situation:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>Oh, well, look, frankly [it’s] just bizarre. The secretness of it is the weird thing. I mean, it’s not strange that [Morrison] might want to have a second person who was able to take over if the first person was incapacitated, etc. But there are ways of doing that anyway. And ordinarily if you do something like that, the basic rules are you announce it to parliament because parliament needs to know who is responsible.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Also, you can just make changes to the administrative arrangement orders, which is the other way of doing this. So that’s a way of saying – OK, in relation to the Biosecurity Act ... the minister for agriculture can seize powers and the minister of health can seize other powers. You can change that by just going to the governor general, having a council meeting and saying, yes, the prime minister can also exercise these powers.</em></p> \n   <p><em>I went through every single administrative arrangement order this morning and it’s just not there. So what an earth is going on? I don’t know, but the secrecy involved in this is just simply bizarre. I mean, you know, you just wonder what is wrong with these people that they have to do everything in secret and they can’t fess up to what they’re doing.

discuss the police’s capability, capacity and structure to respond to domestic violence, as well as cultural issues within the force.</p> \n  <p>It comes after <a

this month</a> that the commission had not asked Carroll to give evidence at the public hearings before they were scheduled to wrap up last week, prompting criticism from victims’ advocates.</p> \n  <p>Over the past five weeks, the inquiry has heard several disturbing allegations about the culture within the force such as officers allegedly referring to domestic violence as “foreplay” and reports police did not investigate a woman’s suspicious death because she and her husband were “a pair of scumbags who live in a shit area”.</p> \n  <p>When contacted by Guardian Australia earlier this month, the commission did not explain why the commissioner was not originally asked to give evidence at the hearings in person.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

So if the same pattern continues, we might expect a new wave from a new subvariant around November. And there’s already a couple on the horizon.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Esterman said the BA.2.75 variant was taking over as the dominant strain in India, while BA.4.6 had begun to take hold in parts of the US.</p> \n  <p>Those strains were almost certainly already in Australia but it was too soon to know whether they would become dominant or whether a subvariant that caused more severe infections would assume their place, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There’s absolutely no guarantee that the next wave that comes along isn’t going to be incredibly severe. We simply don’t know.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>States and territories have largely rolled back protections including mask mandates.</p> \n  <p>But Esterman said the persistence of the virus meant there was a need for more public health measures including greater education about mask-wearing and the importance of booster shots:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>More important than the peaks of the waves is the height of the trough in between them.

Her father was Welsh, her mother, Helen Hay, Scottish, and the younger Helen identified her “native soil” as that of Scotland.</p> <p>Her political views, influenced by the nonconformist minister Andrew Kippis, were radical: she addressed the abolition of slavery in <a href=\"https://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/bhw18-w0150.shtml\">a substantial poem</a> and her support of the French Revolution took her to Paris, where she was briefly imprisoned. Her literary work included fiction and translation, but she was a prolific poet and is now considered one of the precursors of the Romantic movement, often noticing the minor elements of the natural world, as in her Sonnet to the Strawberry: “Thou bid’st the scenes of childhood rise to view, / The wild wood-path which fancy loves to trace; / Where, veil’d in leaves, thy fruit of rosy hue / Lurk’d on its pliant stem with modest grace.”</p> <p>This week’s poem, a response to <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43817/to-a-mountain-daisy\">Robert Burns’s To a Mountain Daisy</a>, takes its governing figure from his poem, seeing the poet as the “mountain daisy” and his more privileged rivals as the garden’s “flaunting flowers” (a direct quotation from the Burns). The daisy, though destroyed by the plough in the original poem, will “never die”, Williams asserts, having been “cherish’d by the ray / A poet drew from heav’n”’. But divine inspiration isn’t the sole source of the achievement. While Williams, who knew Burns, doesn’t minimise his struggles with “adverse fortune”, she might suggest, between the lines, that he has nevertheless been invigorated by the confrontation with “each storm that on the mountain blows”. Might “the shelter of the vale” inhibit genius? Some consciousness of the restrictions a female writer needed to challenge, if her gift wasn’t to be smothered, perhaps underlies the energy of Williams’s evocations of raw, cold experience.</p> <p>Importantly, anger is seen as an enabling force for Burns. The following exuberant lines celebrate indignation as well as passion and originality, and, notably, give Genius a feminine pronoun: “By Genius in her native vigour nurst, / On Nature with impassion’d look he gazed, / Then through the cloud of adverse fortune burst / Indignant, and in light unborrow’d blaz’d.”</p> <p>Exposure to the “bare soil and bitter gale” may be treated ambiguously at times, but Williams demands “SCOTIA!” herself, in the poem’s concluding lines, to shield the poet from “rude sorrow”. Her emotion seems to blaze in response to the despair expressed by Burns in his last stanza: “Ev’n thou who mourn’st the Daisy’s fate, / That fate is thine – no distant date; / Stern Ruin’s ploughshare drives elate, / Full on thy bloom, / Till crush’d beneath the furrow’s weight / Shall be thy doom.”</p> <p>Williams, who died in 1827, had a turbulent career, but one that was long and interesting. During her last years she ran an influential salon in Paris. Her collection, Poems on Various Subjects, was published in 1823.</p> <p><br><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/15/sydney-morning-herald-executive-says-he-was-not-contacted-by-peter-costello-over-nines-crown-coverage","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T08:59:55Z","webTitle":"Nine publisher says he was not contacted by Peter Costello over Nine’s Crown coverage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/sydney-morning-herald-executive-says-he-was-not-contacted-by-peter-costello-over-nines-crown-coverage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/sydney-morning-herald-executive-says-he-was-not-contacted-by-peter-costello-over-nines-crown-coverage","fields":{"headline":"Nine publisher says he was not contacted by Peter Costello over Nine’s Crown coverage","trailText":"James Chessell sends email to staff after both he and the Nine chairman were the subject of an email attack by James Packer","byline":"Anne Davies","body":"<p>The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age’s publisher,James Chessell, has told staff at the Nine newspapers that he was not contacted by the Nine chairman, Peter Costello, in relation to the group’s award-winning coverage of money laundering at Crown casino.</p> <p>“I never heard a word from Peter Costello about Crown Unmasked before, during or after publication/broadcast,” Chessell said in an email to staff on Monday morning, after both he and the Nine chairman were the subject of an email attack by billionaire James Packer.</p> <p>Chessell was responding to reports in the Australian which aired several emails sent from Packer in late July to numerous people in the media and to other media groups.</p> <p>Until recently, Packer was the major shareholder in Crown, which was at the centre of allegations of money laundering and ties with junkets associated with organised crime which were the subject of a series of articles and a 60 Minutes program, Crown Unmasked, by Age investigative reporter Nick McKenzie.

It also aimed to use its resources to enable people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to make the most of their potential, whether at PwC or elsewhere.</p> <p>In 2021, the New World New Skills schools initiative helped around 17,000 young people develop workplace skills. It engaged with schools that had a higher than average proportion of students in receipt of free school meals and those in social mobility cold spots (where it is hardest to escape deprivation). <a href=\"https://www.educationandemployers.org/research/contemporary-transitions-young-britons-reflect-on-life-after-secondary-school-and-college/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research</a> by the charity Education and Employers shows that young people who have four or more encounters with the world of work while at school are 86% more likely to go on to be in education, employment or training post-18, and will go on to earn 18% more (on average) than their peers.</p> <p>Hollie Crompton, PwC’s social mobility lead, says businesses of all sizes can take action on social mobility. “This isn’t just about corporate social responsibility. We do it because it’s good for the economy, it’s good for society and for our future talent pipeline. We want people from diverse backgrounds to want to come and work with us.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"542a67a87f0de75b90e92b8381fc45ed84c00a87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/542a67a87f0de75b90e92b8381fc45ed84c00a87/0_120_2121_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Group Of Young Candidates Sitting At Boardroom Table Listening To Presentation At Business Graduate Recruitment Assessment Day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scheme aims to acquaint students with real-world office settings and tasks, such as giving presentations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: monkeybusinessimages/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crompton herself joined the company via a school leaver initiative in 2004, the equivalent of an apprenticeship scheme. “The fact that I didn’t come through the graduate route has made me passionate about making sure we’ve got different opportunities for different people to join in different ways.”</p> <p>The social mobility strategy covers four areas – recruitment, development and progression, advocacy, and community engagement (where the New World New Skills schools initiative sits). As well as the in-person office visits, schools can access an online employability toolkit of lesson plans and resources, and a series of on-demand skills sessions. There are also opportunities for a paid week of work experience during the summer holidays, ringfenced for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds – 225 year 12 students are due to take part this year.</p> <p>PwC also has an annual volunteering day, One Firm One Day, and this year a number of staff visited schools and ran sessions on financial literacy, data analytics and team building with students. After the Southmoor Academy trip to the Newcastle office, for example, a number of PwC employees took the opportunity to run workshops at the school about financial management, how to read a payslip and what tax means.</p> <p>Since autumn 2021, when in-person activities restarted after the lockdowns, the firm has hosted office visits from more than 70 schools involving 3,000 students, says Crompton, while a further 3,000 students were reached by One Firm One Day activities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/community-of-solvers/2022/jun/30/how-an-online-hub-upskills-job-seekers-it-shows-you-how-you-can-prepare-yourself\">How an online hub upskills job seekers: ‘It shows you how you can prepare yourself’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wareham opened the doors of Southmoor Academy to local businesses four years ago and now engages with almost 200 on initiatives such as work experience and in-school visits. “We felt that exam results were all very well and good, but we realised that students weren’t prepared for the future,” he says. “Although they could say they got a level nine in English, they couldn’t talk about themselves and their skills. [Businesses and schools] have to work together to ensure that our young people can achieve the most that they can.”</p> <p>PwC is also working internally to track the impact socioeconomic background has on careers. It significantly increased the data it holds on the backgrounds of its 24,000 UK staff and is in the process of analysing the results. For the past five years, the firm has ranked in the top 10 in the Social Mobility Foundation’s employer index for its work in this area, and in 2021 PwC <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/pwc-uk-publishes-socio-economic-background-and-disability-pay-gaps-for-the-first-time.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">voluntarily published</a> its socioeconomic background pay gap for the first time.</p> <p>Crompton advises businesses that are similarly keen to make an impact to “learn from what you’ve done around other areas of diversity. A lot of organisations are much further ahead in their thinking about how they tackle diversity issues such as gender and ethnicity. That can be applied to socioeconomic background.”</p> <p>For Wareham, he’s just received news that one of his year 13 students has been accepted on to PwC’s apprenticeship programme. “That’s exactly why we’re doing this. It’s about opening doors and broadening students’ horizons, no matter their background. Everyone should have the same opportunities.”</p> <p><em>Whether you’re just starting out or have a wealth of experience under your belt, find out more about <a href=\"http://pwctrk.co.uk/tp/rj6.t5e0w-J-K\" rel=\"nofollow\">career opportunities at PwC</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"football/2022/aug/15/football-transfer-rumours-moises-caicedo-to-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T08:42:26Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Moisés Caicedo to Manchester United?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/football-transfer-rumours-moises-caicedo-to-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/15/football-transfer-rumours-moises-caicedo-to-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Moisés Caicedo to Manchester United?","trailText":"Aouar to Forest? | Aubameyang to Chelsea? | Messi back to Barça?","byline":"Daniel Harris","body":"<p>Round about a year and a half ago, <strong>Moisés Caicedo</strong> was playing for Independiente del Valle in his native Ecuador, making a name for himself as a skilful and physical all-round midfielder. As such, he was offered to Manchester United, who’ve been in desperate need of that since God was a lad, and Ole Gunnar Solskjær was keen, only for those above him to deem the deal too complicated, demanding, as it did, the payment of money.</p> <p>So Caicedo went to Brighton, whose negotiators somehow navigated the torturous path of handing over the asking price, and has been excellent ever since. He stood out in his new side’s 4-0 thrashing of United last season and also in their opening-day win over them, such that United now want to sign him in what would be yet another triumph for football’s most-fabled recruitment department. However, Arsenal, West Ham, Juventus, Atlético Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen are also monitoring the situation.</p> <p>Nor is he United’s only target – they are also feigning interest in Espanyol’s <strong>Raúl de Tomás</strong>. Expect them to be enthusiastic right until they discover the price is determined, not by the buyer but by the seller.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the astute decision to first buy <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>, then retain him against his will, continues to bear fruit. Ronaldo, it is said, is knocking about Carrington with all his usual grace and humility, so United have offered him to both Milan clubs. Amazingly, neither are keen to disturb their playing system or dressing-room equilibrium for a past-it prima donna, so he remains at Old Trafford – at least until his contract is cancelled, at which point the number of clubs keen on him, currently zero, is expected to increase.</p> <p>But all the discussion of United’s behaviour should not distract us from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/12/barcelona-race-against-time-amid-desperate-grasp-at-short-term-levers\">that of Barcelona</a>. They’d like to rid themselves of <strong>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</strong> – some might say they have no choice but to, given their general indebtedness and the wages they owe Frenkie de Jong – but have rejected a £12m bid from Chelsea. In the meantime, Xavi is acting with all the sensible frugality of a man who spent six years playing and managing in Qatar, mithering Joan Laporta to resign – sorry, to <em>re-sign­ </em>– <strong>Lionel Messi</strong> from Paris Saint-Germain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/jul/06/football-transfer-window-summer-2022-mens-deals-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1-club-guides\">Football transfer window summer 2022 – Europe’s top five men’s leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But all the discussion of Barcelona’s behaviour should not distract us from that of Chelsea, blazing money despite exchanging an owner who is one of the richest men in the world for an owner wanting to cosplay director of football.

Others display the Russian flag, or quotes from Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Over the past five months, Moscow has appointed an occupation administration to run the Kherson region and ordered schools to teach the Russian curriculum. Local people are encouraged to apply for Russian passports to access pensions and other benefits.</p> <p>The next stage of the Kremlin’s plan is a referendum, to add a dubious sense of legality to these facts on the ground, and create a pretext for bringing Kherson and other occupied parts of southern Ukraine into Russia, using an updated version of the 2014 Crimea playbook.</p> <p>In a series of telephone interviews, people in Kherson reported minimal enthusiasm for a referendum, and described a nervous, unpredictable atmosphere in the city.</p> <p>Residents remain unsure about what the next few months might bring: a swift Ukrainian counteroffensive to regain control, a protracted battle that turns the city to rubble, or Russia carrying out its sham referendum and annexing the territory.</p> <p>“You have to remember there was never any talk in Kherson of a referendum; no one thought about it before the war. Now it will be a referendum at gunpoint,” said Kostyantyn, who worked in the IT sector before the occupation.</p> <p>Even those who described themselves as largely apolitical said they were firmly opposed to voting in a referendum or joining Russia.</p> <p>“I will not go to the referendum, of course. I don’t know anyone who will. I am not a political person and don’t have strong opinions on politics but it is clear to me that a referendum is not right,” said Svitlana, a former beauty salon employee who is now selling food items on the street to make ends meet.</p> <p>Russian authorities have used intimidation to crush public opposition to their rule.

The official curfew begins at 10pm, but few people go out after five.</p> <p>The noisy protest rallies have been replaced by an underground partisan movement.

One person with whom the Guardian spoke said he had responded to a Facebook post back in March, seeking people living in occupied areas, and now regularly shares information with a contact from the Ukrainian security services.</p> <p>“I am not involved in any way in any underground organisations. I just pass on the information I see … which factories are working with the occupiers, troop movements, Russian banks I see opening,” he said.</p> <p>The Kremlin reportedly plans to hold the referendum on 11 September. In June, the Russian-language news outlet Meduza <a href=\"https://meduza.io/feature/2022/06/09/kak-utverzhdayut-istochniki-meduzy-kreml-hochet-ob-edinit-okkupirovannye-territorii-ukrainy-v-novyy-federalnyy-okrug-v-sostave-rf\">cited</a> three sources close to the Kremlin detailing a plan to hold referendums in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – and subsequently turn them into one new region of Russia.</p> <p>There is a possibility that Russia will stall, hoping for military victories that bring the four regions under full control. Ukraine still holds major cities in the Donetsk region, such as Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, as well as Zaporizhzhia city.</p> <p>According to some reports, however, ballots are already being printed. In late July, the Russian administration in Kherson invited people to put forward their candidacy as electoral officials.</p> <p>In Zaporizhzhia, the chair of the regional parliament, Olena Zhuk, said she saw “many signs” that the Russians were preparing for a referendum soon in the occupied parts of the region. “Let’s start by saying any referendum would be illegitimate by Ukrainian law, by Russian law, by any law,” she said in a telephone interview.</p> <p>Formally annexing more Ukrainian territory may not have been in the Kremlin’s war plans from the beginning. Putin’s goal appears to have been a lightning march to Kyiv and the installation there of a pro-Russia puppet government, which would have kept Ukraine as a nominally independent state in Russia’s orbit.</p> <p>That plan failed, and the focus moved to annexing larger chunks of southern and eastern Ukraine. In the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the Russians appointed Volodymyr Saldo and Yevhen Balytskiy, former Ukrainian MPs, as the nominal heads of their administrations.</p> <p>Saldo fell ill a month ago, and was reportedly airlifted to Moscow in a coma, amid rumours of poisoning.</p> <p>In Zaporizhzhia, Zhuk said she knew Balytskiy personally and was “shocked” that he had decided to collaborate. She predicted, however, that the Russians would soon have little use for him. “Nobody likes betrayers. It is a rule of life,” she said.</p> <p>“These people are sent to the square in the first few days to say: ‘Russia will help us. We are all brothers’. But then in one or two months, when the people have been pacified a bit, other people will come and take real power.”</p> <p>Lower down the chain, the Russians have struggled to find Ukrainian officials to fill the ranks of their occupation administrations, particularly while the future is so uncertain.</p> <p>“No one wants to work for the Russians. They know it is a one-way ticket to hell,” said Kostyantyn, the former IT worker. Russian television sometimes blurs the faces of officials to ensure they do not become targets for attacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"834f6a40865931464e47114a9f6b18f89f8d4b1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/834f6a40865931464e47114a9f6b18f89f8d4b1e/0_98_3828_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyrylo Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-backed administration in Kherson, in his office\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyrylo Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-backed administration in Kherson, in his office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the most visible figures of Russian rule in Kherson is Kyrylo Stremousov, a former anti-vaccine blogger who stood for mayoral elections in 2020 and received about 1.5% of the vote.</p> <p>While there have been disappearances and reports of torture, the situation in the occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions is different to the full-scale terror that Russian forces unleashed in Bucha and other occupied areas closer to Kyiv back in March. Here, the Russians have tried to launch something of a “hearts and minds” operation in parallel to the intimidation.</p> <p>In one recent meeting in a park in the village of Mykilske, Stremousov told a crowd, most of whom were pensioners, that Russia was here to solve their problems, promising an improved economic situation and also using Kremlin rhetoric about so-called “traditional values” in opposition to the decadent west.</p> <p>“We want to return to the world where there is a real understanding of the word ‘family’ and not a perverted form of it, where everyone can feel like part of one whole,” he said.</p> <p>The Russians want to open schools on 1 September using the Russian curriculum, and have placed adverts seeking teachers from Russia to “retrain” Ukrainian teachers.</p> <p>The new administration has also renamed the Kherson National Technical University, dropping the word “national”, and has promised free tuition for anyone of any age who wants to study.</p> <p>“We are doing everything to make sure we can open our doors on 1 September and our first students can start their lives in comfortable surroundings,” said the Russian-appointed rector, Halyna Raiko, in an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGWbHJlCWac\">interview</a> for a pro-Russian television station in which she appeared visibly nervous and uncomfortable.</p> <p>While nostalgia for the Soviet period and appeals to conservative social values may work on a segment of the older population, many people who remain in Kherson are hoping fervently for Ukraine to regain control over the city.</p> <p>“When we hear explosions, everyone rejoices – it means Ukraine is coming closer,” said Olena, a 45-year-old mother, but she conceded that this prospect also comes with its own set of fears.</p> <p>“We are waiting for the Ukrainian army, but of course we hope civilians don’t die during the liberation. We love our city and don’t want it to be turned into Mariupol,” she said.</p> <p>There is a fear, though, that if the Kremlin succeeds with its referendum plan and formally annexes the territory, a Ukrainian counteroffensive would become harder and more dangerous, and a Russian crackdown would be on the cards.</p> <p>“Everyone knows that Russia will fake the referendum results,” said one person who runs an anti-Russia Telegram channel from inside Kherson, who asked not to use his name. “They will feel even more empowered and start rounding up everyone who voted against.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/japan-ministers-visit-controversial-war-shrine-as-south-korea-calls-for-end-to-historical-tensions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T08:32:09Z","webTitle":"Japan ministers visit war shrine as South Korea calls for end to historical tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/japan-ministers-visit-controversial-war-shrine-as-south-korea-calls-for-end-to-historical-tensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/japan-ministers-visit-controversial-war-shrine-as-south-korea-calls-for-end-to-historical-tensions","fields":{"headline":"Japan ministers visit war shrine as South Korea calls for end to historical tensions","trailText":"Japan PM Fumio Kishida sends offering but stays away from Yasukuni, which honours dead including class-A war criminals","byline":"Justin McCurry in Tokyo and agencies","body":"<p>Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, sent a ritual offering to a controversial war shrine on Monday – the anniversary of Japan’s defeat in the second world war – as one of its wartime victims, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a>, called for an end to historical tensions.</p> <p>Kishida apparently decided to stay away from the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo to avoid antagonising South Korea and China, but three of his ministers have made the pilgrimage in recent days.</p> <p>Yasukuni visits by conservative Japanese politicians have traditionally drawn condemnation from South Korea and China, which view the shrine as a symbol of Japanese militarism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/north-and-south-korea-tensions-relations-issue-conflict-division-explained-in-30-seconds\">North and South Korea relations: what’s behind the tensions – in 30 seconds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shrine honours 2.5 million Japanese soldiers and civilians who died in wars in the 19th and 20th centuries, including 14 men convicted by the allies as class-A war criminals.</p> <p>The public broadcaster NHK showed Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative who was appointed economic security minister last week, visiting Yasukuni on Monday morning.

Managers are being urged to carefully check the backgrounds of such guests, including by trawling through up to five years of posts, according to an article in the Financial Times.</p> <p>The report quoted allies of the Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg as saying the due diligence policy, which took effect this week, was “very sensible” and should be implemented straight away, since “there have been far too many examples recently where essentially extremist speakers have been invited to speak to civil servants and staff networks”.</p> <p>Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, criticised the rules for providing “a draconian excuse to block critics of government policy from even setting foot in Whitehall buildings”. <br><br>She added: “Instead of seeking to silence entirely legitimate criticism of their litany of failures, ministers could do with listening to experts a little more and burying their heads in the sand a little less. By listening they might learn something about addressing the dysfunction that has set in at the heart of this Conservative government.”</p> <p>The Cabinet Office said speakers would not be automatically barred if they had previously posted critical comments of government, and would be considered on a case-by-case basis. It defended the vetting process on impartiality grounds.<br><br>The checks include trawling through between three and five years of posts on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn to search for “potentially problematic or controversial material that may contravene civil service values”, including criticism of government officials or policy, strong political views and “behaviour that might bring the civil service into disrepute”. <br><br>The Cabinet Office said the policy had been “introduced to ensure there is a proper process for inviting speakers to talk to civil servants in the Cabinet Office, as the public rightly expects”.</p> <p>“We take a zero tolerance approach to discriminatory behaviour and this process will help prevent anyone with a history of such comments from being invited,” it

windfall tax, is the radical approach needed to help households and reduce inflation, contrasting it with the inaction of a “lame duck” government.</p> \n<p>In a round of media interviews on Monday morning intended to seize the initiative on the crisis, the Labour leader rejected the idea he had been too slow to propose a solution, given he was on holiday last week.</p> \n<p>Under the proposals, the energy price cap would be frozen at the current level, meaning a planned 80% rise in October, taking the average household bill to about £3,600, would not happen.</p> \n<p>Quizzed on why he was spending close to £30bn on a scheme that also assisted better-off people, Starmer said that while some other targeted measures would remain in place, his was the best overall approach.</p> \n<figure

up, causes that anxiety, and then rebates some people after the event, but doesn’t do anything about inflation, or do we want to be more radical, more bold, more ambitious?” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.</p> \n<p>“One of the benefits of our proposal is that it brings inflation down, which benefits everybody, but particularly those who are most vulnerable, and those who are least well off.</p> \n<p>“So I’m not going to apologise for a scheme which is comprehensive, which is costed, which has the double benefit of eliminating those price rises, and which is an effective measure against inflation.”</p> \n<p>Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies economic thinktank, has queried whether Labour’s plan would help greatly with inflation, saying the rate would go up again once the energy subsidy ended.</p> \n<p>Quizzed about this in another interview, with ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Starmer argued it would nonetheless help with inflation over the winter.</p> \n<p>“What [Johnson] is rightly saying is that what happens after April matters, because you have to maintain measures to reduce inflation,” he said. “Of course, we’d have to do that in April when we see the circumstances.”</p> \n<p>An existing plan to give an extra £650 help for pensioners and those receiving universal credit would remain in place, Starmer said, and the party would also push ahead with changes to pre-payment meters, used by many of the most financially vulnerable households.</p> \n<p>In the longer term, he said, Labour would spend billions of pounds insulating homes so people needed to use less energy.</p> \n<p>Starmer contrasted his plan with the lack of action from Boris Johnson amid competing plans from the two candidates to replace him, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.</p> \n<p>“The Conservative party hasn’t made that choice,” he told Good Morning Britain. “It can’t make that choice. Because all we’ve seen from them is internal squabbling between the leadership hopefuls, who are all arguing about just how awful they have been in government, and a prime minister who is a lame duck.”</p> \n<p>Labour says the plan could be funded by extending the scope of the windfall tax on energy companies, halting the proposed £400 payments for all households, and lowering government interest payments on debt due to reduced inflation.</p> \n<p>Starmer has faced criticism for the time it has taken for Labour to put out its plan. A week ago, the Liberal Democrats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/08/ed-davey-calls-for-energy-furlough-scheme-to-avoid-october-price-cap-rise\">said the energy price cap rise</a> should be stopped, while last week the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/10/gordon-brown-says-energy-firms-unable-to-offer-lower-bills-should-be-temporarily-re-nationalised\">set out his own plan</a> for the crisis.</p> \n<p>Brown took what was seen as a thinly veiled swipe at Starmer, who was away at the time, saying crises “don’t take holidays”.</p> \n<p>Asked about the comment, Starmer told BBC One’s Breakfast programme that his team had been working on the plan for more than six weeks.</p> \n<p>He added: “The second part of my answer is this: I’ve got a very important job as leader of the Labour party, leader of the opposition. But I’ve also got another job that’s really important, and that is I’m a dad.</p> \n<p>“I’m not going to apologise for going on holiday with my kids. It’s the first time we’ve had a real holiday for about three years.”</p> \n<p>Brown’s plan also calls for ministers to consider temporarily nationalising energy suppliers, as happened with banks during the 2009 financial crisis.</p> \n<p>Starmer rejected this, telling Today: “In an emergency like this, I think every penny should be used to reduce the bills of households across the country, not used to compensate shareholders in energy companies.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/15/special-delivery-review-noirish-bruiser-is-fast-and-furious-in-south-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T08:00:33Z","webTitle":"Special Delivery review – noirish bruiser is Fast and Furious in South Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/15/special-delivery-review-noirish-bruiser-is-fast-and-furious-in-south-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/15/special-delivery-review-noirish-bruiser-is-fast-and-furious-in-south-korea","fields":{"headline":"Special Delivery review – noirish bruiser is Fast and Furious in South Korea","trailText":"Parasite’s Park So-dam stars as an elite courier ferrying fugitives in an action thriller packed with dangerous driving","byline":"Phil Hoad","body":"<p>This barrelling action thriller has been billed as a Korean Fast and Furious, but takes a swift handbrake turn into something considerably darker and more introspective. Parasite’s Park So-dam stars as Eun-ha, a Busan junkyard worker who moonlights as an elite courier, ferrying fugitives. Calmly sipping a slushie as she slams her BMW through the streets, bantering with her Hawaiian-shirted boss, she is coasting through this petrolhead playground, until her latest job comes in.</p> <p>Eun-ha is tasked with going to Seoul to run a disgraced baseball player involved in a gambling scam down to the docks where he can flee abroad. But there’s a snag: he is caught by Jo (Song Sae-byeok, channelling Gary Oldman’s linen-suited mania from Leon), a corrupt police officer running the racket, so she only manages to pick up his son Seo-won (Jung Hyun-jun). The kid is carrying the security fob needed to access an account holding millions, and Eun-ha finds herself thrust into the role of reluctant parent with the capital’s bent cops on her trail.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIuWQPIaDFw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RIuWQPIaDFw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It’s a labyrinthine setup for an action film, one that blooms almost noirishly as the chase unfolds and Seo-won’s vulnerability triggers dormant compassion in Eun-ha. As we learn when Jo brings on board a special investigator, she is a North Korean defector (who, in South Korean films, often seem to have almost superhuman capabilities). Against her best judgment, she starts to surrender to the feelings of estrangement and abandonment awakened by the boy. In essence, it’s the same “family” message as Fast and Furious – but it’s a hard-won realisation here, not a contractually obliged refrain.</p> <p>Sometimes the joins show on the bodywork where director Park Dae-min, in his third feature, solders this traumatic material to the cocky popcorn-flick register. If there’s a similar ad hoc quality to some of the plotting, this pragmatism serves the action sequences well. Not just packed with slick driving, they are driven by a furious improvisation, too, from jamming legs in car doors to Jo stapling his wounds shut. Like Drive My Car’s chauffeur gone rogue, Park So-dam is an interestingly sullen, uningratiating heroine, and this bruiser of a film reminds us that even middling Korean genre fare is a cut above.</p> <p>• Special Delivery is available on digital platforms on 22 August.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/15/barclays-pulls-financial-safety-net-as-cost-of-living-crisis-bites","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T08:00:33Z","webTitle":"Barclays pulls financial safety net as cost of living crisis bites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/15/barclays-pulls-financial-safety-net-as-cost-of-living-crisis-bites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/15/barclays-pulls-financial-safety-net-as-cost-of-living-crisis-bites","fields":{"headline":"Barclays pulls financial safety net as cost of living crisis bites","trailText":"Current account holders are being told their arranged overdraft facility will be withdrawn","byline":"Anna Tims","body":"<p>Barclays customers claim they are losing a vital financial safety valve during the cost of living crisis after the bank abruptly withdrew their unused overdraft facilities. The bank has written to a number of its current account holders informing them that their overdraft limit will be removed with a month’s notice because they have not used it for 12 months.</p> <p>Many say they were counting on the provision in case soaring bills tip their accounts into the red. Andrew Davey, who has banked with Barclays for more than 30 years, was informed that his £1,400 overdraft was being withdrawn as he had not used it in the past year.</p> <p>“I asked if they could just reduce it to £400 as I wanted it as a safety cushion in case of account issues, and spent 40 minutes providing all my financial information, including my income and a very detailed breakdown of expenditure,” he says.</p> <p>He adds: “I have just received a text to tell me that my request was not accepted, and it will be removing all my overdraft facility. I really cannot understand why they are pushing customers away.”</p> <p>Clare Illingworth Leach has banked with Barclays since 1980 and has a £150 overdraft which she has never yet used. “I received a letter stating that it would be removed. So did all the people I know who bank with Barclays,” she says. “I sent them a letter, as invited, asking them not to remove my modest overdraft facility. They ignored me and revoked it without replying. I am housebound [and] on a very small income, and I wanted to retain it as a cushion in case of fraudulent transactions depleting my account, which has happened twice in five years.”</p> <p>Barclays says it has been reviewing overdrafts since last year to protect customers from unaffordable levels of debt. It says: “We review all personal arranged overdraft limits at least once a year, taking into account all the financial information we have about each customer.</p> <p>“Where this suggests that a personal arranged overdraft limit may be too high, we will plan to reduce it to a lower limit, taking into account how much of the overdraft has been used over the past 12 months. If the overdraft hasn’t been used at all for a long time, we may remove it.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>‘The practice of slashing and removing overdraft limits is hardly within the spirit of the regulations</p> <footer> <cite>Martyn James, Resolver</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It adds: “If customers feel they are able to afford their current limit, they will need to provide additional information to confirm their income and expenditure, so we can meet our requirements as a responsible lender.”</p> <p>Some customers have speculated that the move is to protect Barclays’s own finances, since overdraft facilities, whether used or not, have to be funded and shown as debt on the accounts of the bank.</p> <p>Andrew Hagger, a personal finance expert at website <a href=\"http://moneycomms.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Moneycomms.co.uk</a>, says he is unaware of other banks doing the same thing, but he expects to see the practice become more widespread as the financial crisis bites.</p> <p>“Barclays [and other banks] will undoubtedly have reviewed underwriting and risk strategies, as they know some customers are going to face financial difficulties as the cost of living crisis rumbles on,” he says. “Some customers will have been granted overdraft limits when the economic situation was far more positive and stable, but now the landscape and their disposable incomes look very different.”</p> <p>According to complaints website Resolver, while other banks are also removing overdrafts, Barclays appears to be the biggest offender. “Banks have a responsibility to ensure customers don’t get into debt,” says spokesperson Martyn James.</p> <p>“But given the fact that credit card interest rates are reaching the highest levels since the 1990s, and other forms of lending are also creeping up to their highest rate in decades, the removal, or reduction, of overdraft rates seems counterproductive as millions of households struggle to make ends meet. The practice of slashing and removing overdraft limits is hardly within the spirit of the regulations.”</p> <p>Banks have a regulatory requirement to treat customers fairly, and financial regulator the Financial Conduct Authority says it is monitoring the situation with overdrafts.</p> <p>It says: “When making changes to available credit, we expect firms to consider the circumstances of their customers, including any vulnerability, to communicate clearly, and to allow people time and opportunity to challenge and complain if they disagree.</p> <p>“With the cost of living rising, more consumers may need to turn to the credit market, including overdrafts. Lenders need to treat people fairly as individuals and consider their needs.”</p> <h2>Cheaper alternatives to overdrafts</h2> <p>Overdrafts are one of the most expensive forms of debt, with the cost of credit on many accounts running at almost 40%. One of the best rates at present is 15% from Starling Bank, according to financial information site Moneyfacts.</p> <p>Nationwide’s FlexDirect offers a 0% overdraft but only for a year, and for those that are eligible.</p> <p>Anyone who wants to pay off what they owe is advised by MoneySavingExpert’s Martin Lewis to use savings to do so, as the interest rates that you get from money in the bank are far less than the cost of using the overdraft.</p> <p>Another option is to use a 0% interest credit card, but you will have to be eligible and ensure that you pay it off within the time frame.</p> <p>A balance transfer fee typically applies of about 3% but this should be checked with the providers. <strong>Shane Hickey</strong></p> <p>• This article was amended on 17 August 2022. An earlier version wrongly suggested that Barclays customers face paying high interest rates and charges if they are forced into using an unauthorised overdraft: Barclays customers cannot go over their overdraft limit, and there are no fees for attempting to make a purchase that would take a customer over their agreed limit.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/15/admire-rushdie-writer-champion-flesh-and-blood","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T08:00:33Z","webTitle":"Admire Rushdie as a writer and a champion – but don’t forget he is a man of flesh and blood | Nesrine Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/admire-rushdie-writer-champion-flesh-and-blood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/admire-rushdie-writer-champion-flesh-and-blood","fields":{"headline":"Admire Rushdie as a writer and a champion – but don’t forget he is a man of flesh and blood","trailText":"For decades, we have asked the novelist to carry the weight of our anxieties.

It is to be called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQesGoK5AaM\">Fatwa! The Musical</a> – a Broadway rendering of the Salman Rushdie affair. This angers an ayatollah in Iran, who issues a fatwa on David’s life. All his backers vanish, he walks around in a disguise unable to live his life, and hires an overly paranoid, aggressive bodyguard, who also has very demanding taste in food and thread counts.</p> <p>Fed up, David seeks out, and is granted an audience with Salman Rushdie. In a terrific coup, the man who receives David is played by Rushdie himself. Rushdie sits David down, chides him for being afraid and tells him the biggest secret about being the subject of a fatwa – “fatwa sex”.</p> <p>“There are a lot of women who are attracted to you in this condition,” explains Rushdie. “The fatwa is wrapped around you, like a kind of sexy pixie dust,” he says, “but you have to stop acting like a wuss. Be a man, stop this, and fatwa sex will follow.” The show’s executive producer has said that the pixie dust line was “<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/curb-your-enthusiasm-larry-davids-fatwa-salman-rushdies-cameo-1049316/\">100% Salman Rushdie</a>”.</p> <p>One surprisingly fun thing about this performance, and there are many (the most striking of which is just how good an actor Rushdie is), is how Rushdie voluntarily skewers his status as some priestly symbol. A fatwa bifurcates a person into either a demon or an angel. In this, Rushdie is neither, refusing to play either of the roles that were assigned to him decades ago..</p> <p>Because, over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/12/salman-rushdie-timeline-novelist-career-satanic-verses\">33 years</a> since the fatwa against Rushdie was issued, he has been involuntarily cast as a divisive central character in a series of ersatz cultural and geopolitical conflicts. Like leaders, crises are made, not born. And the timing of the publication of The Satanic Verses teased out many strands of a globe in flux that wrapped themselves around Rushdie.</p> <p>At the time of the fatwa, the Ayatollah Khomeini had notions not just of “supreme leadership” of Iran, but of all Muslims globally, having stabilised his regime after the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis nine years earlier. The fatwa, in fact, came a whole six months after the publication of the book.</p> <p>Before Iran, it had actually been India that had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19566894\">first taken action against Rushdie</a>, banning the import of the book in a hapless attempt by Rajiv Gandhi’s government to prevent its “misuse” by religious fanatics. Other governments had their own agendas. I remember the new government in Sudan banning the book to burnish its credentials as a player on the Arab stage, even though the country was impoverished and few had even heard of the book.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/12/tsunami-outrage-salman-rushdie-satanic-verses\">A tsunami of outrage: Salman Rushdie and The Satanic Verses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These cowardices and cynicisms then coalesced into a contour of Muslim identity, one that Muslim minorities in the west could latch on to. All this was then pressed into servicing a “clash of civilisations” course of politics and culture that saw conflict between the “Muslim world”, whatever that meant at the time, and the west as inevitable.</p> <p>And, for two decades, it seemed like it was inevitable, with western invasions and terrorist attacks defining the era. But the world began to change and interests moved on. Al-Qaida and then Islamic State ran out of steam, then purpose. And with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the US and the UK ran out of appetite for costly projections of power when they had more pressing matters to attend to at home.</p> <p>Since 2016, Brexit and its ensuing economic and culture wars have become the new clash of values. In the same year, the US was dragged into similar discord. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/17/voters-in-west-divided-more-by-identity-than-issues-survey-finds\">politics of identity</a> became central to these new conflicts, and with them came vexatious questions about the parameters of free speech in societies with vulnerable minorities, the policing of white supremacy and far-right violence, and what constitutes proportional response to offence.</p> <p>Once again, Rushdie is seen as a totem in these tussles. Someone who stands, even more so since his stabbing, as both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/salman-rushdie-teaches-us-an-invaluable-lesson\">an inspiration</a> and a warning to all those who take the right of free speech for granted. The enemies today aren’t Muslims or beardy clerics, but those described as social justice warriors, whose overzealousness in protecting marginalised identities wields what some equate to a fatwa: self-censorship, no-platforming, “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/cancel-culture-books-anti-church-lgbtq-banned-us\">cancellation</a>”.</p> <p>There is an inevitability but also a danger in crowbarring Rushdie as a fixed point of moral centre into these messy and often not straightforward fights – both 30 years ago and today. He is, as both a writer and a thinker, far more and far less than that, one who only a few weeks ago said he was happy that his books were being reviewed on the arts pages rather than in the political sections of the newspapers. A brilliant writer who knows rather too well that he is a brilliant writer, he guarded his position as fatwa oracle less jealously than that of a literary figure.</p> <p>There are two tragedies to Rushdie’s life. The first is that it has all caught up with him. In the end it came for him no matter how hard he had worked and succeeded in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/salman-rushdie-had-started-to-believe-his-life-was-normal-again\">transcending it</a>, no matter how the world had changed. Every era leaves remnants of its darkness with us. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/13/hadi-matar-charged-with-attempted-of-salman-rushdie\">accused attacker</a> was born a decade after the fatwa was issued.</p> <p>The second tragedy is that he had to work so hard in the first place to get away from the fatwa as both a physical threat and a professional one. And so in his hospital bed he is best honoured not solely with accounts of near martyrdom, but also with a heightened understanding that this is a man of flesh and blood who is not there only to carry the weight of our anxieties, or even his own.</p> <p>A death threat almost fulfilled is a heavy thing to approach with this perspective, but as Rushdie himself said to Larry David when he asked him how he felt about the risks of the fatwa itself, fatwa sex aside: “Well, you know, it’s there. But fuck it.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The show, originally curated by the National Gallery during Cherri’s time as artist in residence, opens on 12 August. The Herbert will present five works by the Lebanese artist, whose varied practice spans sculpture, film and installation and is concerned with the meaning of the built environment and its histories.</p> <p>“Ali’s work really resonated with us as a museum,” Roberts says. “He explores themes of archaeology and natural history, how museums classify those subjects and how acts of violence and warfare can manifest today.”</p> <p>Acts of violence – and the exploration of their associated trauma – are key to both the history of Coventry and to Cherri’s works. Each of the artist’s sculptures is offered in response to another, previously damaged artwork, asking what should happen to these vandalised works and what their role in the development of new narratives might be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/oct/08/defaced-artworks-rothko-leonardo-in-pictures\">Art attack: defaced artworks from Rothko to Leonardo - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most famous of these damaged works is Diego Velázquez’s The Toilet of Venus (“The Rokeby Venus”), attacked with a cleaver by the suffragette Mary Richardson in 1914. Cherri’s own response to the renowned painting – and the trauma inflicted upon it – is equally political.</p> <p>His interpretation of Velázquez’s Venus is a monumental wooden sculpture, which forms the centrepiece of If You Prick Us, Do We Not Bleed?. “This depiction includes the kind of scars that were on the original artefacts – evidence of wounds, trauma, damage to an object,” says Roberts.</p> <p>But, despite the prevalence of these wounds, Cherri’s aim is not to highlight violence, but to explore how, through the display of alternative artworks, dominant histories can be questioned. It’s an aim with which Roberts is very much aligned.</p> <p>“When people attack pictures, it can be like being interested in a car crash, there’s a kind of morbid fascination,” he says. “But visitors will be within the same building as our peace and reconciliation collection, just across the way from the ruins of the old cathedral. I hope they’ll be able to view the works in the context of Coventry, to see their deeper meaning.”</p> <h2>Choice cuts: Ali Cherri on his work</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dee4ca355cdbec28dca2bc2b61b42debd7f60116\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dee4ca355cdbec28dca2bc2b61b42debd7f60116/0_0_2480_1643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Cherri’s The Adoration of the Golden Calf, after Poussin, 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Cherri’s The Adoration of the Golden Calf, after Poussin, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The National Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Adoration of the Golden Calf, after Poussin<br></strong>Cherri wanted to take back characters from the Adoration: “I created this plinth base, on top is the taxidermied conjoined lamb from the 1930s.

It was a time in his career when he had already been identified as a future England star and the notion of playing out what appears to be his dotage in the obscurity of the A-League could scarcely have been further from his mind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/manchester-united-clearout-needed-brentford-premier-league\">A Manchester United clearout is needed.

I want to be the best player in the league.”</p> <p>Last week, after scoring three goals in 14 appearances for Wanderers, Rodwell was released at the end of his contract. His former employer released a short, perfunctory statement thanking the 31-year-old for his “contribution to the club”.</p> <p>It was a considerably greater contribution than he made at his previous club. Signed by Chris Wilder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/06/jack-rodwell-sheffield-united-point-to-prove\" title=\"\">when Sheffield United were still in the Premier League</a>, Rodwell was let go after a disastrous 18-month spell during which he spent just 73 minutes across two appearances on the pitch. A combination of injuries, a spell out with Covid and his inability to force his way into a high-performing side did little to disabuse the widely held notion that here was a once-stellar talent whose career was in irreversible decline.</p> <p>An Everton fan who joined the club as a seven-year-old before forcing his way into the first team under David Moyes at 16, Rodwell impressed enough during his teenage years to win the first of three England caps at the age of 20 and earn a £12m move to the reigning champions Manchester City. After a promising first season under Roberto Mancini, he failed to kick on under the Italian’s successor Manuel Pellegrini, who was spoiled with midfield options and had little or no time for an injury-prone player who was invariably unavailable. After two seasons at the Etihad Stadium Rodwell agitated for a move elsewhere and elected to move to what was at the time, arguably the biggest basket-case of a club in England, a decision that would end up doing his reputation irreparable harm.</p> <p>Rodwell’s four-year spell at Sunderland coincided with the club’s very public descent into a tailspin that led eventually to back-to-back relegations from the Premier League. On the pitch, he pulled off the mind-blowing feat of personally participating in 39 consecutive matches without finishing on the winning side, but it was for his contributions (or conspicuous lack thereof) behind the scenes that Rodwell became something of a footballing pariah.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b18714a36a8b786fb149696d5cd4d0e0f0a8126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b18714a36a8b786fb149696d5cd4d0e0f0a8126/178_824_4394_2636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Rodwell shows his frustration playing for Sunderland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodwell became something of a footballing pariah during his struggles for Sunderland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Horrocks/Sunderland AFC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During his final two seasons on Wearside, Sunderland was reduced to the status of international laughing stock courtesy of the club hierarchy’s decision to allow a camera crew behind the scenes to record their hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/10/sunderland-til-i-die-plight-merely-very-good-football-player\" title=\"\">fly-on-the-wall documentary Sunderland ’Til I Die</a>. What was originally conceived as a vanity project showed a club in complete turmoil, the dysfunction permeating from the boardroom down on show for all to see.</p> <p>Unfairly, by his own account, Rodwell became the poster boy for Sunderland’s decline, an apparent treatment-room staple who seemed to have no interest whatsoever in playing for employers who, despite their straitened circumstances, were reported to be paying him £70,000 a week as a non-playing Championship player who would eventually see off six different permanent managers during his time at the Stadium of Light. At one stage during the documentary’s second series, the then chief executive, Martin Bain, can be seen slamming a door and turning the air blue after failing to persuade Rodwell to terminate his contract and leave the club.</p> <p>“The cameras became normal but it was a bad time for me,” said Rodwell last year. “I was in the process of getting thrown under the bus for being in the building. Everyone inside the club will tell you I wasn’t a bad lad. I did everything that was asked of me and more whereas other players wouldn’t have.” Reduced to the status of a club outcast who was resented by fans, had fallen out with his manager and was, on his rare forays from the physio room, forced to train with the kids, Rodwell left in ignominy after four largely unhappy years in 2018.</p> <p>Since then, attempted career reboots in England have amounted to little and now Rodwell’s football journey will continue on the other side of the world. Following his release from Wanderers, he has been snapped up by their city rivals Sydney FC. Speaking after securing the player’s services on Friday, their head coach. Steve Corica, sounded optimistic, if endearingly naive. “Jack’s ability is unquestionable, he’s played at the very highest level and he has adapted to the Australian conditions extremely well,” he said. “I expect him to get even better this season; he is still in his peak years as a footballer and can excel in various positions.”</p> <p>Although he can, there is no guarantee that he will, and all available evidence suggests Rodwell’s peak years actually came at Everton well over a decade ago. The court of public opinion has long since found him guilty of squandering his immense talent, a particularly heinous crime in football circles. Only he knows if his unfulfilled potential is the result of bad luck, bad decisions or a bad attitude, although the smart money may be on a combination of all three.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/15/im-desperate-how-gillian-wearing-exposed-our-innermost-thoughts","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T07:00:32Z","webTitle":"‘I’m desperate’: how Gillian Wearing exposed our innermost thoughts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/15/im-desperate-how-gillian-wearing-exposed-our-innermost-thoughts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/15/im-desperate-how-gillian-wearing-exposed-our-innermost-thoughts","fields":{"headline":"‘I’m desperate’: how Gillian Wearing exposed our innermost thoughts","trailText":"In the third of our new series about artworks by women that are relevant today, our writer looks at a series of photographs that revealed the worries of people facing an economic recession","byline":"Katy Hessel","body":"<p>A man in a suit holds up a sign saying: “I’m desperate”.

She photographed passersby and asked them to write their innermost thoughts on a piece of white paper to hold up for her and us to see. The work, Signs That Say What You Want Them to Say and Not Signs That Say What Someone Else Wants You to Say removes the veil between the things we think in private and the way society expects us to behave. </p> <p>By revealing the truth of how someone feels in a private moment while displaying how they would like to be publicly perceived – through hair, clothes, jewellery, shoes – Wearing forces us to question our expectations of how we view others in society. Should a man in a suit be desperate? Should a police officer ask for help?

In an interview, Wearing revealed that the man who wrote “I’m desperate” was “shocked by what he had written, which suggests it must have been true. Then he got a bit angry, handed back the piece of paper and stormed off.” His sudden moment of candour makes us think about what we might write ourselves.</p> <p>By engaging with real people at real moments, Wearing’s Signs becomes universal and timeless. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/04/gillian-wearing-whitechapel-gallery-feature\">Speaking to the Guardian in 2012</a>, she said, “The idea of Signs is that if you approached anyone they would have something interesting to say. I never picked people. If they grasped the idea I was making art rather than a survey, then they tended to be intrigued.”</p> <p>Signs was made in the wake of the early 1990s recession, when Britain was in the throes of uncertainty. Markets were vulnerable, oil prices had jumped to a record high and unemployment had risen nearly 4% in three years. When put into context, Signs acts as a record of the individuals whose lives were shaped by this time. By speaking to people on a personal level, it reveals their thoughts about the state of the current social, political and financial climate. This is something that feels unnervingly similar to the world today and the cost of living crisis we are facing.</p> <p>As we prepare for one of the worst winters on record, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/09/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-4266-from-january\">average annual household bills expected to reach more than £4,200</a> from January, the words “desperate” or “help” resonate more than ever. The cost of food, clothes and other necessities are rising at worrying rates while oil and gas conglomerates disclose extortionate profits. Meanwhile, an apathetic government refuses to take the urgent action that is clearly required.

For one older head in the press room, it brought back bitter Manchester United memories of a 5-0 Crystal Palace ransacking that brought the end of Frank O’Farrell as manager in December 1972. For a moustachioed Don Rogers skating across a Selhurst Park bog read Josh Dasilva, Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney in the sun. A historic, celebratory day for Brentford was one of infamy for United. So poor was their display, so ineffectual has Erik ten Hag been that comparisons are being drawn with fellow Ajax alumnus Frank de Boer’s disastrous 77 days at Palace in 2017. Already, Ten Hag is in severe danger of being flushed down a talent vortex that has claimed Jadon Sancho and Harry Maguire. The pair cost £153m between them. Both were dreadful at Brentford, though were far from alone in that. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Brentford 4-0 Manchester United</a></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>2) Conte needs to back new signing Bissouma</strong></h2> <p>Persuading Daniel Levy to open his wallet is surely one of the greatest achievements of Antonio Conte’s career, but for as long as he refrains from using his new players, it barely matters. Though it does make some kind of sense to retain the men who earned a Champions League spot, emphasising the point that places are earned by performances, not purchase prices, there is an Yves Bissouma-shaped hole in Tottenham’s midfield that on another day would’ve cost them the game. It’s true that Pierre-Emile Højbjerg scored a crucial goal, but it’s equally true that they were lucky to be only one down at the time. Højbjerg is an honest toiler, but his lack of speed and vision remain a big problem for his team – especially given Conte’s preference of a 3-4-3 formation that leaves Spurs light in the middle of midfield. Bissouma, on the other hand, is quicker to the ball, stronger once he’s got it and cleverer in moving it on – dynamism his team sorely needs. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afb253bb5ff128bea23cf761fd228414945f4aac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afb253bb5ff128bea23cf761fd228414945f4aac/0_0_4489_2993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yves Bissouma acknowledges Spurs fans after the draw at Chelsea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yves Bissouma acknowledges Spurs fans after the draw at Chelsea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Hammers looking to find rhythm</strong></h2> <p>David Moyes was in no mood to deliberate after West Ham slipped to a second successive defeat, though it was not for the want of trying at Nottingham Forest; they had a goal disallowed, twice hit the underside of the crossbar and Declan Rice saw a penalty saved. Moyes said he hopes their Europa Conference League playoff first leg at home to Viborg on Thursday will help them establish some rhythm after a disappointing start. It is a game that could also see Gianluca Scamacca and Maxwel Cornet, two of West Ham’s five summer signings, handed starts. West Ham have struggled for goals in pre-season and they are pointless and goal-less so far this campaign. “We’re a wee bit slow, a wee bit behind it,” Moyes said. “We might just take a bit of time to get up and running. We’re still finding our way at the moment.” <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-west-ham-premierr-league-match-report\">Nottingham Forest 1-0 West Ham</a></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>4) Haaland is changing City’s style</strong></h2> <p>Erling Haaland had eight touches in Saturday’s cruise against Bournemouth, a surprise to many considering how much possession City enjoyed. The Norwegian, however, did remarkable work to set up Ilkay Gündogan’s opener with two of his touches. He is not there to be part of the buildup every time – Pep Guardiola has signed him to score. “I think he did well today. If he doesn’t score they will say it but he set up the first goal, he had a couple of chances and he was there,” Kevin De Bruyne said. “He helped us make these chances, he did what he had to do and on another day he will score. It’s all good for me.” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/07/west-ham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Haaland scored twice at West Ham</a> and his career record speaks for itself. There is no doubt his arrival has changed City’s style, which will keep opponents on their toes. The focus should be on what he does, rather than what he doesn’t do. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/manchester-city-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Manchester City 4-0 Bournemouth</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>5) Buendía makes case to start for Villa</strong></h2> <p>Steven Gerrard took exception to being told that Aston Villa are a much better team with Emiliano Buendía and that the Argentinian playmaker must be a regular starter. “You don’t pick my team,” the Villa manager told his post-match inquisitor, albeit with a smile. Villa were more polished and inventive after Buendía replaced the injured Philippe Coutinho against Everton, the former Liverpool and Barcelona player again showing flashes of quality but flattering to deceive overall. It was not only Buendía’s goal that pressed his claims for inclusion at Crystal Palace next Saturday. “We’ve got good options in the final third,” said Gerrard. “Emiliano is one of them and he will start games for me. He was winning the race to start the season and got a muscle injury behind closed doors against Fulham. That forced him out for a week and his training was not at the same level when he came back. I’ve done the right thing by Emiliano in protecting his health, first and foremost, but he will get his starts.” <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/aston-villa-everton-premier-league-match-report\">Aston Villa 2-1 Everton</a></em></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>6) Caicedo bossing Brighton’s midfield</strong></h2> <p>Despite losing his best players in consecutive summers, Graham Potter does not have free rein to spend. Instead, he has to turn inward. Yves Bissouma’s departure left a considerable midfield hole to plug, and the 20-year-old Moisés Caicedo is filling it nicely. Already a seasoned Ecuador international, Caicedo spent the first half of last season on loan at the Belgian side Beerschot. But in 10 starts since his debut, Brighton have lost just once – at the Etihad – conceding only nine. His work on the ball needs polishing, but off it he gleams already. On Saturday, having dominated the midfield at Old Trafford <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/07/manchester-united-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">on the opening weekend</a>, Caicedo was at it again. Bruno Guimarães was twice stopped, as was Allan Saint-Maximin in full flight. Promising signs. <strong>Sam Dalling</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/brighton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">Brighton 0-0 Newcastle</a></em></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2e5e331ec9391cb3ce4631790f2b2ca43f769bbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e5e331ec9391cb3ce4631790f2b2ca43f769bbb/0_0_4089_2726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moises Caicedo of Brighton tackles Newcastle United’s Bruno Guimarães\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moisés Caicedo of Brighton tackles Newcastle United’s Bruno Guimarães.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>7) Rodgers hungry for summer signings</strong></h2> <p>Brendan Rodgers didn’t try to hide his frustration at Leicester’s lack of new arrivals after seeing the Arsenal new boy Gabriel Jesus orchestrate a 4-2 victory on Saturday. Having made the goalkeeper Alex Smithies their first signing of the window last week on a free transfer, financial difficulties mean the club that finished fifth in successive seasons and won the FA Cup in 2021 must sell players first before any recruitment is possible, with Chelsea expected to follow up on their interest in Wesley Fofana this week. “It’s just unfortunate because I’m an ambitious coach and I came here to challenge the established order at the top end of the league. But for that you need to constantly evolve and improve,” Rodgers said. “But I respect the club and I trust the club and if we can’t then my focus goes on to the existing players we have and trying to maximise their potential.” <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/arsenal-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal 4-2 Leicester</a></em></p> <h2><strong>8) New arrivals bolster Saints’ attack</strong></h2> <p>Any suggestion Ralph Hasenhüttl has lost the Southampton dressing room was swiftly dispelled by the way his team rallied to deny Leeds. His use of the bench, with the team trailing 2-0 in the second half, was inspired with the summer signings Joe Aribo and Sékou Mara heavily involved in their comeback. These two attacking players could have a significant role to play if Southampton are to avoid a season of struggle. Hasenhüttl must be tempted to quickly integrate them into the team because their impact was instrumental in the turnaround at St Mary’s. Aribo’s goal and Mara’s assist for the equaliser offered a potential blueprint for Southampton to develop their attacking game. The loss of Armando Broja, after his return to Chelsea, and an over-reliance on the set-piece brilliance of James Ward-Prowse need to be addressed and perhaps Aribo and Mara can offer the dynamism needed in the final third. <strong>Simon Mail</strong></p> <p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/southampton-leeds-premier-league-match-report\">Southampton 2-2 Leeds</a></em></p> <h2><strong>9) Fulham show steel if not cutting edge</strong></h2> <p>If Fulham were too lightweight for the Premier League under Slavisa Jokanovic and Claudio Ranieri, then too leaden under Scott Parker, early signs suggest they have struck a better balance under Marco Silva. Having opened the campaign with a battling 2-2 draw against Liverpool, they were similarly feisty at Wolves. While they showed their squishier side in the first half – the back four leaving Marek Rodak to sweep up against Pedro Neto and Hwang Hee-chan before he made a mess of his own, taking out Tosin Adarabioyo and almost allowing Daniel Podence to score – they looked much more muscular after the break. Aleksandar Mitrovic sailed close to the wind, as ever, when he clashed with Morgan Gibbs-White in injury time, avoiding a red card more by luck than judgment as the pent-up frustration of his squandered penalty spilled over. Silva can still be pleased with an assertive second-half performance and a first clean sheet of the campaign, even if José Sá denied his side a first win. <strong>Will Magee</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/wolves-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">Wolves 0-0 Fulham</a></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>10) Blues need new striker to complete squad</strong></h2> <p>Chelsea were far better than Tottenham, outnumbering and outplaying them in midfield – control which meant they dominated in wide areas too. But they still lack a reliable scorer, and for as long as that remains the case, it’s hard to see them winning enough games to seriously challenge for the title. Perhaps Raheem Sterling will fill the gap, but the sense persists that he is better deployed out wide. Although he can be relied upon for a decent number of goals a season, nothing we’ve seen from him suggests that his finishing is sufficiently accomplished to regularly make the difference when it gets tight. Even before N’Golo Kanté got injured, it was easy to understand why Thomas Tuchel wanted Frenkie de Jong for his midfield – he’s of an entirely different order to Jorginho – but he would be better advised to find the best striker for his system and spend whatever it takes to bring him to the Bridge. <strong>DH</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-table\"

Guardian environment editor","byline":"John Vidal","body":"<p>With more than 30 million people in England and Wales facing a hosepipe ban, and thunderstorms expected but no meaningful rainfall likely for many weeks, it’s worth asking what we have learned so far in the great drought of 2022.</p> <p>Here’s a bit of a list, by no means complete.</p> <p><strong>Water companies leak more than </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.water.org.uk/news-item/water-industry-2020-21-performance-data/\">3bn litres </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.water.org.uk/news-item/water-industry-2020-21-performance-data/\">a day</a></strong><strong>.</strong> That is enough to supply almost 22 million people with their daily water needs of around 142 litres. In some areas, companies are leaking nearly a quarter of all the water they are expensively treating. Thames Water is the largest and the worst company of all, losing more than 635m litres of water a day. All companies regularly pledge to reduce leaks – as they have for many years – but many expect to make cuts of only 50% in the next 20 years. Ofwat figures show that leakage rates have more or less remained the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62464387\">same for 20 years</a>. So much for 20 years of promises.</p> <p><strong>E</strong><strong>ngland and Wales are the only countries in the world to have fully privatised their water supplies</strong><strong>.</strong> Following intense international grassroots opposition from the 1990s onwards, all other countries retained some state control over pricing, investment and quality. The <a href=\"https://www.gre.ac.uk/articles/public-relations/nationalisation-would-save-uk-billions-greenwich-research-reveals\">evidence suggests</a> that privatisation in England and Wales has led to higher bills, little or no reduction in pollution or waste, and no greater water security. That’s called progress.</p> <p><strong>Climate change is a growing part of the problem, but so, too, </strong><strong>are underinvestment, greed, mismanagement and failed regulation.</strong> According to Andrew Sells, the chairman of Natural England from 2014 to 2019, Ofwat has allowed the water companies over the past 20 years to borrow at unsustainable levels, while paying out excessive dividends to shareholders <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2022/08/09/water-firms-sold-reservoirs-could-have-eased-drought/\">rather than investing</a> in capital equipment. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has had its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/23/environment-agency-needs-120m-grant-restored-to-protect-rivers-says-ceo\">budgets slashed</a> to the point that it is unable to prevent pollution. Follow the money, as they say.</p> <p><strong>English and Welsh water companies have handed their shareholders </strong><strong>billions of pounds since privatisation, including more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/england-privatised-water-firms-dividends-shareholders\">£57bn in dividends</a> from English firms alone in the past 30 years.</strong> By contrast, Scottish Water – which is publicly owned – has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/12/drought-uk-england-privatised-water-climate-emergency-government\"> invested nearly 35%</a> more per household in infrastructure, and Welsh Water became a not-for-profit company in 2001. Research by the Liberal Democrats suggests water company executives in England were awarded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/08/ban-bonuses-for-water-firm-bosses-until-they-fix-leaky-pipes-say-lib-dems\">£27m in bonuses</a> over the past two years, despite pumping out raw sewage into waterways 1,000 times a day. Southern Water, which has brought in a hosepipe ban, paid its bosses £3.4m in bonuses last year.</p> <p><strong>Water for households costs more in England and Wales than in most regularly drought-ravaged countries in Europe.</strong> Despite having some of the heaviest and most reliable rainfall of any industrialised country, British water companies charge more than those in Spain, Germany, Italy and Greece. In this regard, we truly are out in front.</p> <p><strong>The population of Britain has grown by around 10</strong><strong> million since water privatisation,</strong> but no major reservoir has been built in England in that time, and only about 4% of UK water is regularly transferred between traditionally wet areas in the north and west and dry areas in the south and east. Levelling up has yet to happen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2022/aug/12/dead-grass-and-dried-up-rivers-drought-across-the-uk-in-pictures\">Dead grass and dried-up rivers: drought across the UK – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Water companies say they face widespread opposition in building new reservoirs,</strong> but Thames Water, Severn Trent and Southern Water, among others, have all <a href=\"https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/water-firms-sold-off-reservoirs-that-could-have-helped-ease-drought-331977/\">sold off</a> some of their reservoirs in recent years to save money, or used them to build houses. Only one new reservoir near Portsmouth currently has planning permission.</p> <p><strong>Britain has some of the most polluted water in Europe thanks to lax regulation of the companies.</strong> It has become routine for some to dump sewage into rivers to save money and there were more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/31/water-firms-discharged-raw-sewage-into-english-waters-400000-times-last-year\">400,000 water pollution incidents</a> in 2020. According to the Wildlife Trusts, rising pollution levels place 10% of freshwater and wetland species <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/water\">at risk of extinction</a>.</p> <p><strong>Despite plans to build hundreds of thousands of new homes every year,</strong> many in drought-prone areas in the south and east of England, there is little or no requirement for housebuilders to automatically install water-saving devices or incentives for consumers to use less water.</p> <p><strong>The drought that now stretches across Europe, the extreme heatwaves and the cost of living crisis</strong> are all ultimately the result of our reliance on fossil fuels, which is causing extreme changes in the distribution of water.

But if Armstrong’s belated confession that he doped to win all seven of his Tour de France titles told a story about the rotten heart of American success that felt, four decades after Watergate, somehow traditional, the Te’o affair seemed to offer a warning about the dangers of the internet at a time when techno-optimism was still all the rage – before bot accounts, misinformation, and online harassment became features of everyday life. According to <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81580141\">a new two-part documentary</a> about Te’o’s ordeal, however, premiering this Tuesday on Netflix, the scandal needs to be understood as more than the simple tale of catfishing as which it’s often presented. As it’s framed in <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81580141\">The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist</a>, the romantic hoax at the heart of Te’o’s national humiliation was about much deeper and more interesting questions of identity, faith and belonging – for minorities in particular – in early 21st century America.</p> <p>Almost a decade after the story became meme-fodder, the basic outline of the Te’o scandal is still fairly common knowledge: Te’o, a star Samoan-Hawaiian linebacker at Notre Dame, claimed that his grandmother and girlfriend had died on the same day in December 2012. An outpouring of national sympathy fired Te’o to new heights of excellence on the field, Notre Dame finished the regular season undefeated, and Te’o seemed destined to become a first-round pick in the 2013 NFL draft. There was only one problem, though, and in January 2013 that problem became international news: Te’o’s girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/17/manti-teo-imaginary-girlfriend-notre-dame\">was not real</a>. In fact, Kekua, who purported to be a student at Stanford and with whom Te’o had pursued a purely online relationship, was the Facebook creation of a young man – also, like Te’o, of Samoan ancestry – from Seattle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTj-jHfhdzo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sTj-jHfhdzo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>For Te’o, the transformation was both swift and brutal. Literally overnight, he went from an athletic pin-up who graced the cover of Sports Illustrated, to a global joke.</p> <p>As the story reverberated across the internet, Teo’o was painted as both a fool (<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2013/01/20/wxp-snl-manti-teo-hoax.hln\">Saturday Night Live showed Te’o telling a newscaster</a> about the moment he found out Lennay was dead: “A couple of months ago she called me up and said, ‘Hey I have some bad news – I’m dead,’ and I said, ‘Oh no, do you need a ride to the funeral?’”), and, potentially, a liar: many pundits speculated that Te’o may have been complicit in the scheme all along as a way to gain national attention. A grubby undertow of homophobia accompanied the salaciousness with which Te’o’s trauma was covered, dissected, and gawked at (sportswriter Mike Florio told MSNBC’s The Ed Show, “Teams want to know whether or not Manti Te’o is gay. They just want to know.”), while one news report added some racism for good measure, describing the whole affair as a “weird Polynesian plot to embarrass” Te’o.</p> <p>The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist combs through this history while showing Te’o, today, to be what he probably always was: a fundamentally decent, hard-working young man of deep Mormon faith who was perhaps a little too naive for the age of internet weaponization. One scene shows Te’o explaining how he turned to a lawyer uncle for guidance after the purportedly dead Lennay called him in late December 2012 to announce that she was in fact still alive. “My uncle immediately said, ‘I think you’re getting catfished.’ And that was the first time that somebody ever brought up the term ‘catfish.’ I didn’t know what catfishing was. Even when he explained what it was, I still couldn’t understand what that even entailed.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/12/brett-favre-how-a-scandal-in-mississippi-tarnished-an-nfl-hero\">Brett Favre: how a scandal in Mississippi tarnished an NFL hero</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The hoaxer, Naya Tuiasosopo, who has since come out as a trans woman and uses she/her pronouns, invented Lennay and gave her a Facebook profile with photos stolen from a former high school classmate and a whole constellation of extended family members and friends. It was through this Facebook account that contact with Te’o was first made; it was only thanks to Tuiasosopo’s genius for impersonating the female voice that the relationship sustained through months of texting and phone calls.</p> <p>A note appended to the start of each episode of The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist, which features extensive fresh interview footage with both Te’o and Tuiasosopo, states that “at the time of filming, subjects were not aware that [Tuiasosopo] identifies as a transgender woman.” The result is that most participants in the documentary unintentionally dead-name Tuiasosopo; this seems especially unfortunate since what makes the series most interesting is the insight it offers into Tuiasosopo’s state of mind as the perpetrator of the hoax. What emerges from that portrait is the deep confusion that Tuiasosopo felt about her own identity at the time she created Lennay.</p> <p>“The Lennay profile was not necessarily a way out but a way to something else,” she says. “At that time, I knew for sure there was something inside of me that just wanted to scream out and be like, ‘Why am I different?’ There were a couple of encounters online where it was like, ‘This guy’s cute. Let’s see where this goes.’ I knew what was right and wrong, but I was too far in love with being looked at in this way. It was completely selfish, but it was what made me happy. It was what I wanted to be a reality.”</p> <p>The glue that kept Te’o and Lennay/Naya together was not the internet as such – a mere tool in the story – as their shared background. Even though Lennay was fake, Tuaisosopo imbued the character with her own personality – her own interests, her own tastes in music, and most tellingly, her own ethnicity. Both Te’o and Tuiasosopo were young people of Samoan background and similar age – they’re now in their early 30s – trying to navigate the commitments of family and faith, two particularly important components of Samoan identity, with the sometimes-conflicting energies of life in America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc960ac28f3675908b1e517a918594c9afb08524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc960ac28f3675908b1e517a918594c9afb08524/0_143_2816_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manti Te’o is interviewed by Katie Couric in the days following the unravelling of the hoax in 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manti Te’o is interviewed by Katie Couric in the days following the unravelling of the hoax in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorenzo Bevilaqua/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many Samoan-Americans, football is often the connector to the larger culture around them. Tuiasosopo came from a distinguished footballing family – her dad played at USC, her uncle played for the Rams, and her cousin played for the Raiders – and she threw herself into football as a child in an effort to live up to that legacy.</p> <p>“But I hate football,” she says in The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist. “I just wanted to play football out of obedience, and I wanted to make my dad happy. But I totally felt this heaviness of fear. I didn’t have that courage to just be like, you know what, this is who I am. I truly believed in my heart, being natural-born male, I could never be who I wanted. That was when I had decided that I would be able to have that experience in the life of a female, even if it were fake.”</p> <p>Te’o experienced things differently: the love of football came naturally, and as a high school player it was obvious he was destined for great things. As their online relationship developed, Lennay even counseled Te’o on his defensive work, sending him text messages saying things like, “I encourage you babe to manage the pace and the flow of your defense babe.” Tuiasosopo explains: “Because we were able to have those types of conversations, Lennay became a rock for him.”</p> <p>But it’s their shared background and shared quest that makes the story of Te’o and Tuiasosopo, however unfortunate its eventual unfolding, so absorbing: whether they did it in rebellion against the sport or in concert with it, football became for both of them the canvas on which they projected their schemes to fit in, as ethnic-minority children, in white-dominated America.</p> <p>Tuiasosopo moved back to American Samoa after the scandal broke and found support among the local LGBTQ population, which includes a large and well-established community of people who identify as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/29/faafafine-yuki-kihara-celebrates-samoas-third-gender-galleries-think-they-can-tick-the-box-with-me\">fa’afafine, meaning third gender or non-binary</a>.</p> <p>“I just had to start living my life,” she says. “And I wanted to be able to live my life as trans. I still feel horrible [about the hoax], and sometimes I wish that everything had been undone. But then also another part of me was like, I learned so much about who I am today and who I want to become because of the lessons I learned through the life of Lennay.”</p> <p>For Te’o, the years since the hoax became public have been perhaps less kind: he enjoyed three moderately successful seasons at the San Diego Chargers as a second-round 2013 draft pick, but his last NFL game came in 2019. In the minutes before his first pre-season game for the Chargers, in 2013, he felt his whole body go numb.</p> <p>“The first three years at the Chargers were like that. And it was such a huge contrast to that kid at Notre Dame. The football field, that was my domain, you know. Like, when I’m on the football field, I feel like nobody can beat me. And I played free, and I played fast, and I played physical. And that was what made me great,” he says. “Now I go to the NFL, and I’m questioning everything. Every day was just trying to figure out how to get rid of this anxiety, this numbness, this tingling. I’m trying to figure out all these ways to reprogram myself.” Eventually he went to see a therapist who told him to forgive himself for the hoax: “What happened to you is not your fault,” the therapist told him.</p> <p>Despite that breakthrough, the documentary makes clear that for Te’o, the experience remains a deep source of trauma: “I’ll take all this crap,” he says. “I’ll take all the jokes, I’ll take all the memes, so I can be an inspiration to the one who needs me to be.” Hopefully, by ventilating their pain so publicly, both Te’o and Tuiasosopo will find some measure of peace in their quest to restart their still-young lives – and finally find a place of their own in the vicious turbulence of 2020s America.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/15/afghan-refugees-in-uk-told-to-find-new-homes-on-rightmove","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T06:53:18Z","webTitle":"Afghan refugees in UK told to find new homes on Rightmove","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/afghan-refugees-in-uk-told-to-find-new-homes-on-rightmove","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/afghan-refugees-in-uk-told-to-find-new-homes-on-rightmove","fields":{"headline":"Afghan refugees in UK told to find new homes on Rightmove","trailText":"Home Office urges Afghans who fled Taliban a year ago to look for accommodation in private sector","byline":"Diane Taylor","body":"<p>Thousands of Afghan refugees who have been living in UK hotels since the Taliban takeover of their country a year ago have been told by the Home Office to look for new accommodation on Rightmove or Zoopla.</p> <p>On the first anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/15/the-fall-of-kabul-a-20-year-mission-collapses-in-a-single-day\">fall of Kabul</a>, the government is still providing hotel accommodation to 9,500 Afghans who sought refuge in the UK, with only 7,000 having been rehoused.</p> <p>While charities welcomed government moves to wind down the use of hotels to house the refugees, they expressed concerns that many would not be able to find suitable accommodation in the private rented sector and risked ending up homeless.</p> <p>Afghan families with children will struggle to find accommodation large enough and that they can afford using the housing benefit provided. Charities also raised the alarm that refugees may not have the language skills to negotiate their own rental agreements, nor the necessary paperwork, such as passports and bank statements.</p> <p>Home Office sources say that as well as encouraging Afghan families living in hotels to look for their own housing, they aim to offer each family two choices of accommodation somewhere in the UK, though it is not known if they will be given a choice as to where.</p> <p>The Home Office said the accommodation offers would be “good, decent proposals”, but that if families rejected the offers a further two months of hotel accommodation would be provided. It is not clear what would happen if the families failed to secure accommodation after that.</p> <p>Home Office sources say they are trying to encourage Afghan families to move to other parts of the UK such as Wales but this may be difficult for families who are settled in large cities such as London where their children are attending school. Council housing waiting lists are long, especially for larger properties that some Afghan families require because they have three or more children.</p> <p>Although Afghan families have the right to rent under the immigration rules and landlords can check this using an online tool, some are reluctant to rent to people who do not have a British passport, or evidence of life in the UK such as utility bills and payslips.</p> <p>A letter sent by the Home Office to Afghan refugees says that not all councils will accept a request to put them on their social housing waiting lists, so urges them to start looking in the private rental sector.</p> <p>“Not all councils will support you so it’s important to check,” the letters state. They urge the refugees to search for multiple properties to increase their chances of finding somewhere as the UK housing market is “very competitive”.</p> <p>Eva Tabbasam, the director of Gender Action for Peace and Security, expressed concern about the plans. She said: “Afghan families couldn’t have imagined that one year after arriving they’d still be warehoused in unsuitable accommodation, without space, privacy and stability. There is also a serious risk of homelessness for these families if suitable accommodation is not offered under the current Home Office plans.</p> <p>“The government has had a year to sort things out – instead, it’s getting worse. If suitable accommodation was readily available for the 9,500 people still in hotels, families would already have been moved into it. We don’t yet know what kind of move on accommodation families will be offered.”</p> <p> Claire Holland London Councils’ executive member for communities, said: “Boroughs are very concerned by the lack of alternative housing options for these families – a particular challenge in the capital due to the chronic shortage of affordable housing here.”</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: “The use of hotels to house those resettling from Afghanistan is a temporary solution, and we continue to work with over 350 local authorities to move Afghan families from hotels to permanent accommodation as quickly as possible.</p> <p>“To support the resettlement of Afghan families, local authorities are given £20,520 per person over a three-year period. They have the flexibility to use this funding to contribute towards renting accommodation, including deposits, letting fees and furnishing.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/15/they-killed-freya-the-walrus-i-am-so-angry-about-her-pointless-death","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T06:49:50Z","webTitle":"They killed Freya the walrus.

I go there every Sunday to do my shopping. When I played rugby for Narbonne, the “third half” would sometimes carry on until morning, when we would arrive at 6am for a steak.

It is a timeless place: you never know which century it is. Close your eyes and you could be in the middle ages or the Renaissance. Narbonne was one of the world’s most important ports 2,000 years ago, and you can picture this when you climb to the top of the tower at the Palais des Archevêques, which has panoramic city views as far as the Mediterranean. Here you can also feel the wind, a crucial element to understanding Narbonne: 13 “winds” blow through our streets.</p> <h2><strong>Neighbourhood</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4dec81770140d1dfa98d7d9184ffa2db3e642028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dec81770140d1dfa98d7d9184ffa2db3e642028/0_368_5554_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Narbonne Plage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Narbonne Plage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Panther Media/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My neighbourhood is Narbonne Plage, a three-mile stretch of sandy beach that may be nine miles from town but remains an essential part of Narbonnais life. In summer there’s a regular bus, but the hour-long bike ride through the salt flats and wetlands is wonderful. I learned to swim here as a boy and trained for rugby by running on the beach. Families come here with their kids. This quiet resort has avoided ugly development, and visitors can enjoy sunbathing and swimming at a beach club, or ice-cream at a seafront <em>glacier</em> such as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bakouabar/\" title=\"\">Bakoua</a>, while nightlife carries on late at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/192388940440/\" title=\"\">L’Insomnia</a> disco.

My favourite spot is the Massif de la Clape, where I cultivate my vineyards, and hikers and bikers can discover wild orchids, thyme, rosemary and marjoram, and glimpse rabbits, hares and wild boar. It is also a paradise for birdwatchers. Don’t miss the Étang de Bages-Sigean, with its fishing village, where the water is incredibly still, a marked contrast with the waves and movement of the sea on the other side of the lagoon.</p> <h2><strong>Nightlife</strong></h2> <p>The towpath along Canal de la Robine has been transformed in the past few years, and the Promenade des Barques is lined with late-night spots: Le Rive Gauche and waterside terrace of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lecentauree/\" title=\"\">Le Centaurée</a>, live concerts at <a href=\"https://www.cadencenarbonne.com/\" title=\"\">Cadence</a> and craft beer and excellent wines at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/macar.baravin/\" title=\"\">Macar Bar</a>, whose host is Anthony Hill, an Aussie rugby player who ended up staying.

It is an incremental upgrade from the once-in-a-generation leap made by the M1 in 2020 but is still up to 18% faster, with 35% more powerful graphics.</p> <p>The M2 makes the MacBook Air a rapid, highly capable machine that will easily handle any general computing requirement and bursts of more demanding things. It is a fanless machine, making it completely silent in operation. The laptop stayed cool for three hours of fairly demanding photo manipulation work with large image files while attached to a separate 4K display. Unless you know your work is very computationally demanding, I would expect the Air to be more than capable for most, despite the lack of a fan for cooling.</p> <p>The battery life is still class-leading, too, regularly exceeding 16 hours of work between charges, including several hours of photo editing in Affinity Photo, having 20 or tabs open in Chrome most of the time, and using Apple Mail, Typora, Evernote and a variety of chat apps and smaller tools. You won’t need to carry the charger to lectures or work.</p> <p>It took two hours 15 minutes to fully charge the Air with the included 35W charger and MagSafe cable, hitting 50% in about an hour, but it can fast-charge to 50% with a 67W or higher-power adaptor if you have one.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d249db7f2f1c80d49b8d31243e4896f99991fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32d249db7f2f1c80d49b8d31243e4896f99991fc/636_475_3992_2396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The underside of the MacBook Air M2 showing its four circular rubber feet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bottom of the laptop is flat with circular rubber feet to raise it slightly off a desk and small screws to <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/62674/m2-macbook-air-teardown-apple-forgot-the-heatsink\">access its components</a> for repair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The MacBook Air is made with recycled materials including aluminium, steel, tin, rare earth elements and plastic.

Along with my sister and parents, I currently own a 7% share (equivalent to £17,000) in a flat that was bought in cash with inheritance that my father received after the death of my grandmother. Although my parents gave me the money equivalent to my share of the property a few years ago, I’m still on the deeds to the property and am in the process of removing myself from these.</p> <p>What I’m really hoping you can help me with is working out how much stamp duty my partner and I should expect to pay when we buy our first property. Does my name being on the deeds to the flat mean we aren’t eligible for first-time buyers’ relief? Does my having owned a share of the property mean that the new property will count as a second home?</p> <p>I would really appreciate it if you could give me any help or advice about this as it’s been confusing me for months.<br><strong>DK</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> For the past couple of hours it has been confusing me, too, but I think I’ve got to the bottom of it. What is crystal clear is that you will not have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) on your new home – even though it is treated as a second property – because your share of the flat is worth less than £40,000. This would also be the case if the property you were buying was a mixture of residential and non-residential – such as a shop with a flat above – or you were buying a movable caravan, houseboat or mobile home (unless it has become a permanent fixture and no longer goes anywhere).</p> <p>The government guidance gives the following example to illustrate why higher-rate SDLT is not payable: “A jointly owns a buy-to-let property with friends. The property is worth £150,000 with A’s share being worth £30,000. A is looking to buy a property to live in. A will not have to pay the higher rates of SDLT because A’s share of the buy-to-let property is under £40,000.”</p> <p>When it comes to first-time buyers’ SDLT relief – which is available in England and Northern Ireland on properties costing £500,000 or less and charges 0% on the first £300,000 but 5% on the amount between £300,000 and £500,000 – it is pretty clear that, according to the guidance, “in order to count as a first-time buyer, a purchaser must not, either alone or with others, have previously acquired a major interest in a dwelling or an equivalent interest in land anywhere in the world”. This includes inherited or gifted property. So that would seem to be that. Except that there is a glimmer of light in that the guidance says: “Where a transaction is liable to the higher rates for additional dwellings in schedule 4ZA FA 2003, relief cannot be claimed.” This has suggested to some commentators that if the higher rates of SDLT are not due – as in your case – you can claim first-time buyers’ relief. But it seems to be a bit of a grey area, so I suggest that if you do go on to buying somewhere, you make use of a law firm that includes SDLT specialists. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2022/aug/15/most-exciting-new-fiction-from-africa-latin-america-and-south-asia","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Page turners: the most exciting new fiction from Africa, Latin America and south Asia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/15/most-exciting-new-fiction-from-africa-latin-america-and-south-asia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/aug/15/most-exciting-new-fiction-from-africa-latin-america-and-south-asia","fields":{"headline":"Page turners: the most exciting new fiction from Africa, Latin America and south Asia","trailText":"We asked 14 writers, editors and publishers to tell us their current favourites from around the world","byline":"Compiled by Isabel Choat","body":"<h2><strong>Ellah Wakatama</strong></h2> <p>My holiday reading begins with <strong><a href=\"https://naminaforna.com/the-merciless-ones\">The Merciless Ones</a></strong>, the second young adult novel by Namina Forna.

The 12 stories in the collection capture the experience of navigating the strange and wondrous world of love and intimacy in Africa’s most enigmatic city. Kuku is a studious writer who leans into humour, satire and astute observations. She channels the complexities of Lagos as a chaotic but alluring world of dreams and tragedies, desire and heartbreak into characters who find that love or the search for love is the way to survive the stark contradictions of life in the city. Lagosians will easily recognise the swashbuckling lovers and heartbreakers in the stories. Outsiders will find them entertaining. The stories are quick reads, great for a lounge at the beach where it’s OK to laugh out loud. Kuku’s stories are delectable and fun, but they also reveal the ridiculousness of gender expectations and the sexual politics that assign men and women rigid roles in intimate relationships.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ainehiedoro?lang=en\">Dr Ainehi Edoro</a> is assistant professor of global black literatures at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and founder and editor-in-chief of <a href=\"https://brittlepaper.com/\">Brittle Paper</a>, an online magazine for African literature</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Wole Talabi</strong></h2> <p>Two of the most interesting books I’ve read recently are <strong><a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250767769/the-library-of-the-dead\">The Library of The Dead</a>,</strong> by TL Huchu, and <strong><a href=\"http://www.newconpress.co.uk/info/book.asp?id=156&amp;referer=Catalogue\">Water Must Fall</a>,</strong> by Nick Wood.</p> <p>The former is the first in a series and is a fun fantasy story set in a post-catastrophe Scotland and featuring a brash and bright teenage Zimbabwean protagonist, Ropa, who makes a living communicating with spirits.

Because I think there needs to be. And Peace Adzo Medie needs to win for the opening of her debut novel, <strong><a href=\"https://www.peacemedie.com/his-only-wife.html\">His Only Wife</a></strong>. We start the story at an unusual wedding ceremony of Afi Tekple, a young seamstress, and her mystery husband, Elikem Ganyo. As the story moves between the Ghanaian city of Ho and the country’s capital, Accra, we quickly discover that there’s another woman – a woman the Ganyo family disapprove of – and Afi has been set the herculean task of winning Elikem back on their behalf. As she contends with mounting pressure from her powerful in-laws, Afi’s journey from compliance to defiance doubles up as a fresh examination of womanhood, marriage and societal expectations. Laced with humour, and paired with her breezy writing style, Medie’s unputdownable novel proved to be an instant cure for my dwindling attention span.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NancAdimora?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Nancy Adimora</a> is a publishing consultant and the founding editor of <a href=\"http://afreada.com/\">Afreada</a>, an African literary magazine</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Carey Baraka</strong></h2> <p>Khadija Abdalla Bajaber’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/house-rust\">The House of Rust</a></strong> is the story of Aisha, a girl living in present-day Mombasa who, after her father goes missing in the ocean, sets sail one night after him.

Juan Gabriel Vásquez is a Colombian writer with the talent to keep a magician’s equilibrium between reality and fiction. In <strong><a href=\"https://www.fantasticfiction.com/v/juan-gabriel-vasquez/retrospective.htm\">Retrospective</a></strong>, Vásquez takes the real life of his compatriot, film director Sergio Cabrera, and weaves it into a fascinating piece of writing, a factual novel about the children of Fausto Cabrera, a man obsessed with revolution who sends his son and daughter to China to be indoctrinated as Maoists and then join the Colombian guerillas. The strange existence they live in China where they join the Red Guards, and their harrowing experience as guerrillas in the Colombian jungle are told alongside the story of the father, a seductive, fanatical character the children despise and love at the same time. The novel relies on facts researched by the author, through long interviews with the protagonists, but the seamless narrative filled with the ebbs and flows of dramatic tension give the story the gripping quality of fiction. Through incisive observation he conveys the father’s relationship with his children and their process to break with their past and construct a normal life for themselves. Beautifully written and gripping, the novel won the Mario Vargas Llosa Prize in 2021.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/giocondabelli\">Gioconda Belli</a> is a Nicaraguan poet and novelist.

Through the tale of caring for his mother in a provincial hospital, Herbert builds a portrait not only of his dying parent, but also of a decadent motherland (what do you call a decadent country that was never glorious to begin with?). He manages to find dark, tender humour in the family’s fight against cancer, and he expounds glorious snippets of wisdom gleaned from the depths of his own cocaine habit.

What I got, instead, is a tender love story featuring a female lower court judge and a male litigant, effortlessly combining desire, family legends, women walking out of their husbands’ lives – and a larger backdrop of communal unrest in India, captured neatly in a symbolic court case. I was utterly lost in the unravelling of this slim novel, travelling through its shimmering spaces of longing and hard spaces of conflict, collisions and contests, all seen through the eyes of the female protagonist.

Pebble Monkey is an original, quirky, thought-provoking fable, first published in Bengali in 2016 and now translated into English by Arunava Sinha. High above the Himalayan snowline, an ibex dislodges a pebble, that turns into a monkey. Sinha’s masterly translation takes us on a surreal journey with “Pebblemonkey”, who meets an assortment of characters, offers us climate insights, and challenges us with big philosophical questions.

The characters in these stories are constantly confronted with the spectres and landscapes of war. In the opening story, Playing Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, the protagonist is transported to Logar in eastern Afganistan, and to his father’s early experience of tragedy, through a video game.

The radical philosopher-critic found his faith in historical progress – and human potential itself – crushed between the great war and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response\">Great Depression</a>. Salvation came from an unexpected source: the work of a then-obscure novelist of the previous century, Herman Melville.</p> <p>Melville had died 40 years before, his life uncommemorated, his writing dismissed by critics and forgotten by the reading public. Mumford, by contrast, was a rising star in America’s intellectual firmament, an expert in fields ranging from ecology to urbanism. Articulate, urbane and promiscuous – intellectually and otherwise – Mumford seems a breed apart from the taciturn Melville. But, as Aaron Sachs reveals in his joint biography, <em>Up from the Depths</em>, the younger man found kinship and inspiration in Melville’s work.</p> <p>Both writers grappled with the chaos of modernity. Both abandoned the rationalist, utilitarian conceits of their contemporaries, advancing a romantic worldview – in social criticism and fiction, respectively. Both asked their readers to look again at everyday life. And both placed their hope in the capacity of ordinary people to overcome civilisation’s dark side: to conquer cruelty with love.</p> <p>Mumford, a once-renowned but now forgotten thinker, spent many of his 94 years studying the relationships between human beings and the technologies we create. Never quite a prophet of doom, he harboured grave doubts about the dehumanisation at work in “machine societies”; doubts that only deepened as the 20th century wore on.</p> <p>He found a “brother spirit” in the ex-mariner Melville, who glimpsed the madness lurking underneath industrialism’s civilised veneer. A youth spent at the cutting edge of colonial capitalism disabused him of Victorian illusions about scientific progress. “There is no folly of the beasts of the earth,” he wrote, “which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.” It was a message far in advance of his readership. Frustrated by <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\">Moby-Dick</a></em>’s chilly reception, Melville took a full-time job as a customs inspector, fighting through nervous exhaustion and chronic pain to keep writing in the teeth of commercial and critical failure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They are psychological siblings – haunted by depression, stalked by an unshakable sense of their life-work’s futility</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Parallels between Melville and Mumford’s lives shape <em>Up from the Depths</em>, but their differences are no less telling. Mumford drives his wife to distraction – and his daughter to psychological injury – through a series of extramarital affairs. Melville remains monogamous – although Sachs speculates that his wife suffered sleepless nights over the prevalence of lissome young men in her husband’s books. Both lose a son, but while Mumford turns his grief into productivity – his energy for work was as bottomless, and as long-lived, as his enthusiasm for adultery – Melville falls into deep, pained silence.</p> <p>It’s in trauma – and the two men’s will to endure it – that Sachs locates their most precious gift to us. Mumford and Melville are psychological siblings; haunted by depression, stalked by an unshakable sense of their life-work’s futility. But writing his biography of Melville, Mumford found strength to continue. “I owe a debt to Melville,” he later wrote, “because my wrestling with him, my efforts to plumb his tragic sense of life, were the best preparations I could have had for facing our present world.”</p> <p>As the utopian dreams of the 30s terminated in global, mechanised war, Melville’s grim outlook gained new salience for Mumford. But the “black side of human experience” led Melville not to despair but to “cosmic defiance”: a resolution to live on in spite of horror, to hope even in the face of catastrophe. It’s a vision that keeps Mumford going during the McCarthyist 1950s. And one that flowers in the radical 1960s – when Mumford’s green communitarianism came into its own.</p> <p>Ultimately, tragedy can be endured, but not escaped. The two writers grow old and frail; Mumford suffers dementia, Melville, heart disease. Neither man dies unhappy. But both die in relative obscurity.</p> <p>Sachs manages a set of impressive balancing acts: matching scholarly diligence with fluent, stylish prose; admiration for his subjects with an alertness to their flaws. <em>Up from the Depths</em> packs multiple books into one: an introduction to Mumford’s thought, an innovative study of Melville, and a history of the modern age through the eyes of two uniquely perceptive writers.</p> <p>Melville’s posthumous revival relied partly on Mumford and his peers. But it also owed much to Melville himself: his obstinate refusal to give up on the world of literature, even when it gave up on him. For Mumford and Melville, disaster was an intrinsic part of the human experience. But so was hope.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Up from the Depths: Herman Melville, Lewis Mumford, and Rediscovery in Dark Times</em> is published by Princeton University Press (£25).

It can also involve taking over or utilising an existing product, not necessarily opening a new one.”</p> <p>Being targeted by fraudsters can be distressing, while sorting it out can be time-consuming, and the crime can have a direct impact on your personal finances – affecting your credit record and making it difficult to successfully apply for credit cards, loans or mortgages. So what can you do to try to protect your identity?</p> <h2><strong>Safeguard information</strong></h2> <p>“The most important thing is safeguarding your personal information, whether it’s biographical or sign-on credentials – for online banking or Amazon, or anything like that. If someone gets access to one of your financial products, that can open up more opportunities for them,” Jones says. “Keep the lid tightly closed on personal information.”</p> <p>There is so much about all of us online, says Amber Burridge, the head of intelligence at the fraud prevention body Cifas.</p> <p>“Criminals will not just look at one source – they will look at links between the sources and social media accounts,” she says.</p> <p>“On social media, it’s best to keep settings on the highest privacy level on all accounts, including LinkedIn, which we don’t always think of in the same terms as the likes of Facebook.”</p> <h2><strong>Hang up on fraudsters</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"572f3705a8bdcd0aa21ee39a7845b0df8e3681b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/572f3705a8bdcd0aa21ee39a7845b0df8e3681b3/336_537_2166_1091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red Retro Telephone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"504\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you receive an unsolicited call purporting to be from a trusted organisation, hang up and call them on a number you know to be theirs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hypermania Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“If you get an unsolicited call or message purporting to be from a trusted organisation, hang up and call them on a number that you know to be theirs,” Burridge<strong> </strong>says. And if friends or family contact you asking for financial help, get in touch straight away – they may have been targeted by fraudsters.</p> <p>One of the latest forms of fraud is where people are contacted on WhatsApp, or via text, by crooks claiming to be family, saying they have lost their mobile and access to online banking to pay bills.</p> <h2><strong>If in doubt, don’t click</strong></h2> <p>Don’t click on third-party links, whether they arrive via social media posts, text messages or emails, or anywhere else. The simple rule is, always look up the official website. </p> <h2><strong>Be aware of fraud trends</strong></h2> <p>“Fraudsters are very good at using trends to change their tactics, and at the moment the cost of living crisis is particularly hot,” Burridge says. “We have seen an increase in criminals posing as energy companies claiming they can offer a better deal, or as supermarkets offering money-off vouchers.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have seen an increase in criminals posing as energy companies claiming they can offer a better deal</p> <footer> <cite>Amber Burridge of Cifas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Investment scams target those who need to supplement their income. Fraudsters pose as legitimate firms asking the victim to share their computer screen using remote access, so they can harvest personal and financial data.</p> <p>They have also been posing as network providers asking for details of your existing contract, so they can offer you a better deal. Once they have these details, they can order devices in your name.</p> <p>“When the government announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/17/150-pound-energy-rebate-thousands-of-households-waiting-england-wales\" title=\"\">energy rebates through council tax</a>, people started to see messages popping up saying: ‘Click here to set up your payment,’” says Jones. “If you’re not careful, you could give your bank account details to a crook.”.</p> <h2><strong>Protect passwords</strong></h2> <p>“Password managers, like 1Password or LastPass, can be a great way of creating strong passwords and keeping track of them,” says Steve Goddard, the fraud and financial crime expert at Featurespace, a firm that provides tools to banks that aim to stop stolen IDs being used fraudulently.</p> <p>For example, LastPass will generate and store passwords in an online “vault” that you can access through an authenticator on your phone.

Then, when Covid struck, her life took yet another turn","byline":"Paula Cocozza","body":"<p>Anne-Marie Newland is a mistress of career change. By the time she<strong> </strong>opened her shop, Sweet Charity, in Kensington Market in 1982, selling psychedelic clothing<strong> </strong>to, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/annie-lennox-30-greatest-songs-ranked\">Annie Lennox</a> and Kim Wilde, she was<strong> </strong>25 and had already pursued several paths. At 19, she had choreographed dancers for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/19/vangelis-greek-composer-chariots-of-fire-blade-runner-dies\">Vangelis</a> and covered classes for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/21/arlene-phillips-my-family-values\">Arlene Phillips</a>, who had taught Newland at Arts Educational London (she was then Anne-Marie Khachik).</p> <p>She was a youth worker and played drums in bands, briefly with Toyah Willcox.<strong> </strong>Later, she became a “stay-home mother” to four children, “the highlight of [her] life”, and for many years she worked as a yoga teacher and trainer. But it still feels surprising to hear her say that, at 66,<strong> </strong>she qualified as a security guard.</p> <p>As about-turns go, the yoga mat to the security tabard feels like a sharp one. “It is all about psychology,” Newland says. As a security guard, “you have to be very observant. You have to be willing to challenge, without being aggressive. I have had antiterrorist training, terrorist-awareness training, how to arrest people, how to de-escalate.” And she has found she is good at it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have always felt powerless. Wearing a uniform, I feel protected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Newland started, she enforced Covid-19 security at venues while restrictions were in place, and now manages a team at high-profile events and festivals. The job offers flexibility “and keeps you physically active”. She stands a little over 5ft tall. Is she ever scared? “No,” she says. “And that’s an interesting one. Why don’t I feel scared?”</p> <p>Since childhood, Newland has had a complicated relationship with security. She was born in Iraq and spent her early years in Kirkuk, Baghdad and Basra.<strong> </strong>“We were always moving, quickly.” She was five when she saw her father arrested at gunpoint. “He was a political prisoner” – accused of taking papers from the university where he taught draughtsmanship – “which was ridiculous.” The family fled to Leicestershire, the county Newland’s mother was from. But it was six years before her father could join them, in 1967.</p> <p>At 13, Newland won a scholarship to board at the Arts Educational School in Tring, Hertfordshire. Her parents took her on the train, with her belongings in a plastic bag. “I thought, ‘I’m just going to move on,’” she recalls.</p> <p>Tring was “a world of money, of privilege”. Newland seesawed between this and “abject poverty” when she went home – though she had never seen it as such before. The family slept on mattresses on the floor. But what stung most was “seeing how hard my parents worked”. Her father struggled to find employment. “He’d get a job – until they heard his voice on the phone, or they saw him, and suddenly the job was gone.” Police knocked often: “We were the only foreigners in the village.”</p> <p>The disconnect between home and school “taught me how to manoeuvre the world”, Newland says. “Constantly divided between two worlds – that’s my story.” The thread that joined those worlds was work. “Primarily, no matter what I’ve done in my life, I’m a worker,” she says. She got her first job at 11, cleaning a factory floor, but applied herself as she would at Tring. That’s where<strong> </strong>she recalls a teacher saying, “If your pointed shoes aren’t full of blood, you haven’t worked hard enough.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/25/a-new-start-after-60-i-didnt-want-to-be-an-invisible-old-lady-so-i-became-a-yoga-teacher\">A new start after 60: ‘I didn’t want to be an invisible old lady – so I became a yoga teacher’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even now, she retains the feeling that “you must work until you drop”. It must have been hard, then, when Newland felt her energy leave her after Covid-19 sent her yoga teacher-training business online. “I was coming up to retirement. I thought, ‘This is a natural closing down.’”</p> <p>Sometimes she wonders: “How have I ended up in security? And it occurred to me that I have always felt powerless,” she says. “It was always them and us. Wearing a uniform, I feel protected.” In a strange way, the security work has made her confront her vulnerability.</p> <p>After her mother died in 2009, Newland found that she was grieving her loss, and other losses too: Iraq, the language she grew up speaking. “You can be strong for a long time and something happens and suddenly you’re not strong,” she says. “It’s like building yourself again. I want to take off all the labels, and find out who I am – the essence of me.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/04/tell-us-has-your-life-taken-a-new-direction-after-the-age-of-65\">Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?</a> </p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/15/dvlas-driving-licence-delay-is-costing-a-fortune","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T06:00:30Z","webTitle":"DVLA’s driving licence delay is costing a fortune","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/15/dvlas-driving-licence-delay-is-costing-a-fortune","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/15/dvlas-driving-licence-delay-is-costing-a-fortune","fields":{"headline":"DVLA’s driving licence delay is costing a fortune","trailText":"My employer has had to hire taxis and the courts service is providing transport to get me to court","byline":"Zoe Wood","body":"<p><strong>I surrendered my driving licence at the start of 2021 after </strong><strong>having an epileptic </strong><strong>seizure.

In 1948, North Korea was established by Kim Il-sung – the first of three generations of the Kim dynasty to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/16/north-korea-kim-jong-il-birthday\">ruled the country with an iron fist</a>.

So what’s everyone else doing?</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Germany</strong></p> <p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/germany-dependence-russian-energy-gas-oil-nord-stream\">Russia supplied</a> over 50% of Germany’s natural gas, roughly a third of all oil, and almost half of all of its coal imports. So when Russia cut gas supplies to Germany at the end of July, the results were catastrophic. In response, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been labouring to wean the country off its heavy reliance on Russian exports of oil and gas. He has assured German citizens that they won’t be left without energy this winter or with extortionate bills landing on their doorstep.</p> <p>The first thing Scholz did was to pass emergency legislation to reactivate closed oil and coal power plants. It’s not ideal – the government’s environmentalist economics minister, Robert Habeck, has described the move as “painful but necessary”— but it is an effective way of alleviating some pressure in the short term. Scholz has also indicated that he is considering U-turning on Germany’s policy to phase out nuclear energy, and lengthening the lifetime of the country’s only three remaining nuclear plants.</p> <p>The German government is aware these are temporary responses to stop the bleeding. Looking ahead, a central part of Germany’s long term plan is to achieve energy sovereignty by investing in and scaling up the generation of renewable energy. The government is installing more solar and wind energy farms and has recently released an energy efficiency support package of $180bn to Germany’s climate and transformation fund.</p> <p><br>***</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>There are various factors exacerbating the energy crisis in France, and fewer than half of the country’s nuclear reactors are up and running because of maintenance issues.</p> <p>France has decided the best way to mitigate wider economic damage is to cap retail energy prices. This move has already played a crucial role in insulating France from the energy price shock afflicting the rest of the continent. In comparison with the UK, Germany and even the US, France’s inflation rate, at 6.5%, is considerably lower.</p> <p>Another measure Macron has taken to stabilise the situation is to renationalise EDF, France’s main electricity supplier, at a cost of nearly €10bn. The government has also reduced taxes on electricity and approved a €20bn package of measures to help struggling households cope with rising energy and food prices.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>US</strong></p> <p>It’s not just Europe dealing with this debilitating problem. The US is contending with the worst energy crisis since the 1970s. Last month, gasoline prices reached $5 a gallon for the first time ever, natural gas hit its highest mark in 14 years and electricity grid operators announced controlled outages are likely.</p> <p>In response, Senator Joe Manchin is backing a $369bn climate and energy deal. The legislation would include tax credits for buying environmentally friendly vehicles, incentives to accelerate the rollout of wind and solar farms, and support for nuclear power production. However, for this legislation to have any impact on the current crisis, it would have to be rolled out quickly and efficiently – which in the context of the US’s political gridlock is unlikely. <br></p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong></p> <p>Japan is no stranger to an energy crisis. After the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in 2011 that triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, energy saving became a cornerstone national project for the country. So, unlike in many other countries, Japan already has a blueprint for how to deal with this kind of crisis.</p> <p>Instead of large, governmental interventions, the focus seems to be on individuals cutting back. The government has long encouraged businesses and households to lower their use of air conditioners and avoid using other power-hungry appliances. The suspension of nuclear power for the last decade has made problems worse – as the crisis continues, it’s clear Japan is going to have to reevaluate the way it generates energy.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p> <p>For Pakistan, a country that depends on imported fuel, the global energy crisis has left its economy in a dire place. Power cuts have significantly affected commercial activity, and gas rationing to the textile industry, a vital part of Pakistan’s economy, has resulted in a loss of $1bn in export orders.</p> <p>To deal with this, Pakistan has announced that it is open to long-term contracts of up to 30 years – most likely with Qatar and the UAE. Long-term contracts however are reportedly 75% more expensive than they were a year ago. Experts estimate that if Pakistan signed a deal now, a single cargo could cost roughly $55m-$61m. Pakistan is also looking inward and, like many other countries, turning to its nuclear plants to alleviate some of the pressure. Whether this will be enough is unclear.</p> <h2>We want to hear from you</h2> <p>Do you plan to protest rising energy bills?</p> <p><em>Reply to this email to let us know or email <a href=\"mailto:first.edition@theguardian.com\">first.edition@theguardian.com</a></em></p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>I have recommended the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/telephone-game-with-alex-and-justin/id1597761181?i=1000575605240\">Normal Gossip podcast </a>in this newsletter before, but I must recommend it once again.

At 60 a man living in the most deprived 10% of the country typically has the burden of ill-health experienced by a counterpart in the wealthiest 10% at the age of 70.</p> <p>The thinktank’s analysis of NHS data also shows that women in England’s poorest places are diagnosed with a long-term illness at the age of 40 on average, whereas that does not happen to those in the most prosperous places until 48.</p> <p>Impoverished women spend 43.6 years, or 52% of their lifespan, beset by diagnosed illness, while for their best-off peers it is 41 years, or 46% of their life cycle.</p> <p>In addition, women from the most deprived backgrounds die on average at 83.6 years old, more than five years sooner than the 88.8-year life expectancy of well-off women.</p> <p>Likewise, the poorest men are expected to spend 42.7 years free of disease, whereas it is much longer among the best-off 10% of the population – 49.2 years. And their life expectancy is 78.3 years, compared with 87.1 for the richest.</p> <p>The findings underline Britain’s wide and entrenched socio-economic inequalities in health, which the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted. Ministers have promised to make tackling them a priority as part of the commitment to levelling up, but a promised white paper on that has been delayed.</p> <p>Researchers led by Toby Watt said their findings were likely to be the most accurate published so far because they were based on data detailing patients’ interactions with primary care and hospital services, and unlike previous studies did not rely on people’s self-reported health.</p> <p>“In human terms, these stark disparities show that at the age of 40, the average woman living in the poorest areas in England is already being treated for her first long-term illness. This condition means discomfort, a worse quality of life and additional visits to the GP, medication or hospital, depending on what it is. At the other end of the spectrum, the average 40-year-old woman will live a further eight years – about 10% of her life – without diminished quality of life through illness,” Watt said.</p> <p>“Throughout the rest of her life the impoverished 40-year-old is more likely to have breathing difficulties from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, experience alcohol problems, chronic pain, anxiety, depression, and suffer a heart attack or stroke at younger ages. If she makes it to 80, which is less likely, she will still be receiving treatment for and living with more severe illness than her wealthier counterparts.”</p> <p>He and his team found that inequalities in the burden of disease start in childhood and persist and change in nature through adulthood into older age. However, they are largely explicable over the life cycle by just a handful of illnesses: chronic pain, diabetes, severe breathing problems, anxiety, depression, strokes, heart attacks and drink-related problems.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-hidden-costs-of-covid-19-the-social-backlog)\">speech last year</a>, Sajid Javid, then health secretary, identified “the disease of disparity” as a major cause of preventable death and promised to address its underlying causes.</p> <p>Watt urged whichever of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak becomes the next prime minister to treat health inequalities as a top priority. Doing so would involve focusing on “good quality jobs, housing and education” and not simply more action by the NHS, he added.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The pandemic shone a light on the stark health inequalities that exist across the country – we are committed to levelling up the health of the nation so that everyone can live longer, healthier lives, regardless of their background. </p> <p>“We have set up the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities to drive progress in improving health and reduce these unacceptable disparities, focusing on the places and communities where ill health is most prevalent.</p> <p>“We are aware women live on average for longer than men but spend more of their life in poor health, which is why we published the women’s health strategy on 20 July 2022 to work towards closing the gender health gap.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/15/discovered-in-the-deep-hairy-chested-hoff-crab","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Discovered in the deep: the mini cities of hairy-chested Hoff crabs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/15/discovered-in-the-deep-hairy-chested-hoff-crab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/15/discovered-in-the-deep-hairy-chested-hoff-crab","fields":{"headline":"Discovered in the deep: the mini cities of hairy-chested Hoff crabs","trailText":"Discovered 2,500 metres deep, and named after former Baywatch star David Hasselhoff, these crabs live in one of the Earth’s most extreme habitats","byline":"Helen Scales","body":"<p>In 2005, scientists exploring more than a mile underwater south of Easter Island in the south Pacific, found odd-looking white crabs with long, hairy arms.

Instead, they graze on colonies of microbes that grow within their fur. These microbes harness energy from toxic chemicals, such as methane and hydrogen sulphide, that are churned out of the vent chimney stacks.</p> \n<p>The microbial process known as chemosynthesis is a dark alternative to plant-based photosynthesis and it goes on in the pitch black of the deep sea with no need for sunlight. “The adaptability of life is astounding,” says Roterman.</p> \n<p>A few years ago, when asked by a journalist which of his natural history curiosities he treasures the most, David Attenborough said he was especially fond of the Hoff crab encased in resin, like a paperweight, that sits on his desk.

There can be more than 700 Hoff crabs per square metre, with the males tussling for prime real estate, vying to get nearest to the chemical-rich fluids that bathe their microbes and yield more food. </p> \n<p>They form mini cities under the sea, co-existing in a tiny area where it’s warm enough to live but not hot enough to boil.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/03/discovered-in-the-deep-the-snail-with-iron-armour\">Discovered in the deep: the snail with iron armour</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Life for female Hoff crabs is quite different. With clutches of fertilised eggs stuck on to their bodies they cannot afford to hang around the vents where the seawater is low in oxygen and their young would soon suffocate. So expectant females crawl away into the cold dark a few metres from the chimneys. There they sit and starve, lacking chemicals to nourish their microbial fur farm.</p> \n<p>They become paralysed by the cold water and are easy prey for predators. “We found these weird seven-armed starfish that would patrol the perimeter and eat the females,” says Roterman.</p> \n<p>One of the many mysteries that still surrounds Hoff crabs is whether females breed just once then die, or if they make it back to the vent chimneys to find another mate. “We have no idea if it’s a one-way trip,” he says.</p> \n<p>The low oxygen around hydrothermal vents could put yeti and Hoff crabs at particular risk of the climate crisis. The warming ocean is likely to become more stratified and stagnant, with less mixing of oxygen-rich shallow seawater down into the deep.</p> \n<p>“We know this is happening already,” Roterman says, “and it means that some of the first deep-sea species that could go extinct … could be hydrothermal vent species.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/15/cassie-and-the-lights-review-underbelly-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Cassie and the Lights review – family drama glows in the darkness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/15/cassie-and-the-lights-review-underbelly-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/15/cassie-and-the-lights-review-underbelly-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Cassie and the Lights review – family drama glows in the darkness","trailText":"Alex Howarth’s hugely moving play has plenty of humour and a homemade aesthetic, while asking tough questions about parenting and the law","byline":"Chris Wiegand","body":"<p>When Cassie and her younger sisters are on a family bowling trip, their mum goes to buy slushies and disappears.

Kit, the youngest, focuses on the presents Mum might bring back from her “holiday”; Cassie sidelines her teenage dreams and shifts straight into multitasking middle age.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f74fd1baebd55e44b18354216df2b14cd5cc6a13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f74fd1baebd55e44b18354216df2b14cd5cc6a13/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cassie and the Lights is designed and directed by playwright Alex Howarth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cassie and the Lights is designed and directed by playwright Alex Howarth. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The adult characters are either heard in voiceover (for social workers and foster carers Mark and Alice) or, most powerfully, represented by the audience (when Cassie makes the case to us that she should become her sisters’ legal guardian). We are directly asked for our own notions of what makes a family. Mark and Alice are kind even if their house doesn’t smell like the girls’ own; Cassie knows her sisters inside out but is it fair on her that she should take full responsibility for them? Repeatedly, the play asks: what is enough for one person? And what is too much?</p> <p>This difficult material, taken from true stories, is handled with off-centre humour. Mark “thinks Ariana Grande is something you get at Starbucks”; Kit lets an audience member wear her frog hat during an upsetting scene. Ellie and Imogen Mason’s electronic music, played live, heightens the lighting design by Rachel Sampley. A constellation of sources capture the glow of sisterly support while also (at one point literally) catching them in the headlights.</p> <p>The script’s potent metaphor of the trinary star system could afford not to be repeated at the end but this is a thoughtful, warm, hugely moving hour that will leave you wanting to call whomever it is you think of as family.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/cassie-and-the-lights\">Underbelly, Edinburgh</a>, until 28 August.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2022\">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:00:30Z","webTitle":"Wind, hydrogen, no demolitions: how next PM can put UK on net zero path","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/15/wind-hydrogen-no-demolitions-how-next-pm-can-put-uk-on-net-zero-path","fields":{"headline":"Wind, hydrogen, no demolitions: how next PM can put UK on net zero path","trailText":"Boris Johnson’s plans are behind schedule and the CBI says Britain is falling behind Europe and the US","byline":"Phillip Inman and Alex Lawson","body":"<p>There is little mention of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution\">Boris Johnson’s “green industrial revolution”</a> on the campaign trail of the two Conservative party leadership candidates.</p> <p>Maybe it’s not surprising when Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are focused on formulating plans to deal with the more immediate energy crisis. That said, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are pressing ahead with announcing the investments they would make to achieve net zero by 2050.</p> <p>A new prime minister could do worse than crack on with some of the plans in Johnson’s 10-point programme, announced to great fanfare in 2020. The plans are behind schedule and several of the ideas are considered by experts to be dead ends.</p> <p>The CBI has accused the government of relying too heavily on private-sector investment, which it blames for Britain falling behind Europe and the US. The Biden administration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/inflation-reduction-act-senate-democrats-pass\">poised to pass a near $370bn bill</a> to promote climate-friendly infrastructure. Johnson’s 10-point plan committed the government to spending £12bn. The government’s own adviser, the Climate Change Committee, said the money on offer needed to be closer to £50bn to make a difference.</p> <p>Nevertheless, piecing together the ideas and investment needed to create a zero-carbon economy is achievable and could create more sustainable jobs, if the new regime can decide what it wants to do.</p> <h2>Offshore wind</h2> <p>The offshore wind industry has put the UK in the front rank of countries managing the switch away from fossil fuels. More arrays in the sea are planned on the east and west coast.</p> <p>Official figures show that meeting net zero targets would mean cutting gas use by 65% by 2035, and almost 100% by 2050. At the moment gas accounts for about 90% of home heating and 40% of electricity generation. At 37%, heating accounts for the largest proportion of UK greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Kwasi Kwarteng, a chief ally of Truss’s, said this year he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/13/tories-plan-big-expansion-of-wind-farms-to-protect-national-security\">would expand onshore wind</a>, helping speed up the transition. While the UK has only limited capacity to make wind turbines, and the number of jobs created by businesses servicing windfarms is small in relation to the size of the investment, the employment is highly skilled and expert firms could export their knowhow.</p> <p>Sunak said at a recent hustings that regulations governing offshore wind, rooftop solar and nuclear would be overhauled to scale up supply, despite the critics arguing that solar is held back by a lack of power storage facilities and all renewables are at the mercy of an electricity grid in desperate need of an upgrade to cope with a coal, oil and gas-free world.</p> <h2>Low-carbon hydrogen</h2> <p>The UK’s ambition for hydrogen production was recently doubled to 10 gigawatts by 2030. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/03/green-hydrogen-from-renewables-could-become-cheapest-transformative-fuel-within-a-decade\">Green hydrogen</a> is produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The gas is burned to produce power, emitting only water vapour and warm air, and no carbon greenhouse gases. A favourite of the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, hydrogen is also seen as the green fuel of the future by the car company Toyota and the Spanish energy firm Iberdrola, which owns Europe’s largest production site for green hydrogen for industrial use, at Puertollano in Spain.</p> <p>Iberdrola’s subsidiary Scottish Power plans to use government subsidies to build a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/08/scottishpower-build-150m-green-hydrogen-plant-port-felixstowe\">100 megawatt plant at Felixstowe</a> to provide enough fuel to power 1,300 hydrogen trucks operating inside the port from 2026. Hydrogen cells could take over from diesel to power trucks, farm equipment and diggers, but there would need to be significant funding to create a UK industry.</p> <h2>Nuclear power</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4fd5ea04f02b9ca4e0636d9c3c39ab391c10a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b4fd5ea04f02b9ca4e0636d9c3c39ab391c10a0/0_410_8061_4836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Construction work at Hinkley Point C\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Construction work at Hinkley Point C.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a new power station taking shape at Hinkley Point in Somerset and the government has approved another at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-government-gives-go-ahead-to-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plant\">the Sizewell site in Suffolk</a> at an expected cost of £20bn. Both will be built by the French electricity company EDF.</p> <p>The Sizewell C site could be challenged if local people pursue an appeal over the next few weeks. The CBI boss, Tony Danker, has urged the government to push on with the investment, and Sunak has promised to go ahead should he become leader, presumably whatever challenges lie ahead.</p> <p>Delays and cost overruns are likely and could help Rolls-Royce, which expects to have a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/rolls-royce-expecting-uk-approval-for-small-nuclear-reactors-by-mid-2024\">mini-nuclear power stations</a> ready by the end of the decade, though these have faced their own time and cost overruns.</p> <h2>Zero-emission vehicles</h2> <p>Britain spends about £27bn on new roads but very little on subsidising electric car production or the infrastructure of charging points that supports electric vehicles.</p> <p>Car firms, almost all of them foreign-owned, have complained that subsidies for UK production are small. Car parts suppliers have little incentive to adapt to electric cars. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/12/huge-uk-electric-car-battery-factory-on-life-support-to-cut-costs\">battery maker BritishVolt</a> is on “life support” as it wrestles with funding problems.</p> <h2>Green public transport, cycling and walking</h2> <p>Public transport is becoming green as electric buses become more popular. Electric cycles and scooters are being adopted at a rapid pace in some towns and cities. Cars are being forced to lower their speed in built-up areas. But pedestrians are being left out of schemes to create more livable cities, persuading families to stick with the suburbs and new housing estates that rely on private car travel.</p> <p>More investment in electric-powered trains would create jobs and make links across the railway network more reliable. There are plans to electrify the Midland mainline and the Transpennine route and upgrade the east coast mainline, but with HS2 likely to be stopped at Manchester, the spur to Leeds abandoned and HS3 across the northern cities scrapped, the opportunities to revive the push for electrification are many.</p> <p>The payback from integrating cycling, walking and public transport will be significant, as the Netherlands and Denmark have found.</p> <h2>Greener buildings</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39caae7c0da833b6d51f8267532c03a0615eb311\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39caae7c0da833b6d51f8267532c03a0615eb311/0_104_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heat loss from a property, seen through an infra-red camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heat loss from a property, seen through an infra-red camera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A building with solid walls built before the second world war costs about £20,000 to insulate and between £10,000 and £20,000 for a heat pump. There are about 8m of these homes.</p> <p>Even the best-insulated homes gain a category B certificate when an A is needed to meet zero carbon targets. It means even those built or refurbished in the last 30 years will need another facelift.</p> <p>And before embarking on this investment, ministers must stop developers checking their own homework. There are concerns that builders are cutting corners knowing local authorities lack the staff to check on them.</p> <p>Sunak or Truss could also put a moratorium on the demolition of existing commercial and residential buildings. The UK would put itself at the forefront of a global construction industry that focuses on refurbishing existing structures to make them low-carbon. Most architects and developers remain attached to the idea of constructing new buildings, but western countries have most of what they need if the current stock is upgraded and empty homes are brought back into use.</p> <h2>Natural environment</h2> <p>Protecting nature has obvious benefits. Sunak commissioned a 360-page report from the eminent Cambridge economist Partha Dasgupta detailing how the economy will suffer unless we protect the natural environment, but didn’t say what action he would take.</p> <p>Chancellors always delay taking action because while they understand investments create jobs and save the exchequer money in the future from flooding and drought, it is less clear how it creates businesses that generate tax income or export cash.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 18 August 2022. An earlier version said that no greenhouse gases are emitted when green hydrogen is burned; that meant to refer to carbon greenhouse gases. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/aug/15/hosepipe-bans-saturn-and-sexting-edith-pritchetts-week-in-venn-diagrams-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:00:29Z","webTitle":"Hosepipe bans, Saturn and sexting: Edith Pritchett’s week in Venn diagrams – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/aug/15/hosepipe-bans-saturn-and-sexting-edith-pritchetts-week-in-venn-diagrams-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/aug/15/hosepipe-bans-saturn-and-sexting-edith-pritchetts-week-in-venn-diagrams-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Hosepipe bans, Saturn and sexting: Edith Pritchett’s week in Venn diagrams – cartoon","trailText":"Saying whatever crap will get you in there …","byline":"Edith Pritchett","body":"<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/03/comics-master-2016/embed/embed.html?srcs-mobile=https://media.guim.co.uk/769cf98d37fcdfd0c35b1791f1bbac77265b3e51/0_0_800_544/500.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/af78a8efa967dfdb9db0c7892b0eb9cc5f8b8a15/0_0_800_547/500.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/52f8fd2aed93dcca4e23116d88faeeb46b29fb4a/0_0_800_544/500.jpg&amp;ratios-mobile=67.85714285714286+68.57142857142857+67.85714285714286&amp;srcs-desktop=https://media.guim.co.uk/53d0b695eaaade6aaba319236e4eeadc82ed31e1/0_0_5976_1346/2000.jpg&amp;ratios-desktop=22.857142857142858&amp;credit=Comic%20by%20Edith%20Pritchett/The%20Guardian&amp;background=FFFFFF&amp;vpadding=20\" data-alt=\"Gardens during the hosepipe ban, sexting and Saturn: Edith Pritchett's week in Venn diagrams – cartoon\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/03/comics-master-2016/embed/embed.html?srcs-mobile=https://media.guim.co.uk/769cf98d37fcdfd0c35b1791f1bbac77265b3e51/0_0_800_544/500.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/af78a8efa967dfdb9db0c7892b0eb9cc5f8b8a15/0_0_800_547/500.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/52f8fd2aed93dcca4e23116d88faeeb46b29fb4a/0_0_800_544/500.jpg&ratios-mobile=67.85714285714286+68.57142857142857+67.85714285714286&srcs-desktop=https://media.guim.co.uk/53d0b695eaaade6aaba319236e4eeadc82ed31e1/0_0_5976_1346/2000.jpg&ratios-desktop=22.857142857142858&credit=Comic%20by%20Edith%20Pritchett/The%20Guardian&background=FFFFFF&vpadding=20\">Gardens during the hosepipe ban, sexting and Saturn: Edith Pritchett's week in Venn diagrams – cartoon</a> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/15/mvrdv-albania-tirana-skanderbeg-skyscraper-marble-arch-mound","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:00:29Z","webTitle":"What the Marble Arch Mound architects did next: a skyscraper shaped like Albania’s national hero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/15/mvrdv-albania-tirana-skanderbeg-skyscraper-marble-arch-mound","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/15/mvrdv-albania-tirana-skanderbeg-skyscraper-marble-arch-mound","fields":{"headline":"What the Marble Arch Mound architects did next: a skyscraper shaped like Albania’s national hero","trailText":"A building with the aquiline profile of a 15th-century warrior is the latest proposal by MVRDV to transform Tirana, the capital of Albania.

The 7ft warrior king known as the Dragon of Albania, slayer of the Ottoman Turks, is celebrated in numerous monuments and reliefs, his imposing stature and fiery eyes keeping watch over the territory he fought for in the 15th century.</p> <p>Now his face will loom larger over the capital than ever before. Construction has begun on an 85-metre-high block of apartments, offices and shops in the centre of Tirana, designed in <a href=\"https://www.mvrdv.nl/news/4204/mvrdv-skanderbeg-building-statue-albania-national-hero\">the shape of Skanderbeg’s head</a>. Images of the project depict an amorphous white tower ringed with balconies that ripple in and out to form a lumpy approximation of the hero’s features, imprinting his profile permanently on the skyline in concrete and glass. Wealthy future residents will be able to look out from the warrior’s eyes, hang out on his ears or dine alfresco on the end of his nose – from which greenery will dangle in an unfortunate snot-like drip.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is nationalism good or bad?

Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jul/23/marble-arch-hill-mound-london-oxford-street\">disastrous Marble Arch Mound</a> in London, which arguably <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/politics/tories-westminster-marble-arch-mound\">cost the Conservative council its leadership of the local borough</a>, was merely the latest in a long line of cartoonish creations that seem to have been plucked from the depths of a joke shop bargain bin.

Topping out last year, its 140-metre concrete frame makes it the tallest building in the city, and it continues the pop-nationalist theme. Rather than a face, this hefty slab of luxury flats and offices features a pixelated map of Albania protruding from its facade – although the form is so indistinct, it looks more like the concrete formwork slipped on the way up, leaving a wonky mess in its wake. The dramatically carved volumes imagined by MVRDV appear to have been value-engineered into more shallow dimples, giving the impression that the building is prematurely eroding.</p> <p>“These days, cities around the world increasingly look like each other,” says Winy Maas, founding partner of the Dutch architecture firm. “I always encourage them to resist this, to find their individual character and emphasise it. Tirana has the opportunity of a blank canvas for high-density structures. It can be progressive in that sense and build up character and a sense of place.”</p> <p>But many local residents aren’t so sure about the sense of place being created by Maas, and the roster of other international architects who have been flown in to reshape the city. A handful of towers are rising around Tirana’s central Skanderbeg Square, with four already complete and at least another six in the pipeline. There have been vocal <a href=\"https://ba.boell.org/en/2021/02/11/tirana-2020-kein-erinnern-kein-diskurs\">protests against the destruction of Ottoman-era villas</a> to make way for the slew of high-rise developments, with critics bemoaning the loss of heritage and rocketing property prices, and accusations that the projects are being used as money laundering schemes for organised crime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50de342aef976d78a600a9e5d14dcd2d2b5fd3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50de342aef976d78a600a9e5d14dcd2d2b5fd3c0/171_42_1042_625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Value engineered … Downtown One under construction, with its relief map greatly reduced.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Value engineered … Downtown One under construction, with its relief map dramatically reduced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Idit Riza/© MVRDV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://exit.al/en/2020/05/25/more-old-tirana-villas-demolished-to-make-space-for-new-high-rise-building-by-skanderbeg-square/\">Two historic villas were demolished</a> to make way for the Skanderbeg tower in May 2020, when the city was in pandemic lockdown. At the same time, the city’s cherished National Theatre, dating from the 1930s, was also bulldozed to make way for a project by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-albania-theatre-idUSKBN22T0FV\">to widespread condemnation</a>.</p> <p>“The future of Tirana will be full of ghost skyscrapers,” says Vincent WJ van Gerven Oei, a Dutch writer who has lived in Tirana for the last 12 years and closely tracked the city’s development. “I love MVRDV – the things they build in the Netherlands are among my favourite buildings – but then they come to Albania and become lousy assholes. They think they can get away with crappy design, checking off all the stupid nationalist tropes you can think of.”<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBLbIH3wYkU\">In a 2018 lecture</a>, when the two towers were in development, Maas addressed the overt nationalist symbolism of designing a building in the shape of the country’s map. “I had a discussion with some of the European politicians about that,” he said. “Because, can you do that? Is nationalism good or bad? But Albania needs it, to show it’s sexy and that it’s actually quite cool.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"22f0911816a94a26a95eb3856f5dafde5186ed8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22f0911816a94a26a95eb3856f5dafde5186ed8f/0_0_3000_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The original vision for the Toptani shopping centre …\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The original vision for the Toptani shopping centre …</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © MVRDV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dashing back and forth on stage, speaking like a hyperactive child who had consumed too many E-numbers, Maas rhapsodised his love affair with Albania.

In one wiretap, two of those arrested were heard discussing a building constructor in Albania who held three building permits for buildings worth €180m, but had only €10m to hand. “The new skyscrapers are to be sold for €3,000-4,000 per square metre,” one of the suspects says. “And do you know how much it cost to build? €510.” MVRDV says that, in accordance with Dutch law, it runs background checks on its clients using a third-party company that scans for criminal activity, among other things, and there is no suggestion of illegal funds. A spokesperson for the city of Tirana said: “The duty of the municipality is to ensure that construction plans, aesthetics, architecture rules and mobility plans are respected. We understand we live in a toxic political environment in the Balkans and have repeatedly asked opposition leaders to point out: which one of these towers is suspect of such [criminal] activity? To date, we have no response and there has been no official claim with the Tirana prosecution.”</p> <p>The radical reshaping of the Albanian capital over the last two decades can primarily be credited to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/10/edi-rama-albania-pm-escape-curse-of-history\">Edi Rama</a>, who served as its mayor from 2000-2011 and has been the country’s prime minister since 2013. Rama was a professional basketball player and artist in the 1990s, and Maas says in his lecture: “I know Edi from Paris, when he was a painter”. Rama returned to Albania to become minister of culture in 1998, and embarked on a radical clean-up operation when he became mayor. He made headlines with his policies of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/15/meet-edi-rama-albanias-artist-prime-minister-exhibition\">painting grey soviet buildings in bright colours </a>to liven up the city, planting trees, creating bike lanes and holding international architectural competitions – reforms that landed him <a href=\"http://www.worldmayor.com/worldmayor_2004/results_2004.html\">the inaugural World Mayor prize</a> in 2004.<br><br>One of the first projects MVRDV scooped under Rama’s reign was the <a href=\"https://www.mvrdv.com/projects/100/toptani-shopping\">Toptani shopping centre</a> in 2005, which was conceived as a hollowed out pixelated mass covered in giant LCD advertising screens. Having won the competition, Maas heard nothing until a few years later, when he realised the building had in fact been built by other architects, and <a href=\"https://exit.al/en/2018/07/03/another-white-male-architect-drank-ramas-cool-aid/\">drastically watered down in the process</a>. The digital facade was exchanged for standard grey cladding panels, while his vision for an open arcade became a generic closed-off mall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"babc2fdc4e1d0e0f07437de4260e18698a376a5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/babc2fdc4e1d0e0f07437de4260e18698a376a5e/0_96_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unrealised project … MVRDV’s proposal for Tirana Rocks, an apartment complex by Tirana Lake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unrealised project … MVRDV’s proposal for Tirana Rocks, an apartment complex by Tirana Lake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © MVRDV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Projects here are often realised in a totally different way to how the architects originally intended,” says Van Gerven Oei. “There’s the reality of the digital render, always beautiful, brilliant and groundbreaking, and then the reality of Albanian construction companies, who want to do the easiest, fastest thing at the lowest possible price.”</p> <p>Not to be dissuaded by the Frankenstein mall, MVRDV continued to seek work in Albania. Several unrealised projects followed, from a colossal pile of oblong apartment blocks planned for a lakeside site in 2008, dubbed <a href=\"https://www.mvrdv.nl/projects/103/tirana-rocks\">Tirana Rocks</a>, to a coastal resort for a Russian client designed as an artificial hillside that would glow eerily at night – “better than any James Bond movie,” Maas promised. He explains how Downtown One began as a three-dimensional Albania-shaped building, but proved too expensive, so they decided to imprint the shape of the map on a simple rectangular tower instead. A further commission came in 2018 to transform the striking marble-clad <a href=\"https://www.architectural-review.com/essays/outrage/outrage-the-unwilding-of-the-pyramid-of-tirana\">Pyramid of Tirana</a> – built in the 1980s as a museum to celebrate the country’s former communist dictator – which had become a popular place for the city’s youth to scramble up and slide down. <a href=\"https://exit.al/en/2019/04/25/mvrdv-and-the-propaganda-of-transparency/\">MVRDV were appointed</a>, without a public competition, to transform it into a tech hub – smothering the sloping sides with concrete steps in the process. Finally, when it comes to the Skanderbeg tower, the origins are as blunt as you might expect. As Maas recalls: “Then Edi said: ‘I want to do something with history.’” And so the giant head was born.<br><br>Local people have joked that, as Rama cultivates an elder-statesman look – his 6ft 6in frame and growing beard giving him an increasingly Skanderbeg-esque appearance – the head-shaped building may end up looking more like a lasting monument to the artist-politician who reshaped the capital, forever gazing out over his vision of empty towers.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/i-was-very-shaky-when-i-started-acting-hannah-einbinder-on-hacks-standup-and-sexual-identity","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:00:29Z","webTitle":"‘I was very shaky when I started acting’: Hannah Einbinder on Hacks, standup and sexual identity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/i-was-very-shaky-when-i-started-acting-hannah-einbinder-on-hacks-standup-and-sexual-identity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/i-was-very-shaky-when-i-started-acting-hannah-einbinder-on-hacks-standup-and-sexual-identity","fields":{"headline":"‘I was very shaky when I started acting’: Hannah Einbinder on Hacks, standup and sexual identity","trailText":"After building a career in comedy, the 27-year-old landed her first screen role in the series about the relationship between two female comics.

As well as performing her own standup comedy (she’s on tour in the US when we speak, with a stint in London on the horizon), the 27-year-old stars in a series that revolves around it. Hacks centres on the unlikely bond between Ava – a down-on-her-luck, entitled millennial comedy writer – and Deborah (TV veteran Jean Smart), an equally down-on-her-luck, Joan Rivers-esque comic inching closer towards retirement with every hokey gag she performs on stage in Las Vegas. Together, this oddest of odd couples attempt to revamp Deborah’s tired image from QVC saleswoman back to comedian, while interrogating the misogyny and double standards that have underpinned her career. Of course, it wouldn’t be as moreishly watchable – and critically acclaimed – as it is if there weren’t several bumps in the road, from ill-advised email exchanges to human ashes being accidentally thrown in the bin.</p> <p>The series has recently been renewed for a third season, and been nominated for a glut of Emmys (17 this year alone, including a second supporting actress nod for Einbinder), with critics praising its complex, complicated women. And, like all the best comedy about comedy – from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/30-rock\">30 Rock</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/31/bojack-horseman-review\">BoJack Horseman</a> – Hacks shows the dizzy highs and wretched lows of making other people laugh. “These characters take two step forwards and one step back,” says Einbinder. “They’re two flawed people, which only drives the plot forward … Ava is growing rapidly as a human being and having to learn a lot of tough lessons via Deborah.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"99ea5363a2765363ac5989b42e79d046b72b7fe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99ea5363a2765363ac5989b42e79d046b72b7fe3/0_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Einbinder at the Ice House comedy club in Pasadena, LA, in 2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah at the Ice House comedy club in Pasadena, LA, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael S Schwartz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I speak to Einbinder, she’s standing outside her home in Los Angeles, plumbing issues having temporarily relegated her to the garden. She’s softly spoken and wry, and far less highly strung than anyone who has seen the series might expect (she has previously quipped that the only traits she shares with Ava are “cystic acne, red hair and no upper body strength”). She pulls her Wayfarers up now and again to make eye contact, although the mid-morning sun bounces off her phone camera.</p> <p>The daughter of the original Saturday Night Live cast member Laraine Newman and her former husband, the actor Chad Einbinder, she had what she describes as the “incredible privilege” of being raised in LA. While humour was an important part of family life (“everybody in my family shares the various multiple insecurities that makes a person need laughter – need to be validated through laughter”, she says), the entertainment industry was more of a background hum than something she focused on. Instead, inspired by news pundits such as Rachel Maddow, Einbinder studied journalism at California’s Chapman University. “I was on a <em>lot</em> of [the attention-deficit drug] Adderall. And I would read the newspaper cover to cover,” she says. “I had gone to high school around the time of Barack Obama’s presidency, and it was a very exciting time here. I was full of hope.” Now, unsurprisingly, it all feels like “a lifetime ago. Another planet!”</p> <p>Halfway through college, Einbinder stumbled into performance. She had stopped taking Adderall, which had also made her feel inhibited and “mildly sedated”, and started taking her material to open mic nights. Of the clips still available online, skits about Osama bin Laden (is he actually … attractive?) and parodies of 30s film noir stand out, Einbinder’s polite veneer giving way to increasingly oddball character comedy.<strong> </strong>“I enjoy sprinkling character work through a set where my voice is naturally low and monotone,” she says. “It’s my way of breaking the ‘me’ up for a viewer who is like me and maybe needs a little extra stimulation.”</p> <p>Naturally self-deprecating, with a self-professed tendency to bat away compliments, she guesstimates that 90% of her gags didn’t land in those early performances. Even so, she plugged along, sometimes doing three gigs in one night in the early days while working as a barista by day. “I had such a hunger for [performing] and I romanticised that – there’s a lot of romanticisation of pain in standup, especially among young comedians. And obviously the capitalist machine fosters that …” She pauses. “You could call it work ethic, but it’s really just a survival tactic.” Breaking through is, she says, “right place, right time. A lot of things need to align.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd9ab71cfad5aebb5c548ee0f4c22926d8f203c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd9ab71cfad5aebb5c548ee0f4c22926d8f203c9/0_7_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Einbinder and Lorenza Izzo in Hacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It’s been such an affirming thing for me as a queer person to see this experience reflected’ … Hannah Einbinder and Lorenza Izzo in Hacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things did indeed start to align in 2020. Einbinder made her television debut as the youngest comic to have performed on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show and she then landed the part in Hacks. It was her first acting role, and one that many other professional actors had auditioned for, but it didn’t go to Einbinder’s head. “I was very shaky when I first started acting,” she says. “I had no barometer of whether or not I was doing well. My barometer used to be whether or not people were laughing, and then when you’re acting, they’re recording sound, so everyone has to be quiet. That was a bit of a mindfuck. It went against everything every instinct that is wired within me, but I’m starting to finally believe that I’m doing a good job.”</p> <p>Einbinder does more than merely a good job in Hacks, as she conveys the peaks and troughs of Ava’s existence. She embodies the pain of becoming persona non grata in her industry (for tweeting a joke about a rightwing senator) and the joy of steering Deborah away from trite one-liners to something more substantive. In season one, the process of cataloguing Deborah’s archive leads Ava to better understand her boss, and see her as a trailblazer rather than a has-been – and a hack. Their relationship is often – at least at first – based on barbs and put-downs, but there is also something pure about it, cutting across seemingly entrenched generational divides. After all, Einbinder explains, it’s not as if it’s as simple as young comics being on the right side of history compared with their older counterparts.</p> <p>“I know a ton of comedians who are in their 50s or up who are still really good – their quality hasn’t waned as a result of their age, because they’re intelligent, and they understand the intent of their jokes. In some cases, people get older, and they become the old man or woman yelling at the new generation. And that absolutely happens. But I think you are either devoted to an interesting take – and one that doesn’t punch down – or you’re not. I know people who are incredibly young, who are ignorant and offensive and bigoted, and use standup as a vehicle for that bigotry.”</p> <p>Watching the show, the quasi-mother/daughter relationship between the leads (Smart is 70, the same age as Einbinder’s actual mother) fizzes with the kind of chemistry that can surely only be rooted in real life. “Our actual relationship has only positively affected our on-screen one, and you know … I really love her,” says Einbinder. “I don’t have to go anywhere else [to portray those emotions]. When things are heartbreaking, it’s easier to imagine because of the depth and importance of my relationship with her.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’ve had to perform to utter darkness, when they turn the lights on you and you can’t see a single face in the crowd. It’s terrible</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Little, you might imagine, could be as heartbreaking as filming a funeral scene together not long after the death of Smart’s husband, Richard Gilliland. “Jean is the toughest,” says Einbinder. “She really put the crew and the cast and the production first, and thinks nothing of it. She pushed through for as long as we needed to finish the shoot, so that she could then go in and take her time. But I mean, watching her that week was,” Einbinder takes a long pause, sounding emotional. “She’s just really incredible, and very strong”.</p> <p>As well as being funny and touching and sometimes downright silly (not least when Ava and Deborah bond over weed edibles while the latter recovers from plastic surgery),<strong> </strong>Hacks has gained acclaim for its rounded cast of queer characters. These include the perennially put-upon business manager, Marcus (Carl Clemons-Hopkins), who is trying to run his own life and Deborah’s, and Ava herself, who – like Einbinder – is bisexual, and schools Deborah about the need for nuance when it comes to sexual identity. “I think there are only a handful of shows that have even attempted to portray bisexuals as being humans worthy of love, and humans whose identities are seen as valid and accepted,” says Einbinder. “It is a dream as a queer person to be able to be a part of that representation that I’d loved to have seen growing up. It’s been such an affirming thing for me as a queer person to see this experience reflected … I could not have thought of a better gig. When I got the audition, I thought, I’m not going to get this, but I can’t wait to watch it – I just really love it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93fae1b6578451d0467926a9afeab9cccb2f82a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93fae1b6578451d0467926a9afeab9cccb2f82a2/0_536_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder in Hacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder in Hacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Ballard/HBO Max</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite starring in a show that often shows the total horror of standup, and where a bad set can truly make Einbinder’s – and the audience’s – skin crawl, you get the sense that it has only made her fall further in love with live performance.</p> <p>“I love an intimate crowd,” she says. “I’ve had to perform to utter darkness, when they turn the lights on you and you can’t see a single face in the crowd – it’s terrible. I find that unless I can see the whites of people’s eyes, I don’t really feel like I’m doing the thing.”</p> <p>While Deborah’s trip to the cruise ship eventually devolves into a back and forth of heckling and offence, Einbinder happily tends to have an easier ride on stage. “Since Hacks, a lot of people just yell out nice things,” she says. Despite her self-effacing tendencies, as she heads off to call the plumber Einbinder sounds proud of herself – and maybe just a little relieved.</p> <p><em>Hacks is available on Amazon Prime Video in the UK</em><em>, </em><em>HBO Max in the US</em><em> and </em><em>Stan in Australia</em><em>. </em><em>Hannah Einbinder is at <a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/shows/hannah-einbinder/\">Soho Theatre</a>, London, from 26 September to 8 October</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/new-zealand-covid-cases-at-six-month-low-in-sign-winter-wave-is-easing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T04:37:42Z","webTitle":"New Zealand Covid cases at six-month low in sign winter wave is easing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/new-zealand-covid-cases-at-six-month-low-in-sign-winter-wave-is-easing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/new-zealand-covid-cases-at-six-month-low-in-sign-winter-wave-is-easing","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand Covid cases at six-month low in sign winter wave is easing","trailText":"Sunday’s daily case numbers lowest since start of Omicron wave in February, with other key indicators also trending down","byline":"Tess McClure in Auckland","body":"<p>New Zealand’s Covid infections have dropped to their lowest level in six months, in signs the winter wave that made it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/covid-becomes-equal-leading-cause-of-death-in-new-zealand-for-first-time\">one of the country’s biggest killers</a> is easing.</p> <p>On Sunday the daily health ministry briefing <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/472825/covid-19-update-lowest-number-of-daily-community-cases-since-february\">reported 2,618 cases</a>, the lowest number since Omicron cases took off in February.

Notwithstanding the parched ground, there is enough to eat and the cattle aren’t very motivated to move. They’ve obliged so far, passing through a sequence of fields until they arrived in this meadow about five days ago, but now I am going to require them to come into the handling area. The trailer will be here at 7.30am; I am entirely dependent on their cooperation.</p> <p>A long, low whistle and they raise their heads; another and, mercifully, they come. As they file in and make for the nuts I’ve brought, I slip out and quietly close the gate. Sending steers – young male cattle raised for meat – is inescapably at the core of what we do, but it never gets any easier.</p> <p>Following the BSE crisis, there was a ban on cattle aged over 30 months from entering the food chain. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, is largely under control and the rules have relaxed, but slaughter at this age still minimises risk. Our farming year pivots on this point – the bull works from June to August to ensure spring calving, so the steers are “finished” during the grass growing season.</p> <p>In other words, our prime cattle go straight from the field where they were born to the abattoir. The beef is sold through our local farm shop, three miles away. It’s as good as it gets, and yet it presents a conflict. I am proud and fond of these steers – I bottle-fed one for many months alongside his mother, an older cow with poor milk supply – so a sense of betrayal is implicit.</p> <p>It is simpler to get the whole herd into the race. Once they’re settled, we begin filtering them out, running all bar the steers back down a channel that leads to the field. They soon drift away; only the bull turns and calls to his winter companions. These are the moments that catch me. The steers are alerted but not stressed.

The four-legged brigade – made up of 290 sheep and goats – had just one task: to munch on as much vegetation as possible.</p> <p>Their arrival turned Barcelona into one of the latest places to embrace an age-old strategy that’s being revived as officials around the world face off against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/climate-crisis-driving-increase-in-wildfires-across-globe-says-report-aoe\">rise in extreme wildfires</a>.</p> <p>The idea is simple: wildfire-prone areas are handed over to grazing animals, who chomp and trample over dry vegetation that could otherwise accumulate as fuel for fires. Whether the animals are semi-wild or overseen by a shepherd who is usually compensated for their efforts, a job well done usually leaves behind a landscape dotted with open spaces that can act as firebreaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f22f0900dca69823ff5e0efb304cf70e70a0840\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f22f0900dca69823ff5e0efb304cf70e70a0840/0_164_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Controlled grazing begins on the Barcelona side of the Collserola natural park to prevent wildfires\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Controlled grazing begins on the Barcelona side of the Collserola natural park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ajuntament de Barcelona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s a nod to how wildfires were warded off in the past. “We’re not inventing anything new here,” said Guillem Canaleta of the Pau Costa Foundation, a Catalan non-profit that has been implementing the strategy since 2016 in the province of Girona, near Barcelona. “What we’re doing is recovering something that already existed and that was disappearing.”</p> <p>In Barcelona, the pilot project was launched in April in Collserola park, an <a href=\"https://www.barcelona.cat/en/que-pots-fer-a-bcn/parcs-i-jardins/parc-de-collserola_92086038562.html\">8,000 hectare (20,000 acres) green space</a> perched over the city and which sees an average of 50 fires a year, said Eloi Badia, the Barcelona city councillor for climate emergency and ecological transition.</p> <p>Usually the fires are swiftly put out. “It is not lost on anybody that if one day there was to be a major fire, it would have a big impact,” he said. “It’s a very urban park, surrounded by densely packed municipalities.”</p> <p>The city’s foray into the strategy echoes similar efforts around the world. In California, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/what-the-numbers-tells-us-about-a-catastrophic-year-of-wildfires\">more than 850,000 hectares</a> were consumed by wildfire last year, a dozen companies <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/goats-may-help-prevent-wildfires-in-california\">contract out goats</a> for targeted grazing. In northern Portugal, 45 endangered Garrano horses and their appetites <a href=\"https://grazelife.com/blog/grazing-to-minimise-wildfire-risk/\">were credited</a> with helping to spare the Faia Brava reserve from the devastating impact of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/portugal-forest-fires-under-control\">2017 wildfire</a>. In the Canadian province of British Columbia, <a href=\"https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019FLNR0153-001067\">cattle have been used</a> to clear areas at risk of wildfires.</p> <p>Parts of Spain adopted the strategy nearly two decades ago, when the southern region of Andalusia began paying shepherds to traverse its overgrown plains and valleys with their animals. The regional programme has since swelled to include more than <a href=\"https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/presidencia/portavoz/tierraymar/173685/CarmenCrespo/MedioAmbiente/IncendiosForestales/Ganaderia/Ovejas/Cabras/PlanInfoca/Prevencion/pastos/ReddeareasPastoCortafuegos/Rapca\">100,000 animals,</a> saving officials an <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/rbaps/fiche/rapca-red-de-areas-pasto-cortafuegos-de-andalucia-_en.htm?etrans=es\">estimated 75% of the cost</a> of having the land mechanically cleared.</p> <p>The grazing has brought about other benefits: the animals carry seeds and fertilise as they move through the terrain and their relatively indiscriminate feeding habits nurture biodiversity by curtailing the competitive advantage of some plants.</p> <p>Research has suggested <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13972\">targeted grazing can be effective</a> when paired with other wildfire prevention methods such as mechanical clearing and controlled burning, said Julia Rouet-Leduc, a researcher at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research at the University of Leipzig.</p> <p>“It’s not a miracle solution,” she added. “But it is part of a solution that can help landscapes be more resilient to fire.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2cac80d572384af10690b8b70a59a70d5d6aaf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2cac80d572384af10690b8b70a59a70d5d6aaf1/136_315_2321_1393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grazing the hills near Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grazing the hills near Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ajuntament de Barcelona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Its success lies in tackling the perfect storm created by climate change-induced drought and decades of rural exodus. “There’s a lot of this shrubby, woody vegetation that grows on former pastures or agricultural land that is creating a lot of fuel for wildfires,” she said. “And that leads to wildfires that are bigger and harder to control when they happen.”</p> <p>In Barcelona, where the pilot project wrapped up last month, plans are now under way to expand it to as many as three flocks and potentially more of the city’s green spaces.</p> <p>The animals ended up tending 72 hectares of the park, said Badia. But they also transformed the city in other, more subtle ways. “There was this boom of residents who wanted to visit the animals, it became the quintessential family activity,” he said. “So it also had this social and cultural impact.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/15/high-demand-for-aflw-tickets-prompts-change-to-53000-capacity-venue","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T03:54:19Z","webTitle":"‘Unprecedented’ demand for AFLW tickets prompts change to 53,000-capacity venue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/15/high-demand-for-aflw-tickets-prompts-change-to-53000-capacity-venue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/15/high-demand-for-aflw-tickets-prompts-change-to-53000-capacity-venue","fields":{"headline":"‘Unprecedented’ demand for AFLW tickets prompts change to 53,000-capacity venue","trailText":"Inaugural match between Essendon and Hawthorn shifted after tickets for the original venue sold out within 24 hours","byline":"Mike Hytner","body":"<p>The inaugural AFLW match between Essendon and Hawthorn has been shifted to the 53,000-capacity Marvel Stadium after tickets for the original venue sold out within 24 hours – and more games this season could be moved to bigger stadiums if interest levels remain high.</p> <p>The AFL said “unprecedented ticketing demands” for the first AFLW clash between the two expansion clubs resulted in the move from Port Melbourne’s ETU Stadium – which can hold 12,000 – across the Yarra River to the far larger Docklands venue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/12/missing-the-mark-could-afls-new-deal-leave-fewer-games-on-free-to-air-tv\">Missing the mark: could AFL’s new deal leave fewer games on free-to-air TV?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The women’s competition will grow to a full compliment of 18 clubs this season, with the Bombers and Hawks to join Port Adelaide and Sydney in making their AFLW debuts. </p> <p>The round one clash between the traditional rivals on 27 August attracted particular interest and a campaign to “Move it to Marvel” – led by the clubs – put pressure on the league to green light a switch.</p> <p>That pressure paid off after the initial allocation of tickets were quickly snapped up – reportedly inside just two hours of going on sale – and the AFL confirmed the venue change on Sunday. “The Essendon faithful have spoken,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/essendonfcw/status/1558722418784346113\">a Bombers tweet read</a>.</p> <p>The AFL said it had no choice but to make the move given the demand for tickets.</p> <p>“Quite simply the fans of both clubs, and supporters of women’s footy in general, showed why we needed to move to a bigger venue by selling out the game so quickly,” AFL administrator Travis Auld said.</p> <p>The venue change is reflective of the growing interest in the expanding women’s competition, which is heading into its seventh campaign and has seen record membership numbers and attendance rates off the back of last season.</p> <p>“We know the appetite for AFLW is huge, but the strength of sales across all nine round one matches and having an inaugural game sell out in a day is amazing,” the AFL’s general manager of women’s football Nicole Livingstone said.</p> <p>“To see two teams – and traditionally arch rivals, no less – debut to a packed Marvel Stadium is the stuff dreams are made of.”</p> <p>The AFL said it will monitor future ticket sales for games at ETU Stadium, with the league open to further venue changes if ticket sales warranted a bigger stadium.</p> <p>“We’re continuing to work with ETU or Port Melbourne Oval.

Currently the only example of circumstances where travel requests are likely to be approved is visiting or caring for partners or children who are seriously ill or dying or attending their funeral. The refusal rate of travel requests has led temporary protection visa holders to express concerns that this change in policy suggests that the next time they will be allowed to travel to see family members is to bury them.</p> <p>Kate Jackson, a migration agent who works predominantly with the Australian Hazara community says, “children have been murdered by the Taliban and in suicide bombings while waiting more than 10 years unnecessarily for their visa applications to be processed. These children could have been enjoying freedom in Australia if not for punitive policies which have inflicted unconscionable cruelty by wilfully delaying thousands of visa and citizenship applications”.</p> <p>The Labor government has the opportunity to transform this malevolent administration by adopting a humane approach which reflects Australian values.</p> <p>We urge the Albanese government to immediately grant permanent protection and facilitate family reunification for Afghan refugees already living in our communities and expedite processing of refugee and humanitarian visas for those facing grave danger in Afghanistan.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sitarah Mohammadi is spokesperson for the World Hazara Council and a current Juris Doctorate candidate.

My children are asking me ‘what have we done that these people are treating us this way?’ I have no response to them. The Taliban accuse of reporting sensitive information about the Taliban during the past 20 years. They oppress us and say we are responsible for the Taliban losses.”</p> <h2><strong>Salema, Afghanistan</strong></h2> <p>“The Taliban arrested and arbitrarily detained my 16-year-old son. In the morning they came into our neighbourhood and started shooting. We didn’t know what was happening. At first everyone thought they will not harm anyone as they had promised amnesty. But then the Taliban started searching for me and asked ‘where is Salema?’ I was so scared. I was crying and they took my hand in front and took me to the military car. I was in detention of the Taliban for one month. They were asking me if I was participating in women’s protests, and was I still reporting to Australian government. I told them that yes, I have worked for the Australian government, but I don’t report anything. After one month, they released me. The night I was detained, my son was injured.

You called us brothers. But now you leave us in this hell. Our lives are hell and we are left alone. We trusted each other; we never thought this would happen. The Taliban did not adhere to the amnesty they had announced, they are looking for ex-military forces to torture them every day, and they enjoy torturing them very much, and then they kill them. We ate together with them, slept under the same roof and trained together … If one of us would be killed, we would sympathise with each other like brothers, and Nato forces would always call us brothers. And these forces now leave us like this, alone.</p> <p>“They leave us with our hands tied, in front of the same enemies that we fought against for years. I think those countries that said they were strengthening democracy in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> and talking about peace were lying. They told us ‘we will never leave you alone’. They were here for 20 years, and now they have forgotten us. Every day we despair. We have no food to eat, and we know they, the Taliban, are coming for us.”</p> <h2>Demand for visas outstrips places</h2> <p>Australia is dealing with an unprecedented demand for humanitarian places for Afghans seeking sanctuary.</p> <p>About 5,500 Afghans have arrived in Australia on humanitarian visas since the fall of Kabul, but nearly 48,000 applications – representing more than 210,000 people – remain outstanding. This outstrips, by a factor of seven, the 31,500 places set asideAfghan nationals in the humanitarian program and family streams over the next four financial years.</p> <p>LEE applicants are prioritised by the Australian government, but most face a two-step process: an initial application for certification from the Department of Defence or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as a locally engaged employee; and a second application to home affairs for a humanitarian visa to travel to Australia.

But if the city government has its way, there will soon be one more source clamouring for ear space: loudspeakers blaring out state proclamations.</p> <p>The use of loudspeakers harkens back to cold war-era information sharing and propaganda. They were officially retired by the city’s mayor in 2017, but started creeping back in a limited capacity during Covid-19.</p> <p>The government has since unveiled plans to roll out loudspeakers for daily announcements starting this year, aiming to cover the entire city by 2025.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/17/vietnamese-activists-routinely-placed-under-house-arrest-report-finds\">Vietnamese activists routinely placed under house arrest, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Political analyst Carl Thayer called the plan “archaic and redundant” and at odds with the government’s usual “future-orientated” strategy with a “focus on digital technology”.</p> <p>“The average Vietnamese citizen prizes his/her independence to access news and information independently,” he said, adding the government could easily use a neighbourhood smartphone app instead.</p> <p>Human rights activist and Hanoi resident Nguyen Quang A said noise pollution in the city was already a “big problem” and reintroducing loudspeakers into the mix was likely to be “very annoying” and even “torturing”.</p> <p>Another Hanoi resident, a local journalist, was even more blunt. “I’d say most people, myself included, think this is a stupid idea,” he said, asking to remain anonymous. “The loudspeakers were an integral part of life during the war time, when it warned people of incoming bombers and gave updates on the frontline. Now it is at best a white noise machine, at worse a nuisance.”</p> <p>Nguyen Quang A said some local people were likely to be “frustrated” but couldn’t do anything about it except complain on social media, while others would support it simply because they supported the ruling Communist party.</p> <p>He called the decision “whimsical” and said it would probably only benefit “a few local officials” who desired the power, money and prestige that came with being in charge of a project.</p> <p>The other Hanoi resident similarly said he was “baffled” by the decision, pointing to a recent poll indicating 70% of the city population was against it. “I can only guess that maybe whoever is pushing for this policy also owns a loudspeaker company,” he quipped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a679c71dd13b457a59829cb031ead7ca06cd2515\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a679c71dd13b457a59829cb031ead7ca06cd2515/0_238_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Vietnamese police giving orders to pedestrians in Hanoi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Vietnamese police officer giving orders to pedestrians in Hanoi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Na Son Nguyen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thayer noted it was a Hanoi program meant to “empower local leaders at ward level” and promote local initiatives, and that there was no indication loudspeakers would be installed nationwide.</p> <p>Thayer also cautioned that the initiative was unrelated to “regime insecurity” or the ongoing crackdown on free speech. “There is scant evidence that the legitimacy of the current regime is losing widespread public support that can be remedied by the reintroduction of loud speakers on the streets of Hanoi.”</p> <h2>Low-tech propaganda</h2> <p>On the other side of South-east Asia in Myanmar, the new junta is also turning to old-school methods of propaganda. The country’s military became infamous for its use of social media to spread hate speech and disinformation during the Rohingya crisis, but it is now relying on more low-tech methods in conflict zones, where it has restricted the internet for many months.</p> <p>In the Sagaing region, where armed resistance to the 2021 coup has been particularly fierce, military planes and helicopters have airdropped pamphlets, blaming ongoing instability on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and ethnic-minority armed groups.</p> <p>Wai Phyo Myint of digital rights group Access Now said this type of heavy-handed propaganda was no longer effective. “Our different sources in Sagaing haven’t seen that in a few months,” she said, explaining that any material known to come from the military was discarded because people “don’t trust the source”.</p> <p>“What we are more concerned about is more sophisticated propaganda that obscures the source,” she said, adding that in internet blackout zones, this could be achieved through word-of-mouth networks.</p> <p>This would be particularly hard to counter because people couldn’t easily use the internet to verify news, she said.</p> <p>Albert, a battalion commander for the anti-coup Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF), confirmed this was already happening in Kayah state, another resistance stronghold.</p> <p>He said the junta had hijacked the distribution of international humanitarian aid to displaced civilians, allowing regime officials under the guise of charity workers to slander the KNDF.</p> <p>“As a result, some villagers have gone back and take the support and start to believe what the regime says,” Albert said. In areas where support for the KNDF remained strong, the regime withheld aid, he said.</p> <p>The junta tried to convince people that “all suffering is because of KNDF” and some people had “started to believe it and show hatred to us”, he said. “It is difficult.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/15/anthony-albanese-seeks-legal-advice-over-reports-scott-morrison-secretly-swore-himself-into-ministry-roles","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T00:23:04Z","webTitle":"Anthony Albanese seeks legal advice over reports Scott Morrison secretly swore himself into ministry roles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/anthony-albanese-seeks-legal-advice-over-reports-scott-morrison-secretly-swore-himself-into-ministry-roles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/anthony-albanese-seeks-legal-advice-over-reports-scott-morrison-secretly-swore-himself-into-ministry-roles","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Albanese seeks legal advice over reports Scott Morrison secretly swore himself into ministry roles","trailText":"Former prime minister’s senior cabinet colleagues say they were unaware he allegedly swore himself into three ministry positions","byline":"Josh Butler and Sarah Martin","body":"<p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is seeking legal advice over reports his predecessor, Scott Morrison, was secretly sworn into three ministry positions while in government, accusing Morrison of “running a shadow government”. </p> \n<p>Without the knowledge of some senior cabinet colleagues – including then finance minister Mathias Cormann – Morrison allegedly had himself secretly appointed as the minister for health, finance and resources at various times in office.

But this would not be enough alone, and the government under a new prime minister would face uncomfortable choices over the investment needed for new reservoirs and infrastructure, Armitt warned.</p> <p>“There is a cost of living crisis, especially with energy bills, and people don’t want to hear about water bills going up too,” he said. “But one way or another we have to find a way to pay for this new infrastructure.”</p> <p>Poorer households could be protected if the government stepped in to make the current billing systems fairer, Armitt added.</p> <p>England has experienced its driest July since 1911, with only about 10% of the average rainfall for the time of year in the south of England.

In fact, recruiting difficulties are not unique to the UK and several other countries have experienced high vacancy rates post-pandemic,” said Chris Forde, a professor at Leeds University and co-author of the report for ReWage.</p> <p>The report found hospitality and lower-skilled sectors were worst hit by the end of free movement of EU citizens into the UK. Hospitality lost 98,000 EU citizens in jobs in the two years to June 2021, and support services including cleaning and maintenance were down 64,000 EU workers.</p> <p>“While it is clear that ending free movement has made it harder for employers in low-wage industries to recruit staff, changing immigration policy to address shortages brings its own set of challenges,” said Madeleine Sumption, the director of the MO.</p> <p>The report found some sectors were adapting to the changes in migration but noted that filling low-paid vacancies would remain an issue. Sumption described immigration as a “bit of a blunt instrument”, noting it was “surprisingly difficult to measure shortages and work out how to target immigration policy towards them”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-statistics-year-ending-march-2022/why-do-people-come-to-the-uk-to-work\">Home Office statistics</a> show there has been a sharp increase in migration amid the easing of pandemic restrictions. The data shows 277,069 work-related visas were granted in the year ending March 2022 (including dependants), a 129% increase on the year ending March 2021 and a 50% increase on the year ending March 2020.</p> <p>Analysis of payrolled employees by nationality over a longer period, between July 2014 and June 2021, showed agriculture was also badly hit, losing 28% of EU workers, followed by hospitality at 25% and support services at 14%.

It has already set aside almost £66m against its tax bill for next year based on an estimated £250m of trading losses from 2021.</p> <p>If the company spends a similar amount on equipment for its warehouses this year, that number will rise again, so that Amazon would have to make profits of more than £600m in the UK before it paid corporation tax this year or next.</p> <p>Amazon said it had invested more on its warehouses and logistics systems last year as it had expanded its operation. The company invested more than £2.3bn in infrastructure last year as it opened five new warehouses in Swindon, Dartford, Gateshead, Hinckley and Doncaster, three of which were kitted out with its latest robotics technology. It also continued to build and operate datacentres in the UK.</p> <p>Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation said: “Even before the super-deductions, Amazon paid little corporation tax in the UK, in part because the bulk of their UK income is still booked in Luxembourg.</p> <p>“However, we now have a situation where Amazon UK Services are not only not paying tax, but they are being handed huge tax credits for investment that almost certainly would have happened anyway. This will ensure that tax payments are not only wiped out last year, but this year and future years as well.”</p> <p>He added that the super-deduction was designed to encourage investment ahead of a pending increase in corporation tax. Should Liz Truss become the next prime minister she has pledged to ditch that tax rise, which would mean Amazon would have benefited from the super-deduction tax break without facing a higher basic tax bill.</p> <p>Monaghan said the super-deduction would “in effect become an enormous £27bn sly handout to big businesses that are generating profits – and that’s on top of the £19bn per annum of [tax] revenues forgone due to cancellation of the rise itself”.</p> <p>“I think many big businesses will be really uncomfortable as to how this playing out.

But ministers have still not added Covid to the list of occupational diseases,” she said. “Two years into this pandemic that is shocking negligence. And it leaves workers unfairly exposed.”</p> <p>In a report, the TUC states: “At least 20,000 people die prematurely every year because of occupational disease as a result of occupational disease. There are more than 70 prescribed ‘occupational’ diseases known to be a risk from certain jobs. These diseases arise as a result of employment requiring close contact with a hazardous substance or circumstance.”</p> <p>Someone whose diagnosis has been linked to their job is able to claim financial support.</p> <p>Research by the International Labour Organization has shown that many other nations, including Australia, Canada and China, already recognise Covid as an occupational disease, subject to evidence of infection through a job role. In France it is automatically treated as such for healthcare workers, although the latter must have been affected by a severe form of coronavirus.</p> <p>At least 20 of the 50 states in the US presume that many first responders and key workers who get Covid – including paramedics and firefighters – have done so while at work.</p> <p>In Britain, ministers can designate an illness as an occupational disease subject to guidance from the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, an independent body, which assesses the evidence. However, in March last year it published a review which showed that some people were at double the risk of catching Covid if they worked in areas such as nursing, social care, bus or taxi driving, food processing, retail or security work.</p> <p>Employers are obliged to report cases of any prescribed disease to the Health and Safety Executive and their local council. Employees can then access benefits and compensation through the industrial injuries scheme to help them cope with their illness and disability.</p> <p>The British Medical Association and the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on coronavirus, which is made up of MPs and peers, already supports designation of Covid as a work-related hazard.

The NGOs call for the disbursement of badly needed Afghan banknotes that have been printed but are impounded in Poland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/14/hypocrisy-or-a-reason-for-hope-the-taliban-who-send-their-girls-to-school\">Hypocrisy or a reason for hope? The Taliban who send their girls to school</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Talks on the release of the central bank’s assets have been unresolved for months, partly because the west is not yet prepared to lift sanctions until the Taliban set up a more diverse government, permit girls to return to secondary school and allow independent control of the Afghan central bank. The European Union reiterated those broad demands in a statement issued on Sunday.</p> <p>The 32 NGOs – representing most of the major agencies operating in the country – say: “In the past 12 months millions of Afghans have endured a new wave of hardship, with widespread hunger, unemployment and near universal poverty. Ninety-five per cent of the population do not have enough food to eat. Women and girls are suffering disproportionately. NGOs on the ground are reporting that families are being forced to make impossible choices in order to survive.</p> <p>“The country is existing off an inadequate supply of humanitarian aid often transported in cash, as opposed to long-term development aid that can pay the salaries of teachers and hospital workers, as well as keep the infrastructure of public services functioning.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/14/life-for-afghan-women-one-year-after-the-taliban-took-power\">‘I was a policewoman. Now I beg in the street’: life for Afghan women one year after the Taliban took power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Samira Sayed Rahman, the Afghanistan-based advocacy coordinator for the International Rescue Committee, one of the NGOs that has signed the statement, said: “On a recent trip to the south and south-east, I saw a healthcare system in collapse. Hospitals have not had the money to pay their staff in months. They do not have the money for pharmaceuticals and medicine. They do not have the money for equipment. Much of the healthcare sector is being run by the goodwill of Afghan doctors and nurses. That is not a sustainable model. Many are trying to leave.”</p> <p>Asuntha Charles, the national director of World Vision Afghanistan, said: “The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is cataclysmic, and children – as ever in crises like this – are on the frontlines. Over 4 million children are out of school, the majority of them girls, and more than 1.1 million are engaged in child labour. I have met families forced to sell their children, as young as three years old, simply to survive. As the world’s attention drifts, Afghans are falling deeper into catastrophe. We cannot turn our backs on them now.”</p> <p>Vicki Aken, the Afghanistan country director for the International Rescue Committee, said: “At the root of this crisis is the country’s economic collapse. Decisions taken last year to isolate the Taliban – including the freezing of foreign reserves, the grounding of the banking system, and the halting of development assistance which financed most government services – have had a devastating impact. Extreme poverty is reducing demand for goods, forcing Afghan companies out of business, contributing to rising unemployment and exacerbating food insecurity.</p> <p>“We urgently need to find a solution. Humanitarian aid, whilst vital, cannot replace a functioning economy. For months, NGOs have been calling for a change in approach, yet our calls have fallen on deaf ears. There is no excuse for further inaction. It is time for donors and decision makers to take responsibility and work to establish a roadmap out of Afghanistan’s economic crisis by supporting the Afghan central bank and eventually beginning the phased, monitored release of frozen assets.”</p> <p>The US special representative for Afghanistan, Thomas West, and the under-ssecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian Nelson, last met Taliban officials at the end of July in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to discuss the terms for releasing $3.5bn (£2.9bn) of Afghan central bank assets held in the US. A further $3.5bn has controversially been set aside by the Biden administration to help victims of the 9/11 terror attacks.</p> <p>The west is unhappy at the Taliban’s appointment of a US-designated global terrorist, Noor Ahmad Agha, as deputy governor of the central bank. The US have been pressing for a body independent of the central bank to oversee the handling of any returned assets.</p> <p>The NGOs in their statement do not go into detail but say “necessary safeguards should be in place” if the bank’s reserves are returned.</p> <p>The inability of the bank to access the funds has resulted in a sharp depreciation of the Afghan currency, pushing up import prices, and led to a near collapse of the banking system, with citizens facing problems accessing savings and receiving salaries.</p> <p>The NGOs also call for donors and international financial institutions to disburse the remainder of funds in the World Bank-administered Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund, as well as expand the role of NGOs in the fund.</p> <p>In June the fund’s management committee approved the disbursement of $793m in two tranches to more long-term projects outside the Taliban’s control. The NGOs say funding and support must also be made available to Afghan civil society organisations, particularly organisations led by women inside and outside the country.</p> <p>Fereshta Abbasi, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: “Hard-won gains over the past 20 years are rapidly being undone, as women and girls are systematically erased from public life. They no longer have access to the rights to education, employment, or freedom of movement. Women who I speak to feel aggrieved by an overwhelming sense of abandonment, a feeling of hopelessness. We must hear their calls.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/1187","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T23:00:21Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 1,187","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/1187","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/1187","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 1,187","trailText":"Quiptic crossword No 1,187","byline":"Pasquale","body":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/14/three-arrested-on-suspicion-of-after-man-60-dies-in-dagenham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T22:44:09Z","webTitle":"Three arrested on suspicion of murder after man, 60, dies in Dagenham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/14/three-arrested-on-suspicion-of-after-man-60-dies-in-dagenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/14/three-arrested-on-suspicion-of-after-man-60-dies-in-dagenham","fields":{"headline":"Three arrested on suspicion of murder after man, 60, dies in Dagenham","trailText":"Victim pronounced dead at scene after police called to reports of a fight in east London","byline":"Jane Clinton","body":"<p>Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 60-year-old man died in east London.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police were called at just after midnight on Sunday to reports of a fight at the junction of Ford Road and Broad Street in Dagenham.

The author’s work has attracted deaths threats for years. But, Reese said, “he was very upbeat in the green room, the way he is.”</p> <p>They had been looking forward to continuing the discussion about the importance of offering asylum to imperiled writers when the event began, taking their seats on stage at 10.45am. “We go out minutes later on stage,” Reese said. “He wanted to talk about welcoming writers in exile into communities and how positive that is for everyone.”</p> <p>Then a man leapt up on the stage and rushed towards them. “It was a tragic irony in so many ways,” Reese said. “The horror of it, all the layering of the realities.”</p> <p>He went on: “Here was Rushdie who had lived this already, who was speaking so courageously for many years, who was about to talk about his experiences and the value of protecting writers, and now we have this extraordinary materialisation happening right on stage. It was so resonant of why we need to defend precisely those values.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4dd34308dbcde5781ee62d8196e8cd2d12d707f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4dd34308dbcde5781ee62d8196e8cd2d12d707f/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chautauqua Institution in New York, where author Salman Rushdie was attacked on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chautauqua Institution in New York, where author Salman Rushdie was attacked on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reese declined to talk about what he saw or heard during the attempt on Rushdie’s life, saying he may have to testify in future legal proceedings. But he did describe the surreal sense as the violence unfolded.</p> <p>“Initially I thought this was somebody coming up doing the worst case joke in the world, a joke on what had happened in the past, not a real thing,” Reese said. “Looking back on it, I suppose I should never have thought that given Salman’s life story. Then, obviously, it became very real.”</p> <p>Reese, during Rushdie’s stabbing, suffered facial injuries that required hospital treatment. He said his ailments were “meaningful enough, but not anything like those Salman suffered”.</p> <p>For 48 hours, Reese had no idea whether the novelist would live or die. Over the weekend it was revealed that Rushdie had been stabbed 10 times in the neck, an eye, the abdomen and thigh.</p> <p>Reese woke up Sunday morning to a statement from Rushdie’s son, Zafar Rushdie, which said that though the writer was still in critical condition in hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, he had been taken off a ventilator and was able to say a few words.</p> <p>“His usual feisty and defiant sense of humour remains intact,” Zafar Rushdie said.</p> <p>Reese laughed heartily when he read those words, saying, “It is joyous that Salman is in recovery. ‘Defiant humour’ is quite him. If you can imagine living with such a threat over your head for years, if you didn’t have defiant humor, as he does, I don’t know how you would cope and contribute so much to the pursuit of freedom of thought.”</p> <p>Rushdie has been subjected to a fatwa calling for his death since 1989, when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran issued it in the wake of the publication of the novel The Satanic Verses, which some Islamic leaders regard as blashphemous. As a result, the Indian-born, British-American novelist spent much of the following decade in hiding.</p> <p>In 1997, while Rushdie was under deep British government protection, he gave a speech at the University of Pittsburgh at the invitation of the English writer Christopher Hitchens, who was on the faculty at the time. Reese attended and heard Rushdie talk about the critical value of offering help to endangered writers.</p> <p>That inspired Reese to set up City of Asylum.</p> <p>The group currently supports five exiled writers on the programme, having converted several abandoned houses in Pittsburgh into refuges.</p> <p>Reese hopes that the shock and horror of Friday will act as a wake-up call – and a call to action – for people in the US and beyond. He hopes that in the short term additional security will be provided for Rushdie “at the very minimum until they understand what’s going on here, and until he can express his own wishes”.</p> <p>In the longer term he hopes that writers around the world will continue to create in the spirit of Rushdie.</p> <p>“A spirit of fearlessness and truth to yourself – don’t be intimidated, if anything you should be re-energised by what we have just been through, and challenged not to let yourself down,” Reese added.</p> <p>For himself, Reese plans to move on and redouble his efforts to provide homes for writers under threat. He quotes a fellow advocate whose mantra is that joy is an act of resistance.</p> <p>“At the end of the day,” Reese said, “that should inspire us all.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/14/we-were-promised-honey-review-glimpses-into-uncertain-futures","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T22:00:20Z","webTitle":"We Were Promised Honey! review – glimpses into uncertain futures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/we-were-promised-honey-review-glimpses-into-uncertain-futures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/14/we-were-promised-honey-review-glimpses-into-uncertain-futures","fields":{"headline":"We Were Promised Honey! review – glimpses into uncertain futures","trailText":"Sam Ward takes hints from his audience to imagine how their lives could go from here, in a bittersweet contemplation of fate","byline":"Mark Fisher","body":"<p>There is a joke in Waiting for Godot that comes after a rare moment of action. “That passed the time,” says Vladimir. “It would have passed in any case,” retorts Estragon.</p> <p>Writer/performer Sam Ward gives the audience the same alternatives in We Were Promised Honey.

We are immersed dizzily in the grainy, boxy 1980s and 90s, with no talking heads, captions or scripted narrator to steady our thoughts. But via his choice of clips, Perkins is, of course, telling us the story he wants to tell. What he patches together is a carnival of grotesquery in which the media, the public and the royal family all look as sordid and twisted as each other.</p> <p>Doom has already gathered when Diana and Prince Charles give their first interviews after becoming engaged, Diana blinking into the middle distance as the pair fail to answer any questions designed to provoke a relatable insight into their relationship. Their only shared interest seems to be an exhausted horror at press harassment. On that topic, we are soon watching a man on a TV debate show expertly asserting that this situation is about to improve: “I think we’re going to see a change in the attitude of the press. I think that now she’s palpably one of the royal family, all this telephoto lens business will stop.”</p> <p>Perkins has a weakness for chortling ironically at takes that haven’t aged well. Later, he includes TV coverage of Charles and Diana’s wedding procession with a commentator adding reassuring behind-the-scenes details: “The escort, under the command of Lt Col Andrew Parker-Bowles … Charles and Lady Diana stayed with him and his wife Camilla in Wiltshire on two occasions at the end of the year. So, they’re among friends.”</p> <p>But The Princess also displays a fine eye for oblique, jarring, mischievous moments where the curtain lifts and we see the machine whir and splutter. With the wedding ceremony done, we watch rough, partly obscured footage of the royal couple arriving at the secluded back door of Buckingham Palace, totally unsmiling in a brief interregnum between being stared at by the hordes lining the route from St Paul’s, and being stared at by the hordes waiting in front for the balcony kiss. Charles looks listlessly at his lap for a moment, as if he might sneak out a smartphone and start tediously scrolling Instagram.</p> <p>Time zips by. Before we can breathe, they have a child and all is not well, as evidenced by Perkins’ choice of footage regularly suggesting that fatherhood doesn’t interfere with Charles’s beloved hobbies: shotgunning pheasants to bits, encouraging packs of dogs to tear foxes and hares apart, and – hours after Harry is born – playing polo, watched by Camilla. But once Diana properly starts her royal duties, something shifts. She is phenomenally skilled at being a public figure. To Charles’s dismay, she eclipses him, visiting Aids clinics and Harlem hospitals, chatting easily with all-comers, doing the thing the family she has married into has always struggled with. She is popular.</p> <p>It can’t last. Stories about bulimia, self-harm and affairs start to seep out, via the Andrew Morton book, the James Gilbey tapes, the Charles and Camilla tapes, the Anne Pasternak book, the Martin Bashir interview – each revelation bloodily dissected by the public and press, all madly confident in their analysis of people they haven’t met. As well as sharing Adam Curtis’s love of eerie out-takes and revealing offcuts, Perkins seems to have Chris Morris’s full-spectrum disdain for everyone in the media industry: his go-to for illustrating this sordid circus is Robert Kilroy-Silk archly refereeing TV shouting matches, and he enjoys the easy sport of making royal correspondents look like tragic parasites. Heavyweights such as Jeremy Paxman, Oprah Winfrey and Jonathan Dimbleby are nonethless shown as players in the same grubby, absurd game. The inclusion of a clip of future Brass Eye co-stars Darcus Howe and Peregrine Worsthorne, earnestly discussing “Camilla Bowles Parker”, might even be a sly Morris homage.</p> <p>As the 90s provide numerous too-perfect visual metaphors, such as Windsor Castle literally catching fire (Perkins shows us a shocked Queen being comforted by the uncontroversial, dependable Prince Andrew), The Princess’s latter stages vividly evoke the queasy feeling that Dianamania cannot be controlled. She outrages the paparazzi by sometimes posing for photos, but at other times deliberately evading or ruining them (“She’s very close to being a monster,” says one of the film’s endless array of crusty, chuntering male pundits). She cannot enjoy a Saint-Tropez sun-lounger holiday without a pack of balding, greasy men capturing blurry but saleable images of her torso from 200m away, forcing her to scurry back indoors. We know, because we are with the paps: “She’s spotted us!” Yet, post-divorce, not knowing that death is around the corner, she accelerates her public appearances, looking freer, more forthright, her dresses and haircuts seeming to get sharper and sexier each time.</p> <p>If The Princess has a definitive statement to make about Diana, it comes from that contrast: amid so much that was tawdry and bizarre, she somehow gave the impression of remaining pristine. Looking back, what she was trying to escape was peculiarly grim.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/14/yevhen-pronin-if-we-do-not-kill-them-they-can-kill-our-children","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T21:30:20Z","webTitle":"Yevhen Pronin: ‘If we do not kill them, they can kill our children’ | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/14/yevhen-pronin-if-we-do-not-kill-them-they-can-kill-our-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/14/yevhen-pronin-if-we-do-not-kill-them-they-can-kill-our-children","fields":{"headline":"Yevhen Pronin: ‘If we do not kill them, they can kill our children’","trailText":"The acting president of Ukraine’s Athletics Federation has such a reputation for flying drones against Russian targets that he has a bounty on his head","byline":"Sean Ingle","body":"<p>Like many of those going to the European athletics championships in Munich this week Yevhen Pronin recently posted <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pronin_law_you/\" title=\"\">a video of himself on Instagram</a>. But the clip had a surreal twist: the 31-year-old, acting president of Ukraine’s athletics federation, was wearing military fatigues. And he was running not for time but from bullets and explosions in Donetsk.</p> <p>There will be plenty of stories from these championships over the next week, with Britain hoping for a glut of medals from Dina Asher-Smith, Laura Muir, Jake Wightman and others. However, none will be as remarkable as the one told by Pronin. Six months ago he was a lawyer and sports official. Now he has earned such a reputation for flying drones that he has a bounty on his head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/14/ukraine-says-it-will-target-russian-soldiers-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant\">Ukraine says it will target Russian soldiers at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We drop bombs not just on Russian tanks but Russian cars and on houses where they are situated,” he says. “We have drones with some small bombs, maybe 300 grams, for example. It’s impossible to crush a tank. You can only kill soldiers. But some of the bombs have great power.”</p> <p>He points to one of his videos. “I show you this – two Russian soldiers here, so I drop the bomb here, like a basketball as you see. The machine moves here and crushes them, so they died.”</p> <p>When Pronin is asked how he feels about this, he is unequivocal. “I feel great because I am doing this for my country. If we do not kill them, they can kill our children, they can kill us. But of course I’m not a killer in real life.”</p> <p>Like many Ukrainians, Pronin signed up for the army immediately after the invasion, amid fears his country could be overrun in days. “Emotionally I’m in a stable place. But February 25 I was in a bad situation. The Russians were 10 minutes from my home and I remember my girlfriend crying. And then I opened [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy’s Instagram and he said: ‘Don’t give me a ride, give me weapons’. And I was shocked. And I think every Ukrainian decided then that we would start fighting.” Before the war, he had flown drones for fun, so he asked his military leader whether he could use those skills in war. He was quickly given a harsh induction into the brutal realities of war as Russian soldiers closed in on Kyiv.</p> <p>Sometimes, he says, he was just 100m or 200m away from his enemies. “I had no experience before but I knew that war could start. So I was ready for that, mentally and emotionally. A lot of drone operators are young people because they have experience in video games,” he adds. “But, you know, war is different. The Russian artillery can kill you in one second.”</p> <p>It is, he admits, a far cry from his former life with his 30‑year‑old fiancée, Ramina Eshakzai – a well‑known TV star, fashion model and journalist. She is now abroad, while Pronin has been given special permission to leave Donetsk to make the drive to Munich, where he will watch the small Ukrainian team – which includes the world high jump silver medallist Yaroslava Mahuchikh – compete.</p> <p>But inevitably his thoughts drift back towards his home country, where he is in a unit known as the Tactical Busters. He will not confirm his number of kills, as it is confidential. However he adds: “We work every day on the front line. We all do reconnaissance, we know how many Russian soldiers are in the same position, how many tanks or cars. After that, we do the papers for the Minister of Defence. Of course, it’s a lot. A lot of tanks, a lot of cars, a lot of Russians.”</p> <p>Some of his work is later posted on his Instagram account, which he hopes will keep awareness for his country’s struggles high. “Yes, it’s propaganda. Most Ukrainian soldiers do it now. It’s a new war, a new type of war. Everybody records. Everybody does videos. We are careful not to reveal our position. But the Russians can understand it is us.</p> <p>“One month ago our security services sent me a recording of a dialogue of the Russians and they spoke about us, our group. They said something like ‘fucking drone team’. And they say to their soldiers if they can catch one of our group alive, they either give them some money or some days off.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/10/gb-stars-hope-for-encore-in-munichs-trailblazing-european-championships\">GB stars hope for encore in Munich’s trailblazing European Championships</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Pronin has warm words for many of his fellow Ukrainians, and especially his president, Zelenskiy, and Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, he cannot hide his disappointment with his fellow countryman Sergey Bubka who, he says, did not even link up with Ukraine’s athletes in Eugene. “I respect him as a great sportsman but I don’t as the president of the National Olympic Committee or the vice-president of World Athletics. When the war started, he said it was ‘trouble’. It’s not trouble, it’s war.”</p> <p>However, Pronin is hugely grateful for the support of the World Athletics president, Seb Coe, and the leaders of 20 other athletics federations who called him to promise help. “Coe called me on FaceTime and was shocked as I was in military uniform. They all asked how they could help me. We relocated all of our sports stars and many children, too.”</p> <p>Towards the end of the conversation Pronin is told he has an amazing story. “Why?” he responds. “It’s normal.” But not, he hopes, for too much longer.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T21:30:20Z","webTitle":"Labour announces plan to freeze energy price cap with reinforced windfall tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax","fields":{"headline":"Labour announces plan to freeze energy price cap with reinforced windfall tax","trailText":"Keir Starmer says people won’t pay ‘a penny more’ and that plan would reduce inflation","byline":"Andrew Sparrow and Phillip Inman","body":"<p>Keir Starmer has put a beefed-up £8bn windfall tax on energy company profits at the heart of a new plan to stop people having to pay “a penny more” on fuel bills this winter.</p> <p>The Labour leader confirmed that under his plan the energy price cap would be frozen at the current level, meaning that an expected 80% rise in October – taking an average household bill to about £3,600 – would not go ahead.</p> <p>Starmer said the country was facing “a national emergency” and that Labour “wouldn’t let people pay a penny more” on energy bills as a result of his “fully funded plan”. A typical family would save £1,000, he claimed.</p> <p>He said: “Britain’s cost of living crisis is getting worse, leaving people scared about how they’ll get through the winter. Labour’s plan to save households £1,000 this winter and invest in sustainable British energy to bring bills down in the long term is a direct response to the national economic emergency that is leaving families fearing for the future.”</p> <p>Starmer said the plan would cost £29bn over the winter and that it could be funded by extending the scope of the windfall tax on energy companies (raising £8bn), halting the proposed £400 payments for all households offered by the government to compensate for the price cap rise scheduled for October (saving £14bn), and lowering government interest payments on debt (saving £7bn), which Labour said would be possible because its plan would reduce inflation.</p> <p>Last week Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, and Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, called for the energy price cap to be frozen at its current level and released plans explaining how this could be funded.</p> <p>This led to criticism that Starmer, who was on holiday at the time, was letting them, rather than the Labour leadership, set the agenda.</p> <p>Starmer’s plan was released as it was reported that Boris Johnson was on his second foreign holiday of the summer. He was photographed with his wife, Carrie, in a town near Athens. Earlier this month the couple had a break in an eco-hotel in Slovenia.</p> <p>The energy price cap is now set at £1,971 and it is expected to almost double in October, with a further increase expected in January. Economists and charities have said millions of households will be plunged into poverty as a result, or left unable to pay.</p> <p>The government has not proposed suspending the energy price cap rise, but it has announced an array of measures intended to help people pay their bills, and Johnson has said he is certain that his successor will offer more help in the autumn.</p> <p>But neither Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and frontrunner in the contest to replace him, nor Rishi Sunak, her rival and the former chancellor, are calling for the energy price cap to be frozen.</p> <p>And although both of them have signalled that that they would offer extra cash support to households, neither have proposed a full plan to fund this other than through extra borrowing. Truss maintains that her real priority is cutting the tax burden.</p> <p>Starmer stressed that his proposal for the winter was part of a wider plan that also involves insulating 19m homes over the next decade. If the government had started that when Labour proposed it a year ago, 2m homes could have been insulated by now, saving typical occupants £1,000 a year, he claimed.</p> <p>Under the energy price cap, Labour would need £29bn to pay energy companies to cover the gap between what they would receive from customers and what they would have to pay for energy on the wholesale market.</p> <p>As well as freezing the energy price cap, the Labour plan would involve support for people not protected by the price cap, and a scheme to ensure people on prepayment meters do not have to pay more for their energy than people paying monthly.</p> <p>Brown, as part of his plan, suggested the government should consider taking energy companies into temporary public ownership. Starmer has rejected this proposal on the grounds that money from the package should go towards helping customers, not compensating shareholders, a party source said.</p> <p>To raise an extra £8bn from the windfall tax, Labour would close a loophole allowing tax relief on fossil fuel investment and backdate the tax to January.</p> <p>The Labour announcement was welcomed by Davey. “Now that progressive parties and charities are speaking with one voice to cancel the energy price hike using a windfall tax, the woeful response from Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak is even more outrageous,” the Lib Dem leader said.</p> <p>“The government’s dither and delay from this prime minister and any future prime minister is deeply damaging for pensioners and families across the country.”</p> <p>Labour says that as a result of its plan, energy bills would add just two percentage points to inflation over the winter, instead of the six percentage points currently forecast. This figure has been backed up by analysis from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank.</p> <p>Luke Murphy, an associate director for climate and energy at the IPPR, said Labour’s plans would “prevent soaring energy bills from pushing millions into debt and destitution, and hold down ever rising inflation which is a risk to the UK’s economic stability”.</p> <p>But many international and domestic economic thinktanks have urged the government to boost means-tested benefits to target the households most at risk from rising energy bills.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rebuked European countries, including the UK, for offering universal subsidies that also benefit better-off households in addition to higher benefits.</p> <p>Adrian Pabst, the deputy director of public policy at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “I find it surprising that political parties should want to subsidise the companies that supply energy, and by that households that are better able to cope with the energy shock. It is more socially equitable to deal with the problem by increasing universal credit.”</p> <p>Pabst was sceptical that a freeze in the cap would bring down inflation by a significant margin and that the Bank of England would react by halting expected interest rate rises.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/14/jurgen-klopp-backs-luis-diaz-to-be-consistent-scorer-for-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T21:30:20Z","webTitle":"Jürgen Klopp backs Luis Díaz to be consistent scorer for Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/jurgen-klopp-backs-luis-diaz-to-be-consistent-scorer-for-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/14/jurgen-klopp-backs-luis-diaz-to-be-consistent-scorer-for-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Jürgen Klopp backs Luis Díaz to be consistent scorer for Liverpool","trailText":"The Liverpool manager believes his side’s style of play will ensure Luis Díaz follows Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané in becoming a consistent Premier League goalscorer","byline":"Andy Hunter","body":"<p>Jürgen Klopp believes Liverpool’s style of play will ensure Luis Díaz follows the path of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané in becoming a consistent Premier League goalscorer.</p> <p>The Colombia international has made an impressive impact since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/liverpool-luis-diaz-tottenham-kulusevski-bentancur-transfer-news\">arriving from Porto in January</a> although has yet to reproduce the clinical form that delivered 16 goals in 26 games for the Portuguese club last season.

We need to see it but of course that is his potential.” Klopp added: “We work on it but not with Luis specifically – we don’t take him out because the other two scored [Salah and Darwin Núñez] and he didn’t so we show him how. That’s not necessary. You can’t force it. People asked: ‘How can you play without Sadio?’ when in November/December everybody was thinking about when he would score the next goal. You just let it go.</p> <p>“You see the situations he [Díaz] had [at Fulham], big chances, and he was unlucky. He is in a really good shape and that is more important. It’s not that I tell him after a game, ‘You should have scored here or there’. The boys know that in the moment. It happens. It’s a normal process.”</p> <p>Salah and Mané both improved immeasurably in front of goal after signing for Klopp and the Liverpool manager believes his system will help Díaz develop in a similar way. Klopp, whose team face Crystal Palace at Anfield on Monday, explained: “It is the way we play. It’s the way we bring the boys in the situation. Of course, it is about whether it is in you or not, but it’s the way we play, how we position the players, how we protect the players, where we win the balls back and how the boys can use their speed in these moments. They will be in a lot of goalscoring situations and that then makes you the player we remember.</p> <p>“Sadio scored three against us when he played for Southampton but it is not that he scored every week. He didn’t even start the game when he scored three against us. The consistency came with the confidence, with the teammates and with the structure of our game. That is what we are working on. The way we play should help strikers. He [Díaz] obviously has the quality and the potential and if we can put the miles in his legs during pre-season that will help in the long term. That’s what will happen but we are not about the long-term, we are about now. He just needs one goal and then we will go from there.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/15/morning-mail-afghan-refugee-visa-limbo-turnbull-backs-voice-olivia-newton-johns-best","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T21:00:42Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Afghan refugee visa limbo, Turnbull backs voice, Olivia Newton-John’s best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/morning-mail-afghan-refugee-visa-limbo-turnbull-backs-voice-olivia-newton-johns-best","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/morning-mail-afghan-refugee-visa-limbo-turnbull-backs-voice-olivia-newton-johns-best","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Afghan refugee visa limbo, Turnbull backs voice, Olivia Newton-John’s best","trailText":"<strong>Monday:</strong> Today marks one year since the Taliban recaptured Kabul but some who fled the capital are stuck in a legal limbo.

The actors’ rich, detailed performances will welcome you in","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","body":"<p>The opening minutes of Marriage (BBC One) could be accused of pulling a fast one. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/25/sean-bean-on-time-makeup-and-his-trans-role-if-i-did-it-today-thered-be-an-uproar\">Sean Bean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/17/nicola-walker-star-of-unforgotten-and-the-split-returns-to-the-theatre\">Nicola Walker</a>, two surefire indicators of good-quality British TV, are married couple Ian and Emma. We meet them as they wait at the airport for their flight home, after a holiday in Spain. The first real line of dialogue is “I had to pay for the ketchup”, and they bicker over whether Emma should have asked the man at the cafe if he would make a jacket potato for Ian, despite it looking as if they only sold chips.</p> <p>Opening with a low-stakes row about potatoes, and the fact that Marriage comes from the pen of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/05/stefan-golaszewski-marriage-bbc-one-sean-bean-nicola-walker\">Stefan Golaszewski</a>, creator of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/01/him-and-her-tv-review\">Him &amp; Her</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/15/mum-review-bbc-two-lesley-manville-peter-mullan\">Mum</a>, suggests that this will be about finding wry humour in the mundane reality of a long-term relationship. Emma and Ian talk about dodgy tummies and who will pick up the parcel that has been left with a nextdoor neighbour. They watch TV and tease each other about the state of their pants. There’s nothing wrong with the mundane, as Golaszewski’s previous shows have proved again and again. Plenty of people tune in to watch Gogglebox every week, and that’s just us watching people watching telly. Done well, it can be a voyeuristic treat.</p> <p>The light touch is deceptive, though, and Marriage soon reveals that it won’t quite be the gentle series it first appears. All the characters in the couple’s lives talk to each other in cliches and platitudes. They stick to the script of human communication, politely indulging in small talk, while hardly ever daring to say what they truly mean. Emma has an oddly excruciating chat with her younger, smarmy boss Jamie about what a risk it is to buy clothes online. Ian tries to be friendly with the receptionist at the gym, then dithers about how to fix it when he realises he has made the wrong impression.</p> <p>There are long stretches of action without dialogue, and the show is as allergic to exposition as it is to characters finishing their sentences. As Emma visits her elderly father, a man sitting with him hides upstairs – we don’t yet know who he is. Emma’s father is frosty, then accusatory, and in a single line we understand what is happening in their relationship, and the role that Ian has to play. They shift boxes from the bed of their daughter’s childhood room, and there are no children at home. We find out why in slow, steady reveals that are sparse and deeply affecting.</p> <p>Of course, this requires a lot of trust in the writing, and the storytelling. You have to hold out your hand and be willing to be led, believing that it will take you somewhere you want to go. Bean taps into some of that pain, pushed down and away, that he performed so memorably in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/18/time-former-hmp-inmate-jimmy-mcgovern-sean-bean-stephen-graham\">Jimmy McGovern’s prison drama Time</a>. Even the small details here are rich. When he goes to the gym, the younger men give up their weights for him and call him “Sir”. It is a neat show of how old he must feel, and how surprised he is to feel it. Walker clings on to a busy, brittle briskness that suggests she doesn’t have time for feelings, particularly the big, complicated ones that keep threatening to intrude.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/05/stefan-golaszewski-marriage-bbc-one-sean-bean-nicola-walker\">‘Laughing at farts is the bedrock of a good relationship’ – the writer of Marriage shares his wisdom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is all about feelings, in the end. There is a pitch-perfect realism to the way these characters talk without really saying anything, then put across what they really mean while saying nothing at all. It’s so cleverly done. When their daughter Jess comes to visit, bringing her new boyfriend, you want to shake every single one of them into listening to what is actually being said and to act on it.</p> <p>There is a lot of dithering, and a lot of keeping difficult conversations at arm’s length. This can be frustrating. It is an hour long, and you feel it. The tension it whips up – in Emma’s place of work, or in Ian’s lonely wandering, or at dinner with Jess’s creepy and controlling partner – can be genuinely unpleasant to sit through. But that is the point. This is all about the light and shade, the big and the small moments, what makes a marriage work and the cracks that can appear in it. It’s true that charging for sachets of tomato ketchup is an outrage; as is a colleague leaving rubbish on your desk; as is dealing with a demanding older parent, or an arrogant younger man. By the time they’re discussing the merits of a pre-dinner snack – traditional peanuts, or the pricier cashews? – the intimacy between Ian and Emma has welcomed in the viewer, too.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/14/thomas-tuchel-suggests-anthony-taylor-should-not-referee-chelsea-again","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T20:12:44Z","webTitle":"Thomas Tuchel suggests Anthony Taylor should not referee Chelsea again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/thomas-tuchel-suggests-anthony-taylor-should-not-referee-chelsea-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/14/thomas-tuchel-suggests-anthony-taylor-should-not-referee-chelsea-again","fields":{"headline":"Thomas Tuchel suggests Anthony Taylor should not referee Chelsea again","trailText":"The Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, played down his confrontation with Antonio Conte, who said: ‘Next time, we don’t shake hands’","byline":"Jacob Steinberg at Stamford Bridge","body":"<p>Thomas Tuchel suggested it may be better if Anthony Taylor no longer referees Chelsea’s games but the German played down his row with Antonio Conte after the rival managers clashed moments after Harry Kane rescued a late point for Tottenham at Stamford Bridge.</p> \n<p>Tempers were high during a passionate London derby, with Tuchel and Conte both facing touchline bans after being sent off after the final whistle. The two managers had both been booked after squaring up to each other in the wake of the first Spurs equaliser, which Chelsea argued should have been disallowed for a challenge by Rodrigo Bentancur on Kai Havertz and then for offside against Richarlison, and they had to be pulled apart again after full time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Kane snatches draw for Spurs at Chelsea as clashing Conte and Tuchel see red</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tuchel reacted furiously when he went to shake hands with Conte, pulling the Spurs manager back and telling him to look him in the eye. “I thought when we shake hands you looked in each other’s eyes,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “He had a different opinion. It was not necessary but a lot of things were not necessary.”</p> \n<p>However, Tuchel was quick to laugh off the incident, saying that he enjoyed it and making it clear that he had no bad feelings towards Conte and was more interested in questioning the refereeing.</p> \n<p>Chelsea, who led twice through fine efforts from Kalidou Koulibaly and Reece James, were livid with both Spurs goals. Tuchel erupted when Taylor did not penalise Bentancur shortly before Pierre-Emile Højbjerg made it 1-1 midway through the second half and he was even more bewildered when Mike Dean, the video assistant referee, did not penalise Cristian Romero for pulling Marc Cucurella’s hair before the corner that led to Kane equalising in the 96th minute.</p> \n<p>It was put to Tuchel that many Chelsea fans bear a historical grudge against Taylor, who has been involved in several controversial incidents with the west London club during his career. An online petition calling for the 43-year-old not to be given Chelsea games attracted more than 80,000 signatures last season and Tuchel answered forcefully when he was asked whether he had the same view as his team’s supporters. “Maybe that would be better,” Tuchel said. “Maybe it would be better but we also have VAR to help make the right decisions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bd156a296b329744adf7dfdb936627c0b097f48\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bd156a296b329744adf7dfdb936627c0b097f48/0_28_2577_1547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Referee Anthony Taylor shows a red card to Thomas Tuchel \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Taylor shows a red card to Thomas Tuchel but the German was more bothered about what he saw as mistakes by the referee and the VAR</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Walton/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Since when can players be pulled by their hair?

This does not even have to do with the referee in this case. If he does not see something that’s why we have people to check if there is a decisive error going on.”</p> \n<p>Tuchel, who could be charged by the Football Association for his comments, noted that it is not just the fans who think Chelsea have not had the rub of the green with Taylor. “I can assure you that the whole dressing room, every single person thinks that,” he said. “I cannot understand how the first goal is not offside.</p> \n<p>“And I cannot understand since when players can pull other people’s hair and stay on the pitch and attack in the last corner. This for me is without any explanation and I don’t want to accept it. I have no words for it.

Tuchel later sped past the Spurs bench down the touchline when James made it 2-1, but there was more to come.</p> \n<p>“If I see aggressivity my answer is aggressivity,” Conte said. “The referee showed me the red card but he didn’t understand the dynamic of what happened.

It would be a pity if for this situation we miss the next game.”</p> \n<p>Chelsea are interested in Anthony Gordon, but a deal for the Everton midfielder is unlikely to be this summer.

What makes theatre theatre? What’s needed and what’s not? With Learning to Fly – as, indeed, with his earlier Songs of Friendship trilogy of shows – writer-performer James Rowland demonstrates how the best performances can do an awful lot with very little.</p> <p>There’s no set, no sound design, no costume changes. The only music comes from a portable record player, which Rowland operates himself. It’s just him, us and a story. With enchanting simplicity, Rowland tells us about an unlikely friendship from his youth, with the reclusive old lady who lived down the street. It starts, like many a fairytale or horror movie, with a creepy, overgrown house and its similarly sinister inhabitant. But Rowland repeatedly sets up tropes and expectations only to knowingly subvert them, as the relationship between this lonely teenager and his enigmatic neighbour gathers layers of heart-tugging complexity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/medea-review-adura-onashile-liz-lochhead-the-hub-edinburgh\">Medea review – Adura Onashile exudes awesome authority in bloody tragedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s a deceptive piece. The story seems, in some ways, so small. Rowland narrates events from across a relatively short time span, mostly confined to a cul-de-sac in Didsbury. Not a lot happens, really, over the course of the hour-long running time. But just like Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony – which provides the musical and dramaturgical backbone of the show – Learning to Fly connects the trivial to the cosmic. In its specificity, this narrative deftly touches on profound truths about what it means to be human. It captures, with remarkable precision, the joyful, sad, ridiculous mess of it all.</p> <p>It helps, of course, that Rowland is a consummate storyteller. He’s often puppyish in his enthusiasm, bouncing around the stage with seemingly boundless energy. But he also makes brilliantly controlled use of silence and space, allowing story beats to land and sit with us. Few performers can hold a moment like he can, trusting in the narrative world and the relationship with the audience that he has crafted. And all from nothing but a story, a shared space, and a bit of time spent together.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/learning-to-fly\">Summerhall, Edinburgh</a>, until 28 August</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2022+tone/reviews\">All our Edinburgh reviews</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2022/aug/14/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T20:00:18Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/aug/14/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/aug/14/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","trailText":"Lightsource BP <strong>| </strong>Tim Newburn","byline":"Corrections and clarifications column editor","body":"<p>• We erred in including Lightsource BP in a graph detailing the profits and executive pay of energy firms that attended a meeting with Boris Johnson.

Williams was ranked No 1 with four grand-slam titles and already a hall‑of‑fame career when Raducanu was born.</p> \n<p>Before Williams’s name was drawn next to her, their most comprehensive interaction was the brief minutes they spent training on adjacent courts in Toronto last week before practice was almost immediately suspended because of rain, and a few brief greetings exchanged in the hallways.</p> \n<p>Raducanu said her most vivid memory of Williams was when she was whisked to Wimbledon with her coach and another young aspiring player when she was around seven years old.</p> \n<p>“I remember the highlight of my year was when I was young, at a tennis club, my first coach would take me and one other boy to Wimbledon on my day out. We’d take the tram there. We got on to Centre Court somehow and we watched her annihilate someone one and one. That was just really cool to see her live. That day out with my first coach, I was so excited for the day. I think that was a really special time in my life, a memory that I’ll always have.”</p> \n<p>After Dmitry Tursunov was unable to join her in Toronto because of pre-existing plans, Raducanu has resumed their trial partnership this week. On Saturday she and Tursunov continued their preparations as she trained with new Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, who herself is in the familiar position of adjusting to a life changing breakout grand slam title victory.</p> \n<p>As Tursunov provided continuous pointers, his relaxed demeanour contrasted starkly with the prickly interactions between Rybakina and her coach, Stefano Vukov. “He’s here, we’re continuing the trial,” Raducanu said. “It’s mainly, we just need to see how we work with each other, how we compliment each other. That’s it, I guess. It’s too early to tell.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/13/raducanu-a-perfect-fit-for-cameo-on-the-serena-williams-farewell-tour\">Raducanu a perfect fit for cameo on the Serena Williams farewell tour</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While she stresses that she is unbothered, it would certainly be understandable if this period comes with some heightened tension.

Time for a sit down and a nice cold drink. You know what? They say it’s going to rain on Tuesday. In the meantime Chelsea and Tottenham produced something extraordinary here. This was a steaming, throbbing mosh pit of a game, climate crisis football, pegged out around a series of flares. On and off the pitch, it was an afternoon defined by full-strength collisions.</p> \n<p>The most interesting of these was tactical, as Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea team produced 70 minutes of expert cover and team defence to smother the Tottenham attack; followed by a successful counter-tweak from Antonio Conte, and two late equalising goals. A 2-2 draw seemed just about fair, although Spurs will be happier with the point.</p> \n<p>The moment that will take the headlines was of course a different kind of collision, a hilariously overheated clash of middle-aged egos in the managerial rectangle. This reached its operatic peak after the final whistle, a moment of extreme alpha-handshake warfare as the standard clasp was transformed into a kind of death-shake face-off.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Kane snatches draw for Spurs at Chelsea as clashing Conte and Tuchel see red</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>No one will ever really know what happened inside that shake. The end result was Tuchel refusing to let go, sending Conte windmilling around – nobody windmills Antonio around – and inspiring a hair-raising tableau of waving arms, bumping chests, flashing eyes. like a Renaissance frieze entitled The Enragement of Antonio. Both managers were sent off. The only person who seemed to enjoy it was Tuchel’s ex-SAS bodyguard who loved every second – prowling expertly, eyes on swivel, securing the target.</p> \n<p>It had been coming. West London had been a heavy, draining place all day, a city turning a little sour and sullen in the dog days of late summer. Chelsea had already been angered by Tottenham’s first equaliser, as Rodrigo Bentancur had seemed to foul Kai Havertz perhaps half a minute before the ball went into the net.</p> \n<p>Chelsea went 2-1 up a little later, sending Tuchel off on his own wild, gawky, very funny sprint down the touchline, skinny arms pumping, legs pounding the turf, like a set of scaffolding poles bouncing off the back of a lorry. Tottenham’s second goal at the death, a header from Harry Kane, left Conte combination punching invisible orcs, a one-man Celtic war dance.</p> \n<p>A banner had been unfurled in the south stand before kick-off with the message “Welcome to the House of Fun”. And this really was fun. For all the necessary stuff about scenes nobody wants to see (they do) these two teams also produced a brilliant game of football, as those touchline collisions mirrored the tactical interplay between the two managers, the tightness of the game, the condensing of space, and Tuchel’s basic gameplan, which involved smothering the Spurs attack at source.</p> \n<p>A minute before half-time there was a telling moment as Kane picked up the ball in the centre circle, controlled it with a back-spun touch, and looked to turn and pass , but was instantly barged off his feet by Jorginho, then wrecked all over again by a full sliding challenge from Thiago Silva – the high point of a spell where Kane was buffeted about the pitch like an antique bookshelf being jimmied around a turn in the stairs by a particularly boisterous troupe of house movers.</p> \n<p>Chelsea did something more teams should do in that period: they got around Kane in his deep positions. N’Golo Kanté, Jorginho and Reece James were all brutally swift. Kane completed five passes in the opening 40 minutes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"230cb013527b4694ab80b13e179deef6ca5ac522\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/230cb013527b4694ab80b13e179deef6ca5ac522/0_109_3280_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Kane climbs highest to head home Spurs’ added-time equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Kane climbs highest to head home Spurs’ added-time equaliser.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Conte had gone with his first choice front three here, Kane-Son-Kulusevski, one to run, one to pass, one to glide about making up his own in-out target man schtick on the hoof. But Kane was stifled here by Kanté in particular, who looked fit again, won the ball high up the pitch and seemed to be playing with that old sense of a two-second glimpse into the future while everyone else is on delay.</p> \n<p>It was Kanté’s smart, spiky pressing that led to the corner that created Chelsea’s opening goal. On his touchline Tuchel turned and whooped, veins popping, fists clenched at his sides, like a man flying a jet pack through a lightning storm. He has a new look this season, less tracksuit manager, more history professor who also plays bass in a post-punk campus band.</p> \n<p>And the plan worked here for most of the game. In the opening 70 minutes Kane, Son, Kulusevski and Richarlison had one shot on target between them, and were dispossessed 15 times, six of those in the ledger next to Kane’s name. James showed exactly why he is the best defender England have, and scored Chelsea’s second after some fine team pressing.</p> \n<p>But Conte also had his say in that tactical crush. With 57 minutes gone he sent on Richarlison and rejigged his attack to a more standard 4-4-2, with Kane and Richarlison playing close together. Suddenly Spurs began to find space. Kane had some possession at last. For Chelsea that little knot of space invaders, the Kane squad, had either left the pitch or been thrown off by his position further up the pitch.</p> \n<p>Richarlison offered energy rather than edge. But he was also there next to Kane in stoppage time as an inswinging corner was glanced past Édouard Mendy to spark the final crush of this utterly gripping hot-box of a Premier League game.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/14/rafael-nadal-pays-tribute-to-serena-williams-on-return-to-court","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T19:29:12Z","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal pays tribute to Serena Williams on return to court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/14/rafael-nadal-pays-tribute-to-serena-williams-on-return-to-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/14/rafael-nadal-pays-tribute-to-serena-williams-on-return-to-court","fields":{"headline":"Rafael Nadal pays tribute to Serena Williams on return to court","trailText":"Rafael Nadal expressed his gratitude to ‘inspirational’ Serena Williams as he prepared to come back from a month-long injury absence","byline":"Tumaini Carayol","body":"<p>Rafael Nadal has expressed his gratitude towards Serena Williams for the inspiration and influence the American has provided throughout her years within tennis.</p> <p>“Plenty of memories,” Nadal said, smiling, before Williams’s imminent retirement from the game. “She is one of the greatest sports [people] of all time.

And no wonder. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/20/nick-drnaso-sabrina-graphic-novel-interview-extract\">Drnaso’s story</a>, about a missing woman and the effect her disappearance has on those close to her, deals with subjects many traditional novelists continue to be wary of tackling, gun control and conspiracy theories among them. Unlike many seemingly of-the-moment books, however, its power has only grown in the years since. Four years on and, following the US Capitol riots, it reads, at moments, like a prediction (Drnaso lives and works in Chicago). Go back to it, as I did the other day, and you will, I guarantee, find it at least twice as terrifying as you did the first time around.</p> <p>Thanks to this, my stomach lurched a bit when I picked up <em>Acting Class</em>, Drnaso’s first full-length outing since <em>Sabrina</em>. Is it as wildly successful as its predecessor? In truth, I’m not sure that it is. But my queasiness was hardly misplaced. In this book, Drnaso again distills quite brilliantly aspects of 21st-century anomie and alienation, on this occasion through the prism of a group of lonely and awkward strangers who sign up for an acting class run by a highly controlling but seemingly unqualified teacher called John Smith. Who is this mysterious guy? And why is this crowd – among its members are an anxious single mother and a bored married couple – so willing not only to trust him but to believe he is going to change their lives for the better? Drnaso’s narrative operates in the bewildering space between the reader’s instinctive scepticism – John stinks to high heaven of charlatanism – and the naivety and desperation of his crowd of misfits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"173f4ca66aaf3d3b6f18e9080c2254a91388fb7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/173f4ca66aaf3d3b6f18e9080c2254a91388fb7b/1854_353_1521_1762/863.jpg\" alt=\"A page from Acting Class by Nick Drnaso.\" width=\"863\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from Acting Class by Nick Drnaso.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Drnaso</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Acting Class</em> isn’t an easy read. Drnaso’s blank, Playmobil-ish faces are hard to tell apart; I sometimes struggled to work out which character was which. The way he presents the class’s improvisations as reality on the page can also be, to put it mildly, extremely confusing, as if two films have been suddenly spliced together. But perhaps this discomfiture is half of the point. In the age of social media, fantasy and reality are increasingly blurred; an addiction to the notion of self-help, Drnaso suggests, is born of exactly the same impulse that has people tweaking their personalities, and even their bodies, online, and why should we regard one as better (or worse) than the other? It’s all delusion. In 2022, artifice and authenticity are close to the same thing. Who could slip a paper between them?</p> <p>As for John, he is in some senses an Everyman figure: an all-purpose mountebank who might just as easily represent, in cultural terms, a certain kind of politician as a guru or cult leader. We know he’s making it up as he goes along. We know he’s preying on the deepest vulnerabilities of his class. Yet we can do nothing to stop him. Drnaso’s flat drawings, dun shades and slow-spooling scenarios are relentless and deliberately so. The crowd walks blindly towards this trickster, falling hungrily on his every exhortation. They believe only what they want to believe. Reality is inverted. The person who resists will be lonely indeed.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Acting Class</em> by Nick Drnaso is published by Granta on 18 August (£20).

Kingsley, a former coach, examined the formula and made her tweaks. We’ve always looked at crews that have got fantastic physicality,” she said.</p> <p>“But I guess where we’re heading now is that you can’t be top of the podium with just physicality. You’ve got to row well.</p> <p>“And that’s probably the trademark you’re starting to see with some of our crews. It’s the quality of their technical rowing that makes best use of their physiology. And that gives resilience. So you’ve got the psychological edge as well.”</p> <p>Craig and Grant were more than five seconds clear of their French rivals while the PR3 crew of Francesca Allen, Giedre Rakauskaite, Edward Fuller and Oli Stanhope routed the field by 19 seconds but narrowly missed a world-record time they had sought as a tribute to their cox, Erin Kennedy, who is stepping away to fight breast cancer.</p> <p>In the merciless world of British Cycling, Jack Carlin has been dubbed Long John Silver.

He was knighted in 2007 by the Queen, an event that led to protests in Iran and Pakistan.</p> <p><strong>Writing in the Guardian, Margaret Atwood said Rushdie had never missed an opportunity to speak out on behalf of the principles he had embodied in all his writing life.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Freedom of expression was foremost among these. Once a yawn-making liberal platitude, this concept has now become a hot-button issue, since the extreme right has attempted to kidnap it in the service of libel, lies, and hatred, and the extreme left has tried to toss it out the window in the service of their version of earthly perfection. It doesn’t take a crystal ball to foresee many panel discussions on the subject, should we reach a moment in which rational debate is possible. But whatever it is, the right to freedom of expression does not include the right to defame, to lie maliciously and damagingly about provable facts, to issue death threats, or to advocate murder. These should be punishable by law.</p> <p>As for those who are saying “Yes, but …” about Rushdie – some version of “He should have known better,” as in “Yes, too bad about the rape, but why was she wearing that revealing skirt” – I can only remark that there are no perfect victims. In fact, there are no perfect artists, nor is there any perfect art. Anti-censorship folks often find themselves having to defend work they would otherwise review scathingly, but such defences are necessary, unless we are all to have our vocal cords removed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Booker prize-winning author Ben Okri said the world had become less tolerant of nuance and disagreement.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We already live in a climate in which it is increasingly harder to express oneself freely. Now, this attack on Salman Rushdie, which many of us have feared for more than 30 years, has made creativity a matter of life and death. The internet has unleashed the monsters of trolling and hate speech. Death threats are issued to celebrities and to ordinary citizens expressing themselves on any number of issues.</p> <p>We have become less tolerant of nuance and disagreement. The atmosphere is more toxic than it has ever been. Yet it cannot be said strongly enough that a society cannot survive without free speech. Democracy is built on the right to dissent, on the right for people to hold opposing positions. Our societies need freedom of expression to protect us from the worst atrocities that governments can visit on their citizens.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Lisa Appignanesi, the British-Canadian writer and former president of the writers’ organisation English PEN, told Radio 4’s Today programme that The Satanic Verses would be seen as too controversial to be released today.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Satanic Verses certainly wouldn’t be [published]. There are a lot of fanatical religions in the world at the moment and no one knows where the greatest terror will come from next.</p> <p>Satanic Verses is a satire of Thatcher’s Britain, not of Islam. And a lot of things he describes are very much still with us, such as the tragedy of migrants and the extraordinary racism that still exists.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ian McEwan said the attack on his “dear friend” represented an assault on freedom of thought and speech.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are the freedoms that underpin all our rights and liberties. Salman has been an inspirational defender of persecuted writers and journalists across the world. He is a fiery and generous spirit, a man of immense talent and courage and he will not be deterred.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The former children’s laureate Michael Rosen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelRosenYes/status/1558321739523919872\">tweeted</a>:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Total condemnation for the deed and the spirit and politics behind it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The Scottish novelist AL Kennedy told the BBC World Service:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think [Rushdie’s] reaction to the fatwa was always very, very positive. It allowed him to understand even more that what you do is you keep writing and keep speaking and you keep doing a thing which is eternal. And you do it for as long as you’re able to.</p> <p>[Rushdie] is the opposite of silence. Writers are the opposite of silence. If you want us to be silent, you want us to be dead.</p> </blockquote>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
