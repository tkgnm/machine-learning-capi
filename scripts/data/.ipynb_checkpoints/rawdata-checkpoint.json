For this reason, it was difficult for national polls to predict that the Greens primary vote would be clustered enough to translate to the four lower house seats it could gain.</p> <p>Lewis said that individual seat polls \u2013 most of which were commissioned by candidates and parties \u2013 \u201clargely got it right\u201d, with several surveys toward the end of the campaign pointing to teal independent victories in Wentworth, Kooyong and Goldstein and tight contests in others.</p> <p>The small but significant primary vote for UAP in the lower house dispersed across the country, that was detected by polls, was seen in the senate, with the party on track to win an upper house seat in Victoria.</p> <p>Senate polling is rare in Australia, Goot said, in large part due to a lack of interest in the upper house in the context of media coverage of who will win government. He also said it was difficult to poll for, given the importance of preferences in deciding how the fifth and sixth seats (in states) are distributed.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId":

Watching the extraordinary outrage in Spain, with the press accusing the Frenchman of lacking class and La Liga branding the deal as \u201cscandalous\u201d, has raised eyebrows. But not as many as PSG being able to stump up a \u20ac200m-plus package for the world\u2019s best player \u2013 despite making a \u20ac224m loss last year.</p> \n<p>There are no good guys here, only a gnawing unease that the laws of economic gravity are being defied to the further detriment of the game we love. As La Liga put it in an unprecedented attack, the transfer showed that state-owned clubs, such as the Qatar-run PSG, \u201cdo not respect and do not want to respect the rules of a sector as important as football\u201d and that \u201csporting integrity\u201d was at stake.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/21/kylian-mbappe-decides-to-stay-at-psg-instead-of-joining-real-madrid\">Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 decides to stay at PSG instead of joining Real Madrid</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>They are big claims and La Liga has backed them up with a vow to file a complaint to Uefa and the EU. Yet Real Madrid are hardly paragons of virtue in this area. Last year they were central to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/22/on-standby-defiant-florentino-perez-insists-super-league-is-far-from-dead\" title=\"\">European Super League project</a>, which threatened the sporting integrity of European football far more than Mbapp\u00e9 staying with PSG. Recently they were also <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/barcelona-and-real-madrid-handed-multi-million-tax-bills-as-european-court-of-justice-issues-definitive-verdict-in-state-aid-case/\" title=\"\">one of four Spanish clubs ordered by the EU\u2019s highest court to pay back millions of euros</a> after it ruled they had benefited from state aid.</p> \n<p>PSG have privately brushed off La Liga\u2019s attacks, with one executive insisting to me that its \u20ac224m loss was allowed under the current Uefa financial fair play rules, which were loosened because of the pandemic. It is also understood that at a PSG board meeting this month it was revealed that Lionel Messi made the club \u20ac15m last season, even after all his costs were taken into account.</p> \n<p>The message was clear. Yes, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s deal is crazily expensive. But the club believe they can make that money back and abide by Uefa\u2019s new financial fair play rules that come into effect in 2025.</p> \n<p>Perhaps. But cynics will hope the rules are more robust than the previous incarnation, which proved easier to circumvent than the Maginot Line \u2013 with PSG and Manchester City among those found guilty. There are also well-founded fears that state-run clubs are creating inflationary pressures in the transfer market, while PSG\u2019s chief executive Nasser al-Khelaifi\u2019s enormous influence across Uefa and the European Club Association is also impossible to ignore.</p> \n<p>To my mind, though, the reaction to Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s new deal goes beyond the understandable squeamishness about sovereign wealth funds running clubs. It is also about how easy it is for the teams to entrench their advantage and ruin leagues. Would anyone bet against PSG, who have won eight of the past 10 Ligue 1 titles, winning next year? And the year after that? Or Bayern Munich, who have won 10 Bundesliga titles in a row, another procession?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"644cc8aa-ddbb-4eb9-8440-22bb6dd2c838\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zGZ4HUNDvXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of course there are exceptions \u2013 look at Manchester United. But while English football is certainly more unpredictable, as was seen again on a dramatic final day, Manchester City have still won four Premier League titles in five years and just eight clubs have finished in the top three in the past 25 years. Eight! \u2013 the same number as in the first five years of the Premier League between 1992-93 and 1996-97, when Norwich, Blackburn and Aston Villa all challenged for the title.</p> \n<p>Data from the website Sporting Intelligence, which tracks player salaries across multiple leagues and sports, shows there is a strong link between the amount a club spend on wages and where they finish in the table. But it does not have to be that way.</p> \n<p>In the US, where salary caps, luxury taxes and drafts for college players ensure that the major leagues are kept spicy and dicey, the difference is stark. Major League Baseball has had eight World Series winners in the past decade and five further teams finishing as runners-up. In other words, 13 of the MLB\u2019s 30 teams have fought for the sport\u2019s biggest prize in the past 10 years.</p> \n<p>In the NHL, meanwhile, 14 of the league\u2019s 32 clubs have played in a Stanley Cup final since 2012. In the NFL the figure is 13 out of 32, with some teams able to go from also\u2011rans to Super Bowl contenders within a couple of years.</p> \n<p>Curiously, though, that lack of football\u2019s competitive balance has not dented the game\u2019s popularity. One explanation, based on <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13571516.2015.1010282\" title=\"\">detailed analysis of the data by the economists Dr Babatunde Buraimo and Dr Rob Simmons</a>, is that TV audiences are far less interested in watching competitive matches than they once were \u2013 and instead they want the big names, regardless of the opposition.</p> \n<p>And there is no one bigger than Mbapp\u00e9 right now. According to one football executive I spoke to, the deal emphasises an even bigger shift in power in favour of players, more of whom are content to run down their contracts deliberately so they get all the money from a new deal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That executive also pointed out that it made sense for Mbapp\u00e9 to wait and play off PSG and Real Madrid. And also for PSG to pay a huge signing-on fee rather than have to sign another player from a competitor club.</p> \n<p>It is hard to argue with that.

And this cycle, Democrats have struggled to energize their base, deflated over the party\u2019s failure to pass Biden\u2019s sweeping agenda, designed to remedy longstanding economic challenges. At the same time, Democrats are struggling to persuade independent and moderate Republicans voters who recoiled from Donald Trump in 2018 and 2020.</p> <p>Whether Democrats can change voters\u2019 attitudes on the economy weighs heavily on their prospects.</p> <p>Public opinion surveys have consistently found that voters have more trust in Republicans to handle the economy and inflation than Democrats. A recent <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p-jELdZ5sqw50I2ntbA-x46wIMR1fvCua-sJREjPZjQ/edit#gid=0\">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a> found that only 28% of Americans approved of the job Biden was doing to tackle inflation, while 68% disapproved.

It found that the proposal, when described as a plan that would \u201craise taxes\u201d on millions of working-class families and potentially threaten entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, was deeply unpopular, even among Republican voters. And when contrasted with the Democrats\u2019 economic agenda, voters\u2019 views of Biden and his party on the economy improved.</p> <p>Isaiah Bailey, an advisor to Navigator Research, said it was incumbent on Democrats to make voters aware of these dueling visions for the country.</p> <p>\u201cUnpopular positions are only politically meaningful when they permeate public consciousness,\u201d Bailey said. He added that Democrats must demonstrate that they are trying to deliver on their promises, even in the face of Republican opposition and procedural challenges like the filibuster.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrats really need to look like fighters,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Maria Cardona, a veteran Democratic strategist who has urged her party\u2019s leaders to<a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3459700-democrats-must-feel-voters-pain-on-inflation/\"> talk more</a> about the economy with more urgency and empathy, agreed.</p> <p>\u201cFor way too long Republicans have gotten away with blaming Democrats, pointing the finger and talking about Biden\u2019s policies,\u201d she said.</p> <p>With so much at stake this fall, including the push to ban abortion if the supreme court overturns Roe v Wade, as is expected, Cardona said it was imperative that Democrats draw a clear contrast with the opposition party.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that we are not taking advantage of the moment in time, when handing over control of Congress to the Republican party is more dangerous for the future of our democracy and for the well-being of our citizenship than it has been in at least a generation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Surveys suggest that voters broadly understand \u2013 and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-biden-business-congress-dca6b1eba4979bcec8bef1a80c9f0098\">support</a> \u2013 the decision to impose sanctions on Russia, even if there are consequences for their pocketbooks.

The Moroccan-born, New York-based artist had been granted a green card, and was now a lawful, permanent resident of the US. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d she says over a glass of sparkling water in a bar close to Nottingham Contemporary, the gallery where she is installing Life on the Caps, her new video exhibition. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m grateful.

In the films, teleportation has replaced air travel. Would-be illegal immigrants to the US are intercepted as they attempt to zap across the Atlantic, and interned in the camp, which has developed from an insular holding pen to a sprawling migrant settlement and Latin quarter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The animation in Mary Poppins blew me away!

In Fly, an animated fruit fly guides viewers around the private lives of citizens in Rabat and Fez. In Mission Teens, Bennani appeared as a CGI donkey, shooting footage of real-life, snotty teens at elite, French-speaking schools in Rabat. And in 2 Lizards, Bennani and her flatmate \u2013 fellow animator Orian Barki \u2013 cast themselves as languid talking reptiles, trying to make the best of life in lockdown Manhattan.</p> <p>This work, which the animators posted on Instagram, became a pandemic hit, and led to more commercial inquiries. \u201cWe developed a TV show, but it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Bennani explains. \u201cIt was too mainstream for the art world, but too weird for Hollywood.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m quite bored by the art world.

Even before its endless memeability became apparent it was as much a fixture of popular culture as of art history. But there has always been more to Munch than his most famous work, and a <a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/edvard-munch-masterpieces-from-bergen/\" title=\"\">new show at London\u2019s Courtauld Gallery</a> gives a rare chance to trace his wider career.</p> <p>The exhibition comes from the collection of Norwegian industrialist Rasmus Meyer, who discovered Munch\u2019s work in the early years of the 20th century and soon became an avid supporter and collector, going on to buy paintings directly from Munch\u2019s studio, the paint almost still wet, as the saying goes. This is the first time his collection, held in the <a href=\"https://kodebergen.no/en\" title=\"\">Kode art museum</a> in Bergen, has been shown together outside Scandinavia. It takes work from the 1880s, when Munch was the rising star of Norwegian art, through his \u201cgolden decade\u201d of the 1890s \u2013 when he developed his characteristic style and produced what became known as his <a href=\"https://munch.emuseum.com/collections/41719/livsfrisemotiver\" title=\"\">The Frieze of Life</a> series, including various iterations of The Scream \u2013 and into the 20th century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine\u2019s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNorway had only really begun to crystallise as an independent nation at the end of the 19th century,\u201d explains Courtauld curator Barnaby Wright, \u201cand Meyer wanted to put together a collection of Norwegian art that would say something powerful about their culture and identity.\u201d Not that Munch\u2019s work was universally appreciated in 19th-century Norway. While he was attaining international recognition, disputes between conservative and avant-garde opinion played out in similar ways as they had with French impressionism in the 1870s.</p> <p>The layout of the Courtauld, passing through their stellar collection of impressionist and post-impressionist art on the way to the exhibition space, is fortuitously suited to this show. Munch had been fascinated by the impressionists\u2019 exploration of the effects of light, and new techniques for capturing them, but the lessons he took were then deployed for his own purposes. Rather than following Monet in taking his canvas outdoors to nature, Munch was more interested in painting from memory and out of his imagination, using light in a far more expressive and symbolic way.</p> <p>By the 1890s he had developed this style of painting, employing richer and moodier colours to conjure an atmosphere of anxiety in which figures and landscapes increasingly reflected one another. He named these explorations The Frieze of Life, and \u201chis ambition was to cover a spectrum of the most profound human emotions and experiences\u201d, explains Wright. \u201cOften drawing on his own memories from childhood; the loss of loved ones; torturous relationships with women. What makes these pictures endure is the complexity and multiplicity of feelings and emotions he evokes. However great The Scream is, it is just one example of Munch\u2019s extraordinary output. This collection shows why so many of his pictures still speak so powerfully to us.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Morbidity, death and precarious anxiety\u2019: four key works from the exhibition</h2> <p><strong>Evening on Karl Johan Street (1892, main picture)<br></strong>Light plays a critical role in all of Munch\u2019s work, and here he captures the creative possibilities of a strange moonlight mixed with gaslight. Evening on Karl Johan Street is a key Frieze of Life picture and the first time Munch used those skeletal faces that loom out of the canvas, which he repeated in his Scream paintings. This is the origin picture for that now famous visual device.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aaf06b15c58e5b72874f09700afa3326eb235d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aaf06b15c58e5b72874f09700afa3326eb235d2/422_41_7628_7623/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Self-Portrait in the Clinic, 1909, by Edvard Munch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-Portrait in the Clinic, 1909, by Edvard Munch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dag Fosse/KODE Bergen Art Museum/The Rasmus Meyer Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Self-Portrait in the Clinic (1909)<br></strong>When Munch had a nervous breakdown he sought treatment at a clinic in Copenhagen. His life had been lived at an intense pitch. When Munch was a child, his father was zealously religious, and an air of morbidity and death hung over the family. It clung to Munch for the rest of his life and it was this sense of precarious anxiety that fed into his art. This particular work has an interesting parallel with Van Gogh\u2019s self-portraits after his severe mental episodes in depicting a man and an artist attempting to rebuild himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e15b5b314d24acdb6a5d80b9c1a7804b177edb44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e15b5b314d24acdb6a5d80b9c1a7804b177edb44/129_200_8253_6802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children Playing in the Street in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand, 1901-1903, by Edvard Munch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"824\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children Playing in the Street in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand, 1901-1903, by Edvard Munch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dag Fosse/KODE Bergen Art Museum/The Rasmus Meyer Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Children Playing in the Street in A\u030asga\u030ardstrand (1901\u201303)<br></strong>Munch spent many of his summers in the small coastal fishing town of A\u030asga\u030ardstrand. Here, he takes a seemingly mundane everyday activity and turns it into something more profound. Are the boys taunting the young girl, looking at her as an object of desire or just playing?

What he offers is metronomic reliability and a teak-tough mentality: how the Ukrainian has performed so superbly during the harrowing invasion of his homeland by Russia is admirable. <strong>9</strong></p> \n<h2>Jo\u00e3o Cancelo</h2> \n<p>In a group studded with quality the Portuguese occupies the highest echelon. From full-back (mainly the left flank) Cancelo is a creative force with an eye for a pass and his geometric awareness of traffic and space is Toni Kroos-like. If Cancelo can be caught out via a quick counterattack this is a byproduct of City\u2019s high line. <strong>9</strong></p> \n<h2>Aymeric Laporte</h2> \n<p>As with all City\u2019s centre-backs Laporte <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/30/manchester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">lacks speed when having to turn</a>.

Even R\u00faben Dias\u2019s recent injuries have taken Stones to only 12 league starts (his lowest for the club) and the mystery is what Laporte did so right in last summer\u2019s close season to move from defender non grata to again enjoying Guardiola\u2019s supreme confidence. <strong>7</strong></p> \n<h2>R\u00faben Dias</h2> \n<p>The de facto captain who wore the armband in Fernandinho\u2019s (near permanent) absence is admired by Guardiola for his professionalism. Dias can be cumbersome in control and occasionally shaky under high balls but he has, again, been as vital as in his debut season. <strong>9</strong></p> \n<h2>Fernandinho</h2> \n<p>Cometh the hour, cometh the Fernandinho. City\u2019s late-season slew of stricken defenders \u2013 Dias, Nathan Ak\u00e9, Laporte, Walker \u2013 has cleared the way for a swansong from Guardiola\u2019s favourite squad member, who departs in the summer after nine years and five titles. <strong>7</strong></p> \n<h2>Rodri</h2> \n<p>The oil in a super-slick machine. The phrase \u201cpass-and-go\u201d might be tattooed on an arm of the Spaniard so astute is he at the occupation of the half-yard needed to receive and distribute the ball. In Guardiola\u2019s ever-unpredictable game of team selection the 25-year-old is a constant after mystifyingly being dropped for last May\u2019s Champions League final. <strong>9</strong></p> \n<h2>Riyad Mahrez</h2> \n<p>Only 15 league starts (plus 13 substitute appearances) seems low for a wide man Guardiola likes to trust for the bigger contests (Mahrez played in all 12 Champions League matches). From the Algerian who loves bamboozling defenders, gliding towards goal and unloading or teeing up a teammate, this makes his 11 league strikes even more impressive. <strong>9</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6517ed4f719d0aa446bff5ba17d1a45d255dbaf4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6517ed4f719d0aa446bff5ba17d1a45d255dbaf4/114_0_3610_2167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riyad Mahrez scores the vital opener in April\u2019s win over Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riyad Mahrez scores the vital opener in April\u2019s win over Brighton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magi Haroun/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Bernardo Silva</h2> \n<p>A diminutive magician whose perma-grin hides his ruthlessness with opponents and how easy the game is for him. Who at Villa Park in early December will forget the way Silva finished a symphonic back-to-front move with the purest of volleys that was a moment of art <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/01/aston-villa-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">amid a frantic contest</a>? <strong>10</strong></p> \n<h2>Kevin De Bruyne </h2> \n<p>The 2021-22 vintage has been, to this witness, the finest of De Bruyne as the imperious Belgian\u2019s answer to serious injury and Covid at the beginning of the season was to become City\u2019s headline act precisely when required: at the business end of the title defence. The 30-year-old has 15 goals \u2013 eight since March \u2013 in 25 starts. Factor in vision, laser-like passing, relentless work rate and an endearing nonchalance and this is a bona fide total footballer. City\u2019s player of the season. <strong>10</strong></p> \n<h2>Phil Foden</h2> \n<p>Nine goals and five assists in 24 starts may feel under-par for a sparkling talent who is still only 21. But factor in how he can operate across attack and in midfield and how Guardiola often plumps for him as the false 9 and a richer understanding is allowed of a footballer whose ability to dazzle can suck the air from any onlooker. <strong>8</strong></p> \n<h2>Raheem Sterling</h2> \n<p>Has 13 goals to the 10 of last term when he lost his place for the campaign\u2019s final phase. An undesired penchant for missing chances remains but Sterling can be a game-winner who this season has reverted to the driving-at-defenders forward of his earlier days at City. <strong>8</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"884bdc35d13cc8c866c89a1e699f6f9ca449a5b6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/884bdc35d13cc8c866c89a1e699f6f9ca449a5b6/0_0_4959_3494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raheem Sterling scores a penalty against Leicester in December 2021\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Sterling scores a penalty against Leicester in December.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt McNulty/Manchester City FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Jack Grealish</h2> \n<p>Three goals is a paltry tally from a footballer whose shimmying, angled wing-play offers a different dimension. A truism runs that a player in his second season under Guardiola often improves because of a better understanding of the manager\u2019s demands and team patterns. For the \u00a3100m British record signing, then, it is roll on 2022-23. <strong>7</strong></p> \n<h2>Ilkay G\u00fcndogan</h2> \n<p>Will Sunday\u2019s hero still be at City next season? He has 12 months left on his terms and at 31 may depart for more match time. This year his numbers have dipped \u2013 27 appearances, seven as a replacement, for eight goals, down from 13 strikes in 28 (five as a substitute) last term \u2013 yet Guardiola trusts G\u00fcndogan so will not wish to lose the German, who delivered dramatically on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/manchester-city-win-premier-league-title-aston-villa-match-report\">final day to give City the title</a>. <strong>8</strong></p> \n<h2>Gabriel Jesus</h2> \n<p>Eight goals from a player signed as a centre-forward is far too low and continues a pattern: in six seasons the Brazilian has managed double figures only twice, registering a high of 14 in 2019-20 and 13 two years before. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/erling-haaland-pep-guardiola-manchester-city\">purchase of Erling Haaland</a> and last summer\u2019s pursuit of the equally prolific

Nobody I knew went to university so that wasn\u2019t something I even thought about. Where I grew up, the choices seemed to be: deal drugs, work for the nearby car plant or somehow use sport as a way out \u2013 although I was also told by one teacher I was more likely to be dead by 25 than be a professional footballer. When the expectations are that low, and you\u2019re told for so many years \u201cyou can\u2019t\u201d, you start to believe it. And then when I was 15 I was excluded from school, leaving without any GCSEs, just another of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/24/exclusion-rates-black-caribbean-pupils-england\">disproportionately high number</a> of mixed race and Black Caribbean boys to be removed from school.</p> <p>I did become a professional footballer, joining a non-league side when I was working as a bricklayer and eventually joining Watford in 2010, and I\u2019ve seen the power of using my platform and making a stand when my colleagues and I took the knee in the wake of the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> to support Black Lives Matter. Football was my way out, but I also wonder what I could have done if I\u2019d been encouraged to engage at school and seen myself reflected in what I was learning \u2013 and how life might have been different for all the other kids who didn\u2019t have football.</p> <p>This is why I have started to campaign for schools to better represent their students, with a diverse curriculum that covers Black, Asian and minority ethnic history and experiences. Instead of it being relegated to Black History Month, which feels to me like a token gesture, the history and contributions of people of colour should be considered part of British history and embedded and mandated throughout the curriculum.</p> <p>It is history that shapes our society today, and for children from ethnic minorities, it also shapes our identity. My memories of Black history at school was learning about slavery and the civil rights movement \u2013 vitally important subjects, but when that\u2019s all you learn, it reinforces the idea that Black people were considered <em>less than </em>white people.</p> <p>What about all the positive ways Black people have contributed to society? Where are the inventors, writers, artists and leaders? I enjoyed maths, and was good at it, but it never occurred to me that I could do something with it because I didn\u2019t learn about scientists or mathematicians who looked like me. How many people know that the traffic light was invented by the prolific Black inventor, <a href=\"https://www.black-inventor.com/garrett-morgan\">Garrett A Morgan</a>? Something as simple as that could be so uplifting to a generation of kids who might think: I could be an inventor as well.</p> <p>In September, Wales will make the teaching of a diverse curriculum mandatory, so there is a template of how we can do that without removing anything and at no additional heavy cost. I\u2019d like to see the rest of the UK follow. I started a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/nadhimzahawi-make-the-teaching-of-bame-histories-and-experiences-mandatory-across-the-school-curriculum?recruiter=1253829699&amp;recruited_by_id=23eb28e0-8ffb-11ec-b581-a759d9858d41&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_content=cl_sharecopy_32393430_en-GB%3A4\">petition</a>, and I\u2019ve had talks with Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, but progress is slow.</p> <p>Despite the outpouring of support for the Black Lives Matter movement to mandate a more inclusive curriculum, little action has been taken so far. The idea seems to make some people uncomfortable \u2013 from the politicians who refuse to embrace it to the racist abuse I get daily on social media \u2013 perhaps because exploring the history and experiences of people of colour, and particularly Black British history, will highlight that Great Britain isn\u2019t as great in all aspects as we think.</p> <p>The pushback isn\u2019t coming from teachers though. According to YouGov research I commissioned, 80% of primary and secondary school teachers surveyed believe that diverse and representative topics are vital and enriching for all students. But only 12% said they felt \u201cempowered\u201d to teach \u201coptional\u201d topics such as colonialism and migration, which destroys the government\u2019s argument that Black history is available to teach within the current national curriculum.</p> <p>We live in a cancel culture, and I think this worries teachers, most of whom are <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/school-teacher-workforce/latest\">white</a>, who are wary of saying the wrong thing (and of course I\u2019d like to see many more Black teachers). It\u2019s why I love the work of organisations like <a href=\"https://theblackcurriculum.com/\">The Black Curriculum</a>, run by Lavinya Stennett, who go into schools and help teachers with training.</p> <p>Had I been given more knowledge about my heritage at school, I would have understood so much more about myself and my family \u2013 I could have had more understanding for my grandad, part of the Windrush generation who arrived in the UK and worked hard for the Royal Mail for 30 years. But I\u2019m from a generation, just as he was, where people didn\u2019t talk about it. If I\u2019d had more empathy for his experience, I would have known why he seemed miserable a lot of the time.</p> <p>What I\u2019ve seen is that teaching diverse history sparks conversation. In the Channel 4 documentary I\u2019ve made, students at Harris City Academy in south London, the first secondary school to sign up to The Black Curriculum\u2019s teaching methods, told me it opened up a space where they could have difficult conversations. Race can be an uncomfortable topic for some people, but until we have more conversations that are uncomfortable, we\u2019re never going to get comfortable with the situation. I saw students who were engaged, had a wide understanding of the world, a pride in their own heritage and who felt inspired about their future. That\u2019s what I want for all children.</p> <ul> <li><p>Troy Deeney is captain of Birmingham FC and an anti-racism campaigner.

After a leaked draft opinion went viral suggesting the supreme court\u2019s intention to overturn Roe v Wade \u2013 the landmark decision that <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-is-roe-v-wade\">established a constitutional right to abortion</a> in the US \u2013 Cuellar has faced renewed scrutiny from reproductive rights champions as <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/03/henry-cuellar-jessica-cisneros-texas-aboriton-roe-wade/\">the lone Democratic representative</a> to vote against codifying the right to an abortion last September.</p> <p>Cisneros, in turn, has vowed to protect that right. In a statement following the draft leak, she <a href=\"https://thehill.com/news/campaign/3476893-cisneros-calls-on-house-leadership-to-retract-support-for-cuellar-over-abortion-stance/\">called on the Democratic leadership</a> \u201cto withdraw their support of Henry Cuellar who is the last anti-choice Democrat in the House\u201d.</p> <p>The 2022 election is Cisneros\u2019s second bid to unseat Cuellar, whom she also ran against in 2020 as a first-time, 26-year-old challenger. After she lost that race <a href=\"https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2020/primary-election-results/\">by less than 4% of the vote</a>, she said she felt compelled to try one more time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b966ecde112d09e42cc213ad7513e0fd07f5be8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b966ecde112d09e42cc213ad7513e0fd07f5be8/0_70_2115_1269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cisneros and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a rally in San Antonio in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cisneros and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a rally in San Antonio in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat folks were telling us over and over and over again was that, you know, the way things are right now isn\u2019t working, and that they want a different version \u2013 an alternative version \u2013 of what south Texas can look like, because they felt like they were being taken for granted,\u201d Cisneros said.</p> <p>Residents in Texas-28 have a lot working against them, which may explain why some could feel like they and their votes are undervalued. For one, increased voter restrictions, closed or relocated polling places, and other serious barriers that require more time and energy make it so that by design, many Texans of color don\u2019t vote when they perceive an election to be low stakes.</p> <p>\u201cEverything we see looks to be orchestrated in a way that makes voting for Latinos hard and almost impossible,\u201d said Nishikawa Ch\u00e1vez, who suggested it was hard to look at the Texas government\u2019s actions and not recognize a systemic interest in suppressing the Latino vote.</p> <p>In a self-fulfilling prophecy, candidates from both parties also chronically underinvest their limited resources in Latino communities like Texas-28 because they don\u2019t know how to reach them and assume they probably won\u2019t go to the polls, Nishikawa Ch\u00e1vez said.</p> <p>Jen Ramos, a state Democratic executive committeewoman for the Texas Democratic party, has been getting out the vote for Cisneros in Laredo and San Antonio, where some residents have told her it\u2019s the first time their doors have ever been knocked by a political campaign.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that these folks have never had their door knocked on, have never been contacted before, and we\u2019re talking to people and meeting them where they\u2019re at, that\u2019s a real disappointment for an elected official who\u2019s been in office for as long as he [Cuellar] has,\u201d Ramos said.</p> <p>If there was anything Ramos noticed growing up in Texas-28, it was the defeated feeling that nothing ever changed within her community, no matter who was in power. \u201cHenry Cuellar has been in office almost as long as I\u2019ve been alive, and yet nothing has inspired any change or difference, nor has he ever bothered to talk to anybody in the community,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She\u2019s optimistic that things could finally be different with Cisneros representing the district: \u201cI think that Jessica\u2019s race is the very first time in a long time that the region and the community has seen the sense of hope.\u201d</p> <p>But not everyone in the district agrees with the kind of change Cisneros represents. Texas-28 is a perfect microcosm of how Latino voters are in no way a monolith, and closer to the border\u2019s Rio Grande, constituents trend more conservative, Catholic and pro-gun rights than in San Antonio\u2019s working-class neighborhoods, Nishikawa Ch\u00e1vez explained.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge district, and it\u2019s cut in such a way to maximize Republican votes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you get a kind of a schizophrenic area.\u201d</p> <p>Generational and gendered divides complicate matters further. Older voters speak Cuellar\u2019s language around good jobs, border security and Catholic values, while a growing constituency of highly educated young Latinos hear their values represented in Cisneros. Meanwhile, Latina matriarchs are pushing their communities to vote for issues beyond the economy, such as healthcare access, the environment and quality education.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46ea15b268e526fe5aeb9118d1dda03fcd1ae775\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46ea15b268e526fe5aeb9118d1dda03fcd1ae775/0_335_5370_3222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, with Cuellar at a campaign event in San Antonio on 4 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, with Cuellar at a campaign event in San Antonio on 4 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Gay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, the runoff will come down to who actually turns out, a question that may have a larger impact on how politicians appeal to Latinos in future, Nishikawa Ch\u00e1vez suggested.</p> <p>\u201cHow this election goes is going to tell us a little bit about the future, about how to approach or how to campaign and to get the votes of \u2026 Latino voters in the US,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For now, Cisneros is hoping to find common ground with her neighbors across the district by listening to what they want addressed. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about increasing the minimum wage and Medicare for All,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re kitchen-table issues that, you know, people are much more concerned about.</p> <p>\u201cChange doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d Cisneros added. \u201cEvery little thing that we\u2019re doing every single day, I mean, is helping us build a brighter future.

It unfolds in the wake of seven allegations of sexual misconduct against a female academic\u2019s husband, John (another professor at the same college), triggering, in turn, a slew of student signatures calling for his removal. The supposed \u201cmadness\u201d of the novel lies not only in the whipped-up condemnation of John, but in the narrator\u2019s slippery descent into her own murky infatuation.</p> <p>The arrival of debut author Vladimir, a suave, second-generation Russian, \u201cclearly a transplant from the city\u201d, as a professor amid this wreckage spells further disaster for the unnamed narrator, whose wry and shrewd voice steers this novel. Creating a quartet of entanglements, Vladimir brings wife Cynthia (and young daughter) in tow, whose deep, unexplained trauma and \u201chonourable depression\u201d elevates her in our narrator\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>While privately confessing to her husband\u2019s flings with students \u2013 and her own indifference (\u201cpower is the reason they desired him in the first place\u201d) \u2013 the protagonist first feels a spark between herself and Vladimir. Fifty-eight years old and railing against her perceived loss of sexual power, the narrator\u2019s desire for a father in his 40s plummets her into \u201ca pit, with no bottom\u201d. Rapt with longing and inspiration, she resumes her dormant, so far unsuccessful work as a novelist and, in a sardonic subversion of the male author and his muse, becomes \u201cengorged with the creative juice\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jonas portrays a world in which women, despite attempts to unshackle themselves, trip into knotty and constricting gender norms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Vladimir</em> is peppered with subversions of this kind, from the narrator\u2019s early assertion that \u201cperhaps I <em>am</em> an old man more than I am an oldish white woman\u201d, since she is compelled by desire, to the introduction of her adult, androgynous, bisexual daughter Sid, emancipated from \u201cthe heterosexual prison\u201d. Yet Jonas portrays a world in which women, despite attempts to unshackle themselves, trip into knotty and constricting gender norms: though priding herself on an \u201cunconventional\u201d marriage, the narrator is engulfed by domestic labour, while it is her own body, not Vladimir\u2019s, and its faults with which she is preoccupied (the \u201clines in places I had yet to realise\u201d, breasts \u201cmore comical than globular, and which now, on a bad day, looked nearly phallic\u201d). Jonas, a playwright, artfully fashions a protagonist mired in contradictions that stack up as the narrative progresses.</p> <p>The novel is hemmed in by its central questions: the narrator\u2019s complicity in her husband\u2019s affairs, having initially \u201csuggested to John that he seek out other women\u201d (a late symptom of the free love movement that now backfires), as well as how consensual these relationships were. Arguments of female agency, sex positivity and what constitutes true trauma are wrung dry \u2013 it is the topic of female pain and its fetishisation in art, however, which Jonas illuminates. Among the novel\u2019s most disturbing passages are the narrator\u2019s recollected encounters with predatory professors and family friends, dismissed as little more than embarrassing.</p> <p>With its fervent \u201cembrace\u201d of \u201cthe I I I\u201d, its understated mundanity and poised restraint, Jonas\u2019s debut joins a swath of authors with nameless protagonists, among them Rachel Cusk and Amina Cain, and their interrogation of the female canon. There\u2019s a moroseness in the vein of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/04/ottessa-moshfegh-interview-granta-short-story\">Ottessa Moshfegh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/13/lisa-taddeo-i-am-angry-at-my-history-of-apology\">Lisa Taddeo</a> with which <em>Vladimir</em> dissects the boomer-millennial generational divide, shifting sexual politics and the changing constraints on language used by women \u2013 though what lets this intelligent, knowing portrayal of a woman\u2019s spiralling midlife crisis down is that the questions it seeks to answer are not as morally dubious as it seems to claim. The much-overstated 15-year age gap between Vladimir and the narrator is characteristic of the novel\u2019s concern about age-related power dynamics; <em>Vladimir</em> is snagged on whether the assumption that young women cannot consent to relationships with older men is anti-feminist, though its stilted attempt to give the title of victim or oppressor to each is where the novel loses its footing.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Vladimir</em> by Julia May Jonas is published by Picador (\u00a312.99).

It\u2019s a sad enough event as it is, so let\u2019s have some really hard French house. Actually, I\u2019ll put it in print now: I want Daft Punk to play at my funeral. With the pyramid!

Not only is it a really horrific song, every time I\u2019ve heard it, something bad has happened. I remember it playing in the car when I was 14 and thinking: \u201cWhat is this awful song? Surely this isn\u2019t the man who played Layla?\u201d Then, the next day, my grandfather died. After that, every time I\u2019ve heard it, something\u2019s made me feel upset. I can\u2019t give you an example, you\u2019ll just have to take my word for it. So it\u2019s become a bit of a jinx, as well as being awful. I can\u2019t bear that record.</p> <p><strong>The song I pretend to hate that I secretly like<br></strong>I haven\u2019t openly claimed to dislike it, but I was obsessed with Believe by Cher. It was the first time anyone heard Auto-Tune modulate a voice. I just remember thinking: I probably shouldn\u2019t like this, but I really, really love it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfvcPeWO8yk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MfvcPeWO8yk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>The song I tell people is my favourite<br></strong>You Don\u2019t Know How Lucky You Are by Keaton Henson. It\u2019s an absolutely beautiful song, and I love it, and it\u2019s also a good song to say is your favourite because most people don\u2019t know it and it makes you sound really cool.</p> <p><strong>My actual favourite song<br></strong>Open by the Cure. The Cure are one of my favourite bands and that song is all about being at a party they didn\u2019t want to be at. That resonates with me much more. In my career I\u2019ve been to lots of parties that I wanted to leave, and Robert Smith sings about that so evocatively. I\u2019m the guy in the kitchen listening to nu-disco.

He says it doesn\u2019t matter as we are married so if he dies I will get it and if we divorce I will get half.<br><br>I\u2019m currently on maternity leave so not earning but when I was at work, I did pay towards the mortgage each month. However, I don\u2019t earn as much as him so before I was only able to contribute a small amount towards the mortgage.<br><br>He says because I have a flat I bought with a friend some years ago making me a joint owner would create an issue with stamp duty and also I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a mortgage so he will leave my name out on the application.<br><br>This doesn\u2019t make me feel comfortable. Am I protected? Or \u2013 if not \u2013 how can I protect myself? My husband says that when I am able to sell my flat can I put my name on the house but won\u2019t there be fees to pay to do that?<br><strong>BY</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I have some bad news for your husband: even if you aren\u2019t named as joint owner on the new house your flat could still have an impact on the rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT) you are charged in England because the tax system treats a married couple or civil partnership as one unit.</p> <p> The good news is that if, as I assume you are, the house you plan to buy is replacing the \u201cmain residence\u201d you currently live in, you won\u2019t have to pay the higher rate of SDLT despite owning two properties as a couple. The same is true under the rules in Scotland.</p> <p>So being named as a joint owner doesn\u2019t make any difference to the amount of SDLT that has to be paid in this case. But it potentially makes a big difference to what you would get in the event of your husband\u2019s death.</p> <p>If you were made joint tenants, you would automatically get the whole house on his death. If you were named as tenants in common \u2013 so you each owned a distinct share in the house \u2013 you would get to keep your share but you\u2019d only get your husband\u2019s share if he left it to you in his will. This would also be the case if the house was in his sole name so you are right to worry about not being protected.</p> <p>What you would get on divorce depends on the financial agreement you make at that point, and you wouldn\u2019t automatically get half.</p> <p>Rather than waiting until you have sold your flat, it would be better to become a joint owner \u2013 and preferably as joint tenants \u2013 from the date of purchase. Doing this would also be cheaper than putting your name on the property at a later date, as there would be fees to pay.</p> <p>As far as not being able to get a mortgage while on maternity leave goes, your husband is talking twaddle. According to Pete Mugleston, a mortgage adviser at onlinemortgageadvisor.co.uk, while \u201cmaternity leave may be a time of financial uncertainty, despite what you might have heard to the contrary, it is possible to get a mortgage while you are on it\u201d. However rather than approaching mainstream mortgage lenders directly, it would be easier to find an amenable lender with the help of an independent mortgage adviser. </p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "society/2022/may/23/hepatitis-cases-children-rising", "type": "article", "sectionId": "society", "sectionName": "Society", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-23T06:00:10Z", "webTitle": "Hepatitis cases rising among children globally but cause remains a mystery", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/23/hepatitis-cases-children-rising", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/23/hepatitis-cases-children-rising", "fields": {"headline": "Hepatitis cases rising among children globally but cause remains a mystery", "trailText": "Researchers are investigating possible links to Covid-19, which has already been shown to cause liver problems in some patients", "body": "<p>A dangerous and mysterious illness continues to spread among children, and so do questions over what\u2019s causing it, including possible links to Covid-19.

Normally the UK has eight to 10 liver transplants each year, but is has already <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/05/17/hepatitis-children-investigation-cause/\">passed</a> those numbers, with 11 in only three months.</p> <p>Globally, <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/documents/acute-severe-hepatitis-unknown-origin-children-10-may-2022\">26 patients</a> \u2013 15 in the US \u2013 have required liver transplants. Nearly half of the deaths \u2013 five out of 11 so far \u2013 have occurred in the US, although the nation accounts for only one-third of identified cases.</p> <p>The first cases in the US were reported in Alabama, but after the CDC issued a nationwide alert, cases were found in 36 states and territories.</p> <p>Blood tests reveal the severe liver inflammation isn\u2019t caused by the usual culprits, including the hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E.</p> <p>Several possible causes are being investigated. This could be a new virus that hasn\u2019t yet been unidentified. Or it could be an existing virus, or existing viruses grouped together, causing new symptoms.</p> <p>One of the top viruses under consideration is adenovirus, a common family of viruses detected in the bloodstreams of many patients \u2013 especially the variant 41, which usually presents as a stomach bug. But the liver tissues that have been examined so far don\u2019t show signs of adenovirus, and it\u2019s unusual for this virus to cause hepatitis.</p> <p>It\u2019s not unheard-of to discover rare effects from common viruses. In 2012, another common virus, an enterovirus, was found to cause a very rare condition known as <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.24730\">acute flaccid myelitis</a>. These very rare conditions emerge when there is a high rate of cases, which could be the case with adenovirus \u2013 UK health officials, who track the virus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/ten-uk-children-require-transplant-amid-surge-in-hepatitis-cases\">found</a> a five-year high of cases in young children this winter.</p> <p>Another cause could be long-term effects from Sars-CoV-2. In some cases, the children with hepatitis tested positive for Covid, but in others, there was no documented history of a Covid infection.</p> <p>Covid infections have been widespread in children, and many of the patients are too young to be vaccinated against Covid. The CDC estimates that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7117e3.htm?s_cid=mm7117e3_e&amp;ACSTrackingID[%E2%80%A6].%2071%2C%20April%2026%2C%202022&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM80513\">75%</a> of American children have had the virus.</p> <p>There are already links between Covid and liver problems.

Out of 475 children who tested positive, 37 had symptoms of hepatitis \u2013 and they recovered well with treatment.</p> <p>Another large new preprint <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.10.22274866v1\">study</a> compared the liver function of thousands of children who tested positive for Covid with kids who had other respiratory illnesses.</p> <p>\u201cChildren with Covid have a significantly higher risk\u201d of abnormal liver function, said Rong Xu, professor of biomedical informatics at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and co-author of the preprint study.</p> <p>And, worryingly, these issues persisted for at least six months, she said.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean the hepatitis being seen now is linked to Covid. \u201cFor this study, we just found the association\u201d of Covid and liver issues, she said. The next step would be seeing whether the children who have abnormal liver function after Covid subsequently experience other negative outcomes.</p> <p>It could be that weakened immune systems, battered by Covid or other viruses, make the children more susceptible to hepatitis. Another researcher has <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(22)00166-2/fulltext\">proposed</a> that Covid could create outsized immune reactions to other pathogens long after the initial infection.</p> <p>This study, like others, is one link in the chain, experts said, but not a smoking gun.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re always taking pieces of the puzzle and slowly building them together,\u201d Kindrachuk said. \u201cAll these things have to be put on to the list of potential causal agents, and now we\u2019ve got to try to do the difficult part, which is to say, \u2018What <em>is</em> it?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Whether the cause is traced to an adenovirus, the coronavirus, some combination of the two, or another culprit entirely, the research emerging points to possible long-term effects of viruses, especially as they spread widely and reveal rare side-effects.</p> <p>Covid, for instance, has been shown to affect hearts, brains, lungs, livers and kidneys long after the initial infection ceases \u2013 and even in mild cases.</p> <p>\u201cI really worry about the long-term effects of Covid-19 on multiple organ systems of children,\u201d Xu said.</p> <p>The good news is that we know how to prevent cases of this and many other viruses, by employing masks, improving ventilation, washing hands, providing sick leave, vaccinating everyone who is eligible, and more, Kindrachuk said.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have all the answers for what\u2019s going on right now.

And in the US\u2019s second-most-populous city, passengers at Los Angeles international airport (48 million passengers in 2021) can be charged street price plus 18%, said a spokesperson.

Plus, there have been warnings of worse to come. But what does it all mean? We asked readers what questions they had about inflation and its impact, and have tackled them below.</p> <p>First, a bit of background.</p> <p>The rise in the cost of living is captured in the monthly inflation rates reported by the Office for National Statistics. There are several different rates recorded by the economists: the consumer prices index (CPI), retail prices index (RPI), and CPIH (CPI including owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs). It is CPI that hit 9% last month. CPIH was 7.8%, while RPI hit 11.1%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0281c8ecb12602a38ca2adb7e7f9684e70dd8801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0281c8ecb12602a38ca2adb7e7f9684e70dd8801/1499_40_2070_2414/857.jpg\" alt=\"A woman browses in a supermarket\" width=\"857\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cost of food, energy, transport, entertainment and more is going up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rates are different because of the goods that are included in the price tables, and also because of the way the figures are calculated. RPI tends to be the highest. It is set to be scrapped in 2030 but is currently still used to set the student loan interest rate and annual increases in train fares.</p> <p><strong>Q Would 0% inflation be good?</strong></p> <p><strong>Hilary Osborne:</strong> inflation is the rate at which prices are going up \u2013 it does not tell you how high prices are historically, just how much higher or lower they are than last year. So if this time next year inflation is 0%, that means prices will still be higher than in the same period in 2021.</p> <p>That said, no one targets getting inflation to 0% or even below. Inflation of 2% is generally considered good \u2013 this is the rate that the Bank of England and other central banks target. This rate is high enough to encourage people not to sit on all of their cash and wait for prices to go down but low enough to allow people to plan and wages to keep up.</p> <p>Banks generally react to rising inflation by adjusting interest rates upwards \u2013 the idea is that this will encourage people to save their money rather than spend it and reduce demand for goods and services.</p> <p><strong>Q The current inflation isn\u2019t caused by an increase in demand or in wages \u2013 it\u2019s caused by a rise in supply costs. This is in part caused by the war and Covid and the resulting shortages and supply chain problems</strong><strong> but isn\u2019t the real problem that commodity-producing corporates are taking advantage of their virtually monopoly positions?</strong></p> <p><strong>Larry Elliott:</strong> this is right on the money. Traditionally, higher interest rates work when the economy is overheating and \u2013 the housing market apart \u2013 there is no evidence that it is. The UK\u2019s national output of goods and services is only just above its pre-pandemic levels, so effectively two years of growth have been lost.</p> <p>The Bank of England has admitted it can do little in the face of rising energy costs, and originally thought it would be possible to wait for inflation to come down without doing very much. It has now been spooked by evidence that inflation will stay higher for longer, and some signs that higher energy prices are feeding through into other parts of the economy. The risk of driving the UK into recession is clearly there. A windfall tax on the energy companies is going to happen, whatever the government currently says.</p> <p><strong>Q I\u2019m a first-time buyer who has saved </strong><strong>almost all of my target deposit. I want to get on to the property ladder to stop paying rent, and because my money is currently in the bank doing nothing. Is this a wise time to buy or should I hold off?</strong></p> <p><strong>LE:</strong> the housing market is starting to cool down a bit but it is far too early to say there is going to be a property crash. For that to happen, there would need to be a sharp rise in mortgage rates and unemployment rather than the more modest increases that are currently predicted. That said, the willingness of people to take on big financial commitments is understandably weak at present, which suggests that house prices are not going to do much in the next year or so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0be85d52c55927e34d7b700255c744efd398c845\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0be85d52c55927e34d7b700255c744efd398c845/252_104_5223_3581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cottages in Gloucestershire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many people want to know what\u2019s going to happen to house prices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil McAllister/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Q Why is the annual increase in state pensions based on the CPI rate in September of each year? Would an average of inflation taken over the calendar year be a more equitable rate for the increase in April?</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong> September\u2019s figure is used to give the government time to set up the change in payments. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now a partner at the consultancy LCP, says that after the September figure is published in October, the Department for Work and Pensions needs to look at its data and announce plans to parliament \u2013 usually in November\u2019s budget. The actual legislation to implement the changes doesn\u2019t get debated until the start of the following year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a7b550d4d1457de60ca33b71b85621dc4d99c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a7b550d4d1457de60ca33b71b85621dc4d99c91/223_691_3858_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Money spilling out of pension pot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"545\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The triple lock on the state pension was not used this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trevor Chriss/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of parliamentary process to go through (we are talking about billions of pounds of public spending) and time to change rates, especially for legacy benefits on old computer systems,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Each month\u2019s figure is based on a comparison with prices the year before, so is always taking account of 12 months of changes. When inflation is fairly stable, September\u2019s figure is arguably as good as any. Usually, the triple lock \u2013 the promise that pensions will rise in line with inflation, average earnings or 2.5% \u2013 irons out some of the ups and downs but this was not used this year.</p> <p>A simple average of last year\u2019s monthly CPI rates actually results in a smaller increase than the 3.1% rise this year because inflation was below 1% in the first part of 2021.</p> <p><strong>Q I work as a postman and we have only been offered a 3.5% pay rise. If we get a bigger increase, will that have an impact on inflation?</strong></p> <p><strong>LE:</strong> higher pay awards are not causing inflation. Wages are a price like any other and reflect market forces. Higher pay will mitigate some (but not all) of the hit to living standards caused by rising inflation and should encourage people currently not working to look for jobs. That should help ease labour shortages, one of the supply-side constraints affecting the economy.</p> <p><strong>Q My son is buying a house. I am worried the likely rise in mortgage interest rates as a result of inflation will affect his budget. Can anyone give us some guidance on the outlook for peak interest rates?</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong> sadly, no one can tell you where interest rates will end up, although many people will speculate. Some economists have forecast the base rate going up from 1% now to 3% next year but most are not predicting such a big rise. The <a href=\"https://www.chathamfinancial.com/technology/european-market-rates\">money markets</a> currently suggest that the base rate will peak at just above 2% in about two years\u2019 time. Mortgage rates are likely to be higher.</p> <p>If your son already has a mortgage approved, then his budget should have been closely inspected by the lender and he should be well cushioned against interest rate rises. Before banks and building societies agree to a mortgage, they stress-test applicants, typically at a rate above the standard variable rate. They also look at income and outgoings when assessing if a mortgage is affordable. He will probably also have chosen a fixed-rate mortgage to protect himself against rises in the short-term.</p> <p>If he is about to apply, rising rates will have an impact on what he is allowed to borrow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f16ddcba93999f43926169aa40a66cfa62f8e109\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f16ddcba93999f43926169aa40a66cfa62f8e109/45_330_5518_3311/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Houses for sale in Cambridge, England\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you have already had a mortgage approved, your budget should have been closely inspected by the lender.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Farrelly/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Q Is it worth saving these days?</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong> it\u2019s a good question, given that any money held in a savings account is effectively falling in value. With inflation running so high, the cash you have saved will buy you less than this time last year because there are no accounts that will have paid you enough interest to keep up.</p> <p>However, as Sarah Coles from the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown points out, there\u2019s a good reason to hold savings. \u201cThe last couple of years have shown us just how unpredictable life can be, and how much difference it can make to have something to fall back on when we\u2019re hit with the unexpected,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone of working age should be working towards a savings safety net of three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses in an easy access account \u2013 which rises to one to three years\u2019 worth when you have retired.\u201d</p> <p>This cushion means that if you are hit with an unexpected bill, you will not have to borrow to pay it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13da2ec6cc3b734766728bed84f664885d009bf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13da2ec6cc3b734766728bed84f664885d009bf7/439_29_5161_3625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piggy banks on blue background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Money held in a savings account is effectively falling in value.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: OsakaWayne Studios/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt the moment, any money in a savings account will be losing spending power after inflation but you should still make sure it works as hard as possible for you,\u201d she says. She suggests an instant access account from Al Rayan Bank paying 1.31%. For a higher rate, she says you can earn 2.27% on a one-year fix with Al Rayan Bank, or 2.75% on a two-year fix with Market Harborough building society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"01851f312a9159c3f691ea8b334c356c9634758e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01851f312a9159c3f691ea8b334c356c9634758e/758_174_4174_3122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pigeons are pictured in a general view of the Bank of England in the City of London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is a limit to what the Bank of England can do about inflation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Q Inflation is 9% for the average person</strong><strong> but how do I know what the impact is on me, as I may have a bigger mortgage than someone else, or buy different things?</strong></p> <p><strong>HO:</strong> your personal inflation rate will depend on what you spend your money on \u2013 and how much goes on each element. Everyone buys energy but some people buy more of it, and some people have to use proportionally more of their income to pay for it. There are calculators where you can work out your personal inflation rate. The ONS <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/howisinflationaffectingyourhouseholdcosts/2022-03-23\">has one on its website</a> that lets you fill in exact numbers, as does the <a href=\"https://www.rathbones.com/personal-inflation-calculator\">investment firm Rathbones</a>. These will help you see where your money is going and will be helpful for financial planning.</p> <p><strong>Q Is there another way for the Bank of England to fight inflation apart from raising the base rate?</strong></p> <p><strong>LE:</strong> there is a limit to what the Bank can do, given the tools at its disposal. In essence, it can make the cost of borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates, or it can suck money out of the economy through a process known as quantitative tightening, which involves selling the bonds it has accumulated since the financial crisis of the late 2000s. However, base rates and QT are blunt instruments. It is the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who the country should look to for action.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2022/may/23/medecins-sans-frontieres-pulls-images-of-teenage-survivor-after-outcry", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-23T06:00:09Z", "webTitle": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res pulls images of teenage rape survivor after outcry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/medecins-sans-frontieres-pulls-images-of-teenage-survivor-after-outcry", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/23/medecins-sans-frontieres-pulls-images-of-teenage-survivor-after-outcry", "fields": {"headline": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res pulls images of teenage rape survivor after outcry", "trailText": "NGO takes down photos of girl, 16, from DRC from website after critics call them unethical and racist", "body": "<p><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/medecins-sans-frontieres\">M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res</a> has removed photographs of a teenage rape survivor from its website after criticism that the images were unethical and racist.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.msf.org/\">MSF</a> took down two photos of a 16-year-old girl from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) who was gang-raped by three armed men, after photographers, activists and human rights lawyers condemned the images on Twitter.</p> <p>A spokesperson said the medical NGO accepted that it had been \u201ca misjudgment \u2026 to publish identifiable pictures of a minor who had been through this experience\u201d.</p> <p>He said the orphaned girl, who had been raped two months before the photoshoot, consented to being photographed, but that MSF had decided that was insufficient justification to publish the pictures \u201cconsidering her age and the kind of trauma she had gone through\u201d.</p> <p>The photographs, which show the girl lying on a bench after receiving treatment at an MSF hospital, were taken in Drodro, a refugee camp in Ituri province. They came under fire after Benjamin Chesterton, the director of the UK film production company <a href=\"https://www.duckrabbit.info/about/\">Duckrabbit</a>, criticised their portrayal of black African women and girls who had survived sexual assault as racist and dehumanising.</p> <p>MSF initially defended the project but after continued condemnation from Chesterton, who has previously worked for the NGO in DRC, it removed five photos, including two of the girl, from an article on its website that also mentions her first name.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/newsha-tavakolian/\">Iranian Magnum photographer</a> <a href=\"https://www.newshatavakolian.com/\">Newsha Tavakolian</a>, who took the photos, said MSF had removed the images without informing her.</p> <p>Tavakolian said MSF had selected the photos for publication: \u201cThey also refrained from publicly explaining the reasons for making this decision, nor did they highlight the fact that I was never told not to take images of minors. It simply was never discussed,\u201d she said. \u201d</p> <p>She defended the project \u2013 Ituri, a Glimmer through the Crack<strong> \u2013 </strong>which she said reflected the fact that many rape survivors in DRC were teenagers. She \u201cisn\u2019t a \u2018typical\u2019 16-year-old, living a child\u2019s life in a world of comfort. No, she lives in east Congo, in an area where rape is an instrument of war,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The MSF spokesman accepted that the NGO\u2019s guidelines for photographers and filmmakers on how to handle such cases, in which a minor who has survived sexual violence does not have parents or guardians, were inadequate.</p> <p>\u201cThat is why we are working to revise them to provide greater clarity on issues around images of identifiable minors who have suffered significant trauma,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sherizaan Minwalla, a <a href=\"https://www.seedkurdistan.org/portfolio-items/sherizaan-minwalla/\">human rights lawyer who works with Yazidi survivors of sexual enslavement by Isis</a>, contested MSF\u2019s view that the girl had been able to give informed consent.</p> <p>\u201cEven if she was dying to tell everyone that she was gang-raped so she can help other people, they need to be able to say she\u2019s a minor, the perpetrators are still at large, we\u2019re not acting in the best interests of the victim if we move forward,\u201d she said adding that MSF\u2019s guidelines needed to be strengthened to avoid exploiting minors. \u201cYou\u2019re putting her at risk of retaliation, as well as stigma and shame,\u201d she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.marthinolly.com/\">Martha Tadesse</a>, an Ethiopian photographer who also criticised the photos on Twitter, said there was a racist double-standard in the treatment of black African survivors of sexual violence. It was inconceivable that similar photos of a white European or US minor would have been published, she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just smash their childhood like that because they are a black child,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t give me this black trauma porn, making it, \u2018Oh, Congo is different\u2019.

It had been a tough eight months: tragic sibling loss, parental loss, \u200bprecarious finances, family illness. </p> <p>But something only two minutes from my door seemed to help: the River Thames. I\u2019ve always headed to the river: on it, in it, across it, cycling next to it. It\u2019s always been where I liked to wander.</p> <p>To be able to immerse myself in a place I feel so connected with was truly quite incredible.

The suspension came after legal advice found the government could not expel Ward from the parliament.</p> <p>It means that he cannot visit the parliament, or local schools, but does not restrict him from acting as an MP in all other ways.</p> <p>At the time, the NSW deputy premier, Paul Toole, said the government had sought advice on whether it could take further steps to restrict Ward from being paid as an MP. The government referred the matter to the state\u2019s parliamentary privileges committee.</p> <p>That committee has now recommended the government should not take any steps to restrict Ward of his pay and entitlements, and that it does not have the power to stop him from acting as an MP.</p> <p>While the government could enact legislation to further restrict Ward, the committee found, doing so risked the prospect of creating what it labelled a \u201cghost member\u201d, and would be vulnerable to legal challenge.</p> <p>\u201cA law that provides for a member of the Legislative Assembly to be

<p>\u201cAccordingly, it is arguable that such a law is inconsistent with the system of representative government that, according to case law, the commonwealth constitution assumes to exist in the states,\u201d the report stated.</p> <p>The committee found that MPs suspended from parliament are entitled to \u201ccontinue to represent their electorate\u201d through any means which \u201cdo not involve their actual participation in debates or proceedings in the House or Committees\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSuch mechanisms would include being able to access their electorate office resources and staff, make representations for constituents, and engage in parliamentary activities such as the lodging of questions on notice and petitions,\u201d the committee found.</p> <p>When Ward was first charged, the state\u2019s premier, Dominic Perrottet, said he would ask him to resign and, if he didn\u2019t quit, the government would \u201cmove a motion to remove him\u201d.</p> <p>Ward has repeatedly denied the charges against him and has continued to act as an MP.</p> <p>\u201cI am innocent, and I intend to prove it,\u201d he said in March.</p> <p>Ward was not present at his first court appearance last week, instead posting photos of himself meeting with constituents in his electorate.</p> <ul> <li><p><a

law expert Anne Twomey and barrister Stephen Free SC.</p> <p>Following Ward\u2019s suspension, MPs within the parliament had privately raised their concern that taking further steps against Ward could create a precedent which would lead to the politicisation of suspension motions, something the committee raised in its report.</p> <p>It found that \u201cproblematic issues\u201d would arise if \u201cany legislation that sought to exercise punitive powers against a Member were to be used in a way that might be seen to be partisan, politically motivated or unjust\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSuch a

Here are four scenarios for an end to the violence:</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Ukraine wins</strong></p> <p>A Ukrainian victory means different things to different people. To some it is pushing Russia back to the territories it controlled before the start of the invasion; for others it\u2019s about pushing it back to the pre-2014 borders, before Russia annexed Crimea.</p> <p>Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum and the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House, told me that a real victory for Ukraine is one where the country is in a more secure position than it was before the war began. This is the second Russian-Ukrainian war in the last decade, she notes, and a meaningful victory should stop a third war from ever happening. Practically speaking, in the short term, Orysia says, \u201cUkraine will have to push Russia out of as much territory as possible, including the occupation in the south and in Donbas\u201d.</p> <p>But there is a larger issue. \u201cA Ukrainian victory means that Putin\u2019s doctrine and Russian revanchism is contained [in Russia] and, eventually, put an end to completely,\u201d Orysia says. Anything else is an \u201cinterim solution\u201d (which isn\u2019t to be discounted if it could stop the immediate effects of war). But to claim any real long term resolution, she adds, the underlying problems that caused the war must be addressed and dealt with. And, perhaps most importantly, Orysia argues, the mistakes of 2015 cannot be repeated: \u201cUkraine was pushed into concessions and a ceasefire agreement that, in the end, only gave Putin an upper hand to prepare for a bigger war.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Russia wins</strong></p> <p>A Russian victory is more difficult to imagine for a number of reasons. I spoke to senior international affairs correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison, who has been covering the war on the ground, about what it might look like. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s important to differentiate between whether the whole world is saying Russia won or if Putin decides to declare victory himself \u2013 because those are potentially two quite different things,\u201d she says. Another reason why it\u2019s so difficult to envision what victory for Russia might look like is that the goalposts have moved so dramatically since the start of the war. \u201cPutin\u2019s objectives were pretty clear: to take Kyiv and install a puppet government,\u201d Emma says. \u201cBut now that seems militarily impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Another road to victory is to simply run down the clock, with Russia working under the assumption that, even if the west keeps supplying Ukraine with arms, Kyiv\u2019s army might run out of military personnel. Or, as time wears on, the war may just fall down the agenda in western countries, and resources and capital may slowly stop flowing in. This could lead to a situation where Ukraine capitulates, but this would take years. A victory in this scenario would look like mass loss of life, much of Ukraine levelled, and economic devastation for both countries.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A negotiated settlement</strong></p> <p>One way the war could end, is the way that many wars in history have ended \u2013 some kind of peace deal. Dr Sam Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King\u2019s College London, sees such a settlement as difficult to achieve. Russia\u2019s initial demands from Ukraine were unworkable, he argues: \u201cDemilitarisation is not likely to happen and \u2018de-nazification\u2019, whatever that means in the Ukrainian context, is a mythological problem, so it doesn\u2019t really have anything other than a mythological solution.\u201d These things cannot be negotiated, partly because they\u2019re non-negotiables from the Ukrainian perspective, but also because some of the problems are entirely within the heads of the Russian government, Greene says.</p> <p>The other sticking point is that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is an elected representative of the Ukrainian people \u2013 any settlement has to be mandated by them too. \u201cThey would not support a negotiated solution that would cede control of Ukrainian territory on a permanent basis,\u201d Greene adds.</p> <p>So a negotiated settlement would have to mean that Russia would move away from some of its stated aims and Ukraine would have to move to some kind of neutrality status (this means that, under international law, Ukraine won\u2019t interfere in armed conflict involving other belligerent parties \u2013 and crucially it cannot allow a belligerent party to use their country in any kind of militaristic capacity).</p> <p>The most important question in all of this, Greene says, is what the west\u2019s response will be because their priority is keeping Russia isolated at least to some degree to stop them from waging further war. \u201cThe more you keep Russia isolated the harder it is for them to reinvest in their military,\u201d he says. \u201cSo sanctions actually do become a tool of military engagement.\u201d But in the context of a settlement, the international community would need to prioritise peace, not maximum humiliation for Russia.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A ceasefire</strong></p> <p>The most likely end to the violence will not be an end to the war at all, but a ceasefire, says Greene. \u201cZelenskiy has been clear about his willingness to talk to the Russians, if the Russians are willing to talk openly and honestly about some kind of a ceasefire arrangement that will stop people from dying.\u201d It\u2019s the quickest and most effective way to curb the continued violence without anyone having to admit defeat, and a process the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/zelenskiy-signals-readiness-for-new-talks-if-mariupol-troops-are-not-harmed\">Ukrainian president restated his willingness</a> to embark upon over the weekend.</p> <p>While the relief of a ceasefire would be welcome, it could have unwelcome consequences, too. As in the years after the initial invasion of Ukraine, a prolonged stalemate could just give space and capacity for Russia to re-strategise and reinvest in its military \u2013 which could ultimately lead to an even lengthier war.</p> <h2>What else we\u2019ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>The <strong>world of the super-rich has always seemed elusive</strong> but that has only further propelled our curiosity and suspicion.

With all that clamor cleared away, other sounds filled the air. For New York City native Randall Poster, the most enchanting of them came from the hawks, cuckoos and warblers that could finally be heard above the din. \u201cAmid the quiet, I became more aware of all the birdsong around us,\u201d Poster told the Guardian. \u201cAlso, during a time when so much was unknown and dark, looking out the window and watching nature\u2019s creatures continuing to thrive was comforting.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/18/antonia-cytrynowicz-sam-gendel-live-a-little-interview\">\u2018Her playfulness is infectious\u2019: meet the 12-year-old behind 2022\u2019s most beguiling album</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was also inspiring. For Poster, one of the film world\u2019s most prominent music supervisors who has worked with directors like Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese and Todd Haynes, the hoots and caws of birds inspired him, and the project\u2019s executive producer Rebecca Reagan, to ask their wide range of musical contacts if they\u2019d be interested in creating their own odes to aviary life.</p> <p>The question struck a deep and immediate chord. More than 200 artists enthusiastically agreed to create new pieces to salute birdsong. They ranged from Elvis Costello and Beck and Jarvis Cocker to Nick Cave, the Flaming Lips, and Kamasi Washington. The result is a 242-track behemoth titled For the Birds, that, starting today, will arrive in five installments released over as many months. All proceeds will go to the Audubon Society.</p> <p>For Poster, the project has as much to do with the activist movement to protect birds as it does with an appreciation for the sounds they make. \u201cI see this project as a great way to draw attention to the crisis around bird life,\u201d he said from his office overlooking New York\u2019s Gramercy Park. \u201cBirds are under tremendous threat from the overdevelopment of the planet. It\u2019s destroying their habitats and disrupting their migratory patterns. There\u2019s also a problem with all the glass buildings that keep their lights on at night. Millions of birds get killed smashing into them.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO6XqtGcL9Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LO6XqtGcL9Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Urgent as those issues may be, much of the music for the project luxuriates in calm. Many tracks strike a meditative tone and their arrangements tend toward the spare, the better to leave room for the birdsong to alight on the music. Some of the aviary contributions come from samples, others from field recordings the players made to capture the gulls, wrens and cockatoos around them. Interestingly, few of the mixes of human sounds and birdsong feel imposed or ornamental, despite the fact that the birds had no say in the matter. To musical contributor Jonathan Meiburg, whose group Shearwater took its name from a long-winged sea bird, the connection between the species couldn\u2019t be clearer. \u201cBirds make music for the same reasons we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do it to communicate. Sometimes they do it just for the joy of it. Other times for the sensation of it. The more attuned you become to the natural world, the more you understand that it\u2019s not alien to your own experience.\u201d</p> <p>Poster goes further, declaring that \u201cwe <em>are</em> birds. Like them, we\u2019re fragile and we\u2019re threatened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re beautiful and we don\u2019t want to be alone. We go from place to place and we want to take care of our children. The connections are profound.\u201d</p> <p>The For the Birds project is far from the first musical venture to employ birdsong. According to composer Nico Muhly, who contributed a track to the project, \u201cyou can hear it as far back as pre-baroque music, where stringed instruments were used to imitate natural sounds\u201d.</p> <p>In a more literal way, the 20th-century French composer Olivier Messiaen incorporated the sound of winged creatures into many pieces he wrote. Likewise, the contemporary musician Paul Winter has used nature sounds in his music for decades. In a new song by Shearwater, Meiberg let a toucan take a solo. For Poster, role models for the project were the tweets and coos in classic rock songs like Layla, by Derek and the Dominoes and Blackbird, by the Beatles. He began reaching out to musicians for their contributions in the fall of 2020, knowing he had to act fast, before Covid restrictions loosened and the stars were able to get back on the road. The first artist he contacted was Nick Cave who, along with Warren Ellis, created a piece featuring the sounds of mourning doves. From there, artists spread the word, paving the way for a wide wake of contributors. On some tracks, artists collaborated with each other remotely. For one piece, Mark Ronson kicked things off by creating a beat. Then he invited Damon Albarn to add a chorus before bringing in Wale to layer on a rap. Some pieces have firm structures; others go for an ambient feel, such as Muhly\u2019s track May Birds. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear beginning, middle or end to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a garden of sound you sit with.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDz_Ms3lmts\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kDz_Ms3lmts?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The artists on the project cover a broad landscape of genres, from modern alternative stars like Devandra Banhart, to vintage folkies like Loudon Wainwright, to avant-gardists like Terry Riley to jazz artists like Rudresh Mahanthapp. While many of the pieces maintain a quiet and enraptured mood, those by Riley and Mahanthappa capture nature\u2019s racket. \u201cBirds don\u2019t just sing,\u201d Meiburg said. \u201cThey screech and scream, and some make sounds so deep, they\u2019ll rattle your breast bone if you stand right next to them. The sheer variety of sounds birds can make is staggering. Some can even make multiple sounds at once. Compared to them, human music is pretty primitive.\u201d</p> <p>Meiburg\u2019s track on the set, Kwitaro Backbone, includes birds from a field recording he made some time ago while standing on a sandbank overlooking a river in Guyana. \u201cTo hear bird voices \u2013 all of them present and equally loud \u2013 is a beautifully democratic experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can become a spiritual experience when you marinate in it.\u201d</p> <p>All of the set\u2019s tracks were newly recorded, though a few pre-existing pieces were remixed to feature birdsong, including those by Yoko Ono, Philip Glass and Alice Coltrane. Similarly, Elvis Costello created a fresh medley out of vintage songs, linking his rapturous 1993 piece The Birds Will Still Be Singing to the Beatles\u2019 This Bird Has Flown.</p> <p>The contributors don\u2019t all come from the world of music. There\u2019s also a visual component to the package, with architects like Nina Cooke John and artists like Andy Holden offering their innovative renderings of bird houses. Actors took part, too, by reading related poems. Sean Penn voiced Jim Harrison\u2019s Counting Birds, while Tilda Swinton delivered a wry ode titled Sparrow, written in 1968 by Norman MacCaig. In biting verse, the poem describes this dark creature as a \u201cproletarian bird\u201d with taste \u201cin clothes more dowdy than gaudy\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCOvJTUkKzk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CCOvJTUkKzk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Another witty piece came from Jarvis Cocker, whose Cuckoo Song includes the lines: \u201cI try to love you/but I guess I\u2019m out of practice/and practicing is strictly for the birds.\u201d</p> <p>One of the sparest tracks came from the Native American artist Ray Young Bear whose piece consists entirely of Indigenous chants and a stark drum to create a fleet, sonic pas de deux. Another piece translates the movement of birds into sound: the harmonies of the Haden Triplets swoop and sail, as if wafting through air. In Karen O\u2019s piece, Hum Hum Hum, she connects onomatopoetic human language to the hypnotic thrum of birds.</p> <p>Poster plans to use the project to connect, and amplify, the educational efforts of various ornithological groups, including the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the American Bird Conservancy. To help with that, the eyeglass company Warby Parker will manufacture 20,000 binoculars (or, what they call, \u201cbird-noculars\u201d), to encourage kids to get into spotting, and appreciating, these creatures. The goal is to achieve a community of concern for birds that Poster likens to a Buddhist sangha. Beyond that, Poster hopes the project will encourage everyday people to become more aware of all the flying life around us. \u201cPut a bird feeder outside your window,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be amazed by what comes your way.\u201d</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "world/2022/may/23/new-zealand-will-push-new-australia-pm-anthony-albanese-on-501-deportation-policy-jacinda-ardern-says", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-23T05:25:48Z", "webTitle": "New Zealand will push Anthony Albanese on \u2018501\u2019 deportation policy, Jacinda Ardern says", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/new-zealand-will-push-new-australia-pm-anthony-albanese-on-501-deportation-policy-jacinda-ardern-says", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/23/new-zealand-will-push-new-australia-pm-anthony-albanese-on-501-deportation-policy-jacinda-ardern-says", "fields": {"headline": "New Zealand will push Anthony Albanese on \u2018501\u2019 deportation policy, Jacinda Ardern says", "trailText": "Prime minister said it was helpful that new Australian leader had already acknowledged issues causing friction", "body": "<p>New Zealand will continue to push the conversation on Australia\u2019s \u201cproblematic\u201d deportation policy with the incoming government under Labor leader Anthony Albanese, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is obviously a really strong relationship, regardless of leader, regardless of party,\u201d Ardern said at a post-cabinet briefing on Monday. \u201cThe very nature of New Zealand and Australia\u2019s relationship is strong and enduring.\u201d</p> <p>But, her position on the \u201c501\u201d deportation policy had not changed, and Ardern was of the view it is \u201cproblematic\u201d.</p> <p>The policy of deporting residents with New Zealand citizenship on the grounds of bad character or a criminal record, even if they have lived their entire lives in Australia, caused friction between the two countries under Scott Morrison.</p> <p>In 2020, Ardern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/28/jacinda-ardern-lashes-scott-morrison-for-testing-friendship-over-deportations-to-new-zealand\">lashed out at the then prime minister</a> at their annual bilateral summit, saying the policy was \u201ctesting\u201d the friendship between the two nations, and that Australia was deporting \u201cyour people and your problems\u201d using \u201cunfair\u201d policies.</p> <p>The New Zealand government has pushed repeatedly for a reconsideration of the policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/fractious-australia-has-much-to-learn-from-the-kindness-and-purpose-of-new-zealand-politics\">Fractious Australia has much to learn from the kindness and purpose of New Zealand politics | Eleanor de Jong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat we can see already is an acknowledgment from the new prime minister of some of the things that had been causing friction in our relationship,\u201d Ardern said.</p> <p>While she would not be pre-empting any talks with Australia, she said it was helpful Albanese had recognised the policy was causing problems.</p> <p>The government accepts there are circumstances where deportation is required, adding that New Zealand also reserves that right.

She opened up about her regrets and how she should have listened when they urged her to leave an abusive ex-partner.</p> <p>It was a \u201cmonumental moment\u201d, she said. \u201cThey both broke down and hugged me. Our relationships now have moved forward and evolved and got to the point where we can move on.\u201d</p> <p>Western, 38, who has been involved with social services for 13 years, was encouraged to write the letter as part of a new approach to child services being trialled in Stockport, Greater Manchester.</p> <p>The programme, called New Beginnings, is radically different from the traditional model of child social services. Each week, parents are required to take part in intensive one-on-one counselling sessions and two-hour group therapy, as well as lessons on self-care, cooking, welfare rights and housing. There are classes for yoga, art therapy and boxing.</p> <p>Crucially, social workers are given the time to develop relationships with the families they help. Parents are helped to address and overcome the trauma experienced in their own lives, as this is often what lies behind the trouble that has led them to social services.</p> <p>Jadwiga Leigh, the chief executive of New Beginnings, said the programme aims to address the needs of the parents first, so they can then meet the needs of their child. And it appears to be working.</p> <p>Of the 60 families who have completed the programme so far, 40 had reduced or ended their involvement with social services by the end of the 24-week programme. Fifty families had stayed together; nearly half of parents had moved into employment or further education.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/933125/Stockport_Longitudinal.pdf\">review</a> published by the Department for Education in July 2020 endorsed the approach. It said New Beginnings had \u201cbrought about improved parenting skills and strategies\u201d and that parents had \u201cmade changes in safe care in their homes\u201d.</p> <p>It was hailed as an example of best practice by Josh MacAlister, the chair of the government-commissioned independent review of children\u2019s social care, whose report was published on Monday.</p> <p>It may also be cost-effective. Stockport council, which helped develop the pilot, said the scheme had saved it about \u00a3670,000 on services such as housing, drugs and alcohol treatment, and foster care, where each placement costs about \u00a351,000 a year.</p> <p>Leigh said the model could be replicated across the UK, with proper funding. \u201cI think the system is broken,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes when I was a statutory social worker I knew that I hadn\u2019t done everything I possibly could [to stop a child from being taken into care]. How can you? You make a judgment when you don\u2019t really know the family.\u201d</p> <p>She said children were being removed from families unnecessarily because of a failure to tackle issues such as past trauma or other underlying issues.</p> <p>Of the 79 families referred to New Beginnings to date, only eight parents had previously been diagnosed with additional needs. Yet Leigh\u2019s team found that 68% of the parents in fact had additional needs, including dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p> <p>The diagnosis of underlying issues is vitally important, said Leigh, because it not only affects parenting, it also affects their ability to communicate in a system that can be intimidating and bafflingly complex.</p> <p>Social workers are buckling under the strain of tackling an increased workload with fewer resources. Central government funding for children\u2019s services has fallen 24% since 2010-11, according to <a href=\"https://www.ncb.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/news-opinion/councils-forced-halve-spending-early-help\">estimates</a>, while caseloads have jumped by 23% in the past year.</p> <p>These pressures have created a culture where social workers often have to look for a quick fix, said Matthew Purves, a project coordinator at New Beginnings. \u201cMy experience of social work is that it\u2019s a revolving door,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t get to the heart of why people are struggling in the way they are.\u201d</p> <p>Western said she had felt \u201cunintentionally professionally gaslighted\u201d when raising issues with social workers in the past. But she added: \u201cThis is a system that is very underfunded. I never want to point my finger at social workers and say \u2018you\u2019re the villain\u2019, because I don\u2019t think they are.

Watching Prehistoric Planet (Apple TV+) has induced in me an existential \u2013 joy/delight? \u2013 that I don\u2019t quite know what to do with.</p> <p>To explain. Because it is new, made of money and eager to pump its schedules full of prestigious productions to attract the kind of viewers and subscription rates that keep its coffers full and reputation buffed \u2013 thus creating a virtuous, quality-programming circle for thee, me and whichever shareholders/billionaires need to be kept in space-rocket funds \u2013 Apple TV+ has recreated dinosaurs.</p> <p>I mean, not quite in the Jurassic Park sense (though I suspect it\u2019s only a matter of time) but in a manner much safer and more accessible to a wider public. Prehistoric Planet is stuffed to bursting with CGI renderings of the reptiles that roamed the Earth 66m years ago. And not just your ordinary dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus rex is there, of course, but beyond that there is the mosasaur, pterosaur, hadrosaur, tethyshadros, edmontosaurus, dromaeosaurid, antarctopelta, pachyrhinosaurus, nanuqsaurus and so many others that you may need to beg the loan of a 10-year-old dino-fan if you want to have a hope of correctly spelling the names of all the species and genuses. I couldn\u2019t find one and so have doubtless made a billion mistakes in the above list. The internet, plus the 47-year-old brain, is no match for the knowledge-sponge that is the pre-adolescent hobbyist, and I can only apologise.</p> <p>There is no uncanny valley here. The beasts \u2013 large or small, parents or juveniles, flightless or soaring \u2013 created by Moving Picture Company, the special-effects experts behind the likes of The Lion King, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Blade Runner 2049, have made them look \u2026 real. I can say no more than that. You look at the screen and you see dinosaurs. You watch episode one and find yourself thinking: \u201cHang on. I\u2019ve just seen dinosaurs. Near as dammit, they\u2019ve just filmed a wildlife documentary in the Cretaceous period and I\u2019ve watched it.\u201d They walk, run and hunt (in a pack, if you\u2019re a tenacious but tiny dromaeosaurid aiming for a massive hadrosaur instead of your customary insect intake), chirp (if you\u2019re a baby olorotitan just out of the egg your mother laid in volcanic sand to keep you warm), and sometimes simply mooch about, heedless of any extinction events one day coming their way.</p> <p>It is a heady, if slightly disorientating, experience. For British viewers, the sense of discombobulation is increased by the fact that, despite being on an aggressively new and modern channel that feels like the antithesis of the BBC, it is presented by David Attenborough. Is this allowed, you wonder? Are there not bylaws about this? Can he, too, just roam the world at will? His presence is explained by the fact that the five-part series (covering forests, sea coasts, freshwater habitats and frozen landscapes) is produced by the BBC Studios Natural History Unit, but it still takes you a moment to adjust.</p> <p>His presence assures us of the veracity of the programme\u2019s claim to have used the most up to date research available about all the dinosaurs before us. Species that have been proved to be feathered \u2013 the ancestors of modern birds \u2013 are feathered. Nest-building methods are detailed, and we\u2019re given innumerable other specifics about feeding behaviours, how young are reared, and winter-survival techniques that \u2013 presumably \u2013 have been inferred from the fossil record and currently form the best of our knowledge.</p> <p>The spectacle is wonderful, and the information valuable. But perhaps by the end there will be an appetite for something more about how that fossil record tells experts what it does. How do you look at a single skull \u2013 all that is left, as far as we are aware, of some species \u2013 and come to know anything about its owner and its ilk? Where does fact end and educated guessing begin? Does educated guessing ever blur into imagination? How do you know the colour of a dinosaur? I could take as many hours of explanation required from well-chosen workers in the myriad sub-fields of expertise to tell me all about this. The 10-year-old in me has awakened, and with it the atavistic childhood prime directive: trust, yet verify.

He was the second youngest of four children and remembers his older brother having a great reverence for Star Wars \u2013 bedsheets and toys scattered around the house, all declared off limits to younger siblings. It was his older sister, a child actor herself, who inadvertently got him into acting.

I was just excited to get to go and meet George Lucas. I think that was probably working in my favour, at the time, because I wasn\u2019t really taking it too seriously.\u201d</p> <p>In May 2000, Christensen was cast as Anakin Skywalker, allegedly beating Leonardo DiCaprio to the role and making him one of Hollywood\u2019s hottest young properties. He embraced the Star Wars fandom as much as he could, but at times it was overbearing. \u201cWe were filming a scene in Spain and somehow the local newspaper knew the location that we were going to be at and they printed it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we got to set there were thousands of people there and they had to bring in the military guard to keep them back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf464db996ea3f7888d5a96ceb248e5848c2d9f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf464db996ea3f7888d5a96ceb248e5848c2d9f0/358_16_2338_1403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christensen with Natalie Portman and George Lucas at Cannes in 2005 for the premiere of Revenge of the Sith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christensen with Natalie Portman and George Lucas at Cannes in 2005 for the premiere of Revenge of the Sith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toni Anne Barson Archive/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was especially tough on Christensen, who, unlike his co-stars Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor, hadn\u2019t experienced anything like the attention that comes with Star Wars. \u201cIt was a lot to adjust to,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually people have a more gradual ascent into that world and mine was very abrupt. But I was able to distance or detach from that experience because I knew it was about this thing that I was now a part of. I didn\u2019t really think of it as being something that was mine.\u201d Seeing his face plastered on everything from crisp packets to drinks cans took its toll. \u201cFor a period I would avoid going to the convenience store just because it was a little overwhelming. But the action figures, that was cool, I got a kick out of that.\u201d He still has a nice collection in storage.</p> <p>Being branded a teen heart-throb didn\u2019t help either. \u201cI never really connected with that identity,\u201d he says. \u201cI always wanted to be regarded as a serious actor. I guess I found that to also be a little overwhelming. But my focus has always been the work and everything else is kind of peripheral for me.\u201d</p> <p>A common perception of the prequel trilogy is that the actors were simply doing the best they could with the limited, clunky dialogue. As Harrison Ford <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/harrison-ford-gq-cover-story-2017\">infamously shouted across to George Lucas</a> while on the set of one of the films: \u201cYou can type this shit, but you sure can\u2019t say it!\u201d Christensen isn\u2019t sure that\u2019s fair. \u201cGeorge Lucas creates such a unique world where everything is so specific, from the way these characters look and the way that they talk, and I feel like sometimes people lose sight of that and they expect them to speak the same way that we speak \u2013 and that\u2019s not what we were going for.\u201d</p> <p>He still has a lot of respect for Lucas. \u201cHe was very much like a mentor to me and he was so gracious with his time. I became very close with his family, and my family became close with his family.\u201d Lucas\u2019s son, he says, is like a brother to him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ef6be5b6e58070c698568da74ef381c7ecf8b77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ef6be5b6e58070c698568da74ef381c7ecf8b77/0_144_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christensen as Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith, 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christensen as Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith, 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucasfilm/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christensen\u2019s early work after Star Wars showed promise. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1217626,00.html\">The Guardian said he brought a \u201cfrightening conviction\u201d</a> to the part of disgraced journalist Stephen Glass in the 2003 film Shattered Glass. And though his 2008 sci-fi film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/15/sciencefictionandfantasy\">Jumper</a> wasn\u2019t well reviewed, it took more than $225m at the box office. But the past decade or so has been surprisingly quiet, as Christensen drifted away from Hollywood to spend more time on his 200-acre farm north of Toronto. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved acting,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the film-making process, too. I\u2019ve just had other interests and other things that I wanted to explore as well. </p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a conscious decision,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut I found myself really enjoying my time at my farm, and it became a tough place to want to leave.\u201d It had an impact on his career, but \u201cthat was something that I was aware of and OK with\u201d.</p> <p>It has given him more time with his daughter, Briar Rose (her mother is Christensen\u2019s ex-wife, Rachel Bilson, his co-star in Jumper), as well as a chance to pursue his interests in architecture and construction vehicles by building barns and renovating old farmhouses. \u201cAll kids are sort of into their Tonka Toys,\u201d he says. \u201cI just took it to the next level and got like, you know, a full-size excavator, and a bulldozer.\u201d Despite everything, Christensen found leaving Star Wars back in 2005 difficult \u2013 he didn\u2019t want it to end. It wasn\u2019t until a few years ago that he felt comfortable attending Star Wars fan conventions. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t something that interested me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that I ever thought that I wanted to do. It just wasn\u2019t where I was at in my life. But now I love getting to connect with these fans who express how much these films mean to them, and specifically this character. And getting to see young kids dressed up as Anakin and make a connection with them. For me, it has a lot of value, and I hope it\u2019s mutual.\u201d</p> <p>Now, when Christensen looks back on his Star Wars films, he has only fond memories. \u201cI was less than a year out of high school, and I found myself on this big movie production with George Lucas and Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman and all these incredibly talented people \u2026 really, I couldn\u2019t have dreamed it up any better. I\u2019m so grateful that I got to be a part of that.\u201d</p> <p>With his return as Vader \u2013 the defining character of his career \u2013 comes the chance to reshape his legacy and, like Vader himself, to embrace redemption. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very powerful concept,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd one that really resonates within the Star Wars storytelling as well.\u201d</p> <p><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi </em><em>starts on Disney+ on 27 May</em></p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "environment/2022/may/23/fossil-fuel-funded-thinktank-charity-commission-global-warming", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-23T05:00:08Z", "webTitle": "Climate sceptic thinktank reported to charity commission over fossil fuel interest funding ", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/23/fossil-fuel-funded-thinktank-charity-commission-global-warming", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/23/fossil-fuel-funded-thinktank-charity-commission-global-warming", "fields": {"headline": "Climate sceptic thinktank reported to charity commission over fossil fuel interest funding ", "trailText": "Global Warming Policy Foundation is lobby group not charity and brings no public good, say signatories", "body": "<p>The Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate sceptic thinktank, has been reported to the Charity Commission by the Green MP Caroline Lucas and Extinction Rebellion.</p> <p>The move comes after the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/climate-sceptic-thinktank-received-funding-from-fossil-fuel-interests\">revealed that the group received funding from fossil fuel interests</a>.</p> <p>The thinktank has charitable status, but climate campaigners say the questions about its funding mean it should be stripped of this.</p> <p>In a letter to the Charity Commission, the signatories including the writers Irvine Welsh and Zadie Smith say the GWPF is \u201cnot a charity, but a fossil fuel lobby group\u201d.</p> <p>The GWPF, set up in 2009 by the former Tory chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/27/lord-lawson-climate-scientific-adviser\">Lord Lawson</a>, has enjoyed a recent revival in its influence in parliament.

No, she says briskly. It\u2019s a play that is simply very funny, nothing more, nothing less. \u201cMark was saying the other day that when he was touting this play around a couple of years ago, he took it to a few producers who read it and said, \u2018Is it just funny?\u2019 Sometimes it\u2019s OK for something to be \u2018just funny\u2019 and not to have a message.\u201d</p> <p>Having done both comedy and drama, Abbington believes the former is trickier to pull off. \u201cAn actor has to have funny bones \u2013 to be able to look at a sentence and work out where the beats are. Reece is such a brilliant comedy actor: when I watch him, I can see he knows exactly which bits to emphasise. It\u2019s a beautiful learning curve.\u201d</p> <p>Does she feel the playing field has been levelled and women\u2019s funny bones are now fully acknowledged? \u201cNo, not by a mile. But we\u2019re getting there. We\u2019ve got wonderful women coming up but I think there\u2019s still a stigma attached to women being funny.\u201d She has, in fact, found that it\u2019s a turn-off for some men. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone, \u2018Oh I can\u2019t go out with you \u2013 you\u2019re funny.

Daisy Haggard is one, Rebecca Callard is another. We are inundated with funny women, but we have to fight for it.\u201d So the choice is either to be funny or sexy? \u201cYeah, you definitely can\u2019t be both \u2013 that\u2019s unheard of. It\u2019s ridiculous because all the women I\u2019ve just mentioned are really sexy.\u201d</p> <p>Abbington grew up an only child in Hertfordshire, her mother a housewife, her father a photographer who set up print labs. She was bullied at school by \u201ca group of girls who made my life miserable\u201d, which had a lasting effect. \u201cIt informed most of my life. I realised that when I went into therapy. You never come out of childhood unscathed, but you either have to process it and get past it, or hold on to it and have a not very nice life.\u201d</p> <p>Her childhood had its passions, though, and she initially took to dancing when her mother gave her the option of riding lessons or ballet classes. \u201cShe said I couldn\u2019t do both because we couldn\u2019t afford it and that she\u2019d much rather I do ballet because it was cheaper.\u201d She didn\u2019t feel like a natural dancer but she loved it and fantasised about performing at the Royal Opera House. She auditioned for Cats at around 17: \u201cI went up for it about eight or nine times and I didn\u2019t get it \u2013 which I\u2019m quite pleased about because it would have taken me in a completely different direction.\u201d</p> <p>One day she injured herself badly while doing the splits and a drama teacher urged her to focus on acting instead. She attended a local drama school whose principal, John Gardiner, was an inspiration. She acted in one of his plays and found an agent while still a student.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d5c1d4b08b3b0b320220c5dc1616cf40650f49e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d5c1d4b08b3b0b320220c5dc1616cf40650f49e/0_154_7216_5104/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daredevil \u2026 Jonathan in The Incredible Mr Goodwin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daredevil \u2026 Jonathan in The Incredible Mr Goodwin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Neaves/UKTV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being a mother and an actor over the years has been a juggle, Abbington says, in what sounds like understatement. She gets her children on to the school bus at seven every morning before travelling to London from Hertfordshire for rehearsals, and then heads home by 7pm. How have the work-life navigations changed since her split from Freeman? It\u2019s been fine, she says. The children divide time between their homes. \u201cHe\u2019s a great dad and we get on really well. We share the childcare and make sure they\u2019re OK above everything else.\u201d</p> <p>In 2019, on Desert Island Discs, Freeman spoke of how hard it was to play Abbington\u2019s on-screen husband, Dr Watson in Sherlock, while in real life they were separating. Was it hard for her, too? \u201cYeah, it was. We\u2019d gone through the break-up months before and kept it very quiet. So doing that really was difficult.\u201d</p> <p>There is, she says, no rancour. \u201cWe had 16 years together and two amazing children. We broke up for reasons that were personal but we had a great time. Now we\u2019ve moved on. He\u2019s got a lovely girlfriend called Rachel and I\u2019m engaged to the most amazing person. This is the second half of my life, which I\u2019m going to be doing with him.\u201d</p> <p>At 50, she feels the healthiest she has ever been, in every way. Her new partner is Jonathan Goodwin who, until last October, was a professional escapologist, stunt performer and daredevil. He was in the series Dangerman: The Incredible Mr Goodwin. However, two days before we meet, Abbington announced that, after a serious accident during a stunt<strong>,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-61314239\">Goodwin had been left permanently paralysed</a>. He had been 30ft in the air, upside down and strapped into a straitjacket between two cars when he was accidentally crushed. He lost a kidney, broke his shoulder blades, severed his spinal cord and shattered both legs. He almost died in the accident, then again on the operating table.

But Jonathan is so strong. He\u2019s a proper inspiration. He\u2019s never once moaned about it. He\u2019s sometimes nostalgic about what he did but at the same time it\u2019s like, \u2018This is the next chapter of my life now.\u2019 A lot of people I know asked me, \u2018Are you staying with him?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah of course.\u2019 I can\u2019t imagine life without him.

There are Israelis too, living in contested territory and enacting the fear, hostility and oppression of that conflict which has become so dreadfully familiar to us through news feeds that even the language around its reporting is inflammatory.</p> <p>What this slowly rumbling earthquake of a show does so startlingly well is take the conflict and make it small, specific, multi-layered \u2013 yet as devastatingly epic as Greek tragedy. Sami Ibrahim\u2019s script revolves around a Palestinian family living in a village east of Jerusalem and being slowly destroyed. Reem (Hala Omran, bolshy, mercurial) is its matriarch and our central narrator; alongside her is her melancholic husband, Sayeed (Miltos Yerolemou, just wonderful).</p> <p>When an Israeli soldier, Sara (Mai Weisz), is murdered, there are calls for retribution; but Reem has her own scores to settle after her children are killed. Through her we get a sense of a community living under siege, seething with powerless anger, while Sayeed just emanates hopeless resignation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3fa7d4635d3ed24d8045a7e7aaa1edec652314c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fa7d4635d3ed24d8045a7e7aaa1edec652314c8/0_201_6025_3615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Furious satire \u2026 Philipp Mogilnitskiy as Adam.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Furious satire \u2026 Philipp Mogilnitskiy as Adam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This local focus on one family has echoes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/federico-garcia-lorca\">Lorca</a>, in its intractable grudge-bearing and cycles of violence. Reem tells us of the terror of the Red Zone, of Israeli troops taking sniper shots at unarmed Palestinians, of drone strikes on houses, of children being gunned down at point blank range \u2013 including her own 12-year-old girl and then a second daughter, Salwa (Sofia Danu).</p> <p>Directed by Omar Elerian, the production is many things at once: playful and tragic, baggy and taut, always pulling back from whimsy at the tipping point of self-indulgence. Just as we are lulled by a moment of comedy or metafictive silliness, violence comes careering around the corner.</p> <p>So many of its scenes stay seared on the mind: Reem watching a video of her son\u2019s last moments; Sara begging for her life before it is horrifyingly stamped out. The saddest scene, for me, is a quiet one with Reem and Sayeed sitting side by side, she sifting lentils, he peeling an orange. \u201cCan you imagine what it\u2019d be like, not living here? Not doing all of this? \u2026 Protests and campaigns and watching people die?\u201d he says to her, and she sounds nonplussed by such an implausible thought.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64ab4a0980be9957e60ce9046155a4c9fb62738b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64ab4a0980be9957e60ce9046155a4c9fb62738b/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mai Weisz as Sara.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mai Weisz as Sara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a play with a reach way beyond its fictive bounds, addressing everything from Palestinian martyrdom to the international community\u2019s inaction over illegal settlements, while the recent, appalling killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/cold-blooded-killing-and-funeral-chaos-leave-west-bank-in-turmoil\">Shireen Abu Aqleh</a> casts a long shadow. Yet there is no simple binary of Palestinian victimhood versus Israeli oppression here. Reem\u2019s son, Jawad (Luca Kamleh Chapman), is a murderer turned mascot. Sara is given a voice beyond her death, and a searing scene brings a battle for supremacy between her and Salwa after they have died: the conflict is clearly never-ending, even reaching into the afterlife. Meanwhile, Sara\u2019s father, Adam (Philipp Mogilnitskiy), gives us one of the play\u2019s most furious satires on the absurdities of war.</p> <p>Initially, Two Palestinians Go Dogging feels like a rambling piece of improv, beginning as a standup act and slowly turning into a family story set two decades into the future, in the midst of the \u201cfifth intifada\u201d. It seems deliberately scrappy, too: bare-boned in its staging with minimal props (some rocks, fake blood, microphones) and a set made of corrugated iron and draped sheets. All of which gives it a furtive sense of illicit street theatre that could be dismantled quickly if needed.</p> <p>It also resembles a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/complicite\">Complicite</a> production in the meta-theatrical games it plays \u2013 sometimes too drawn out and distracting \u2013 and contains a boldness that is almost reckless in its dramatic risks. Every actor is in a flak jacket, and the performances are moving across the board. As a drama, it seems to call for action even as it tells us that the conflict is so unresolvable it will still be chugging on in 2046.</p> <p>It ends with a letter from the playwright stating its own Truman Show artifice, but we walk out in discomfort, not able to ignore the fact that this fiction is someone\u2019s reality. If I have a grumble it is that the show could be tighter, but it nonetheless comes with an enormous gut-punch, and is all that theatre should strive to be.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/twopalestinians/\">Royal Court theatre, London</a>, until 1 June.</p> <p><br></p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "environment/2022/may/23/country-diary-goldfinches-one-two-three-lift-up-into-the-boughs-of-the-pear-tree", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-23T04:30:07Z", "webTitle": "Country diary: Goldfinches one, two, three, lift up into the boughs of the pear tree", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/23/country-diary-goldfinches-one-two-three-lift-up-into-the-boughs-of-the-pear-tree", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/23/country-diary-goldfinches-one-two-three-lift-up-into-the-boughs-of-the-pear-tree", "fields": {"headline": "Country diary: Goldfinches one, two, three, lift up into the boughs of the pear tree", "trailText": "<strong>Creedy Valley, Devon:</strong> Their irresistible colour and song nearly proved their ultimate downfall.

Theirs is an irresistible attraction, a sweeping rush of momentum that longs to take you with it.</p> <p>Highly sociable, a generous spirit of raucous play follows these birds through their beaming display. Could it really be said that they are full of love? It is not our privilege to know.

A far more ambitious climate policy agenda than what Labor took to the election would naturally follow.</p> <p>Climate change action is often seen as a trade-off between environment and economy. In reality, many investments that will cut emissions will pay for themselves over time. Energy bills can fall as a result of more low-cost renewable power or better energy efficiency. Decarbonising will help Australia stay competitive in global markets. Most measures that cut emissions have other benefits like cleaner air and greater energy security.</p> <p>It is about investing heavily over this decade and the next, in order to reap the benefits for a very long time to come. Chris Bowen and Jim Chalmers, as climate change minister and treasurer respectively, could carry a sustained agenda of strong climate action as an investment in the country\u2019s economic future. Penny Wong as foreign minister could reinforce it internationally. It would be a legacy for the ages.</p> <p>Such a reframing would need a real national conversation about Australia\u2019s future in a world that acts on climate change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/how-albaneses-practical-pivot-on-climate-paved-the-way-for-a-greens-surge\">How Albanese\u2019s practical pivot on climate paved the way for a Greens surge | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What are the different pathways to make net zero emissions a reality? Where are the economic and business opportunities, what does it mean for trade and tax revenue, what are the social pressure points, what will be the effects in different regions, and how will we manage all this in a way that spreads both the benefits and the costs?</p> <p>The new government, or the Climate Change Authority on its behalf, could convene an inclusive and exhaustive process towards a national long-term climate strategy. If it is a true dialogue among all major groups in society, supported by the best available information, it will unveil a wealth of opportunity and ways to bridge the gaps. And focusing on agreement on goals and broad lines will make subsequent policy implementation politically easier.</p> <p>In practical terms, what can be done or started soon?</p> <p>Australia\u2019s 2030 emissions target will be increased, sending an important signal internationally and to investors.

We need meaningful electricity market reform, and low emissions should become formally part of the objectives that the regulators work to. The federal government is needed to make the push in unison with the states.</p> <p>In transport we need a faster rollout of electric vehicle charging and smart grid integration. Road tax reform can ensure that all cars pay for road use, differentiated for carbon emissions, local air pollution and congestion. And governments need to massively invest in better public transport because ever more cars is not the answer.</p> <p>The agenda for the building sector should include meaningful national energy efficiency standards, and building codes that support the use of low carbon materials. In agriculture, R&amp;D can help the farm sector shift to lower-emission practices and products. Land use could be regulated for emissions outcomes.</p> <p>Research and planning for effective adaptation to the effects of climate change needs to be greatly boosted. And we should engage much more with our neighbours in the Pacific and south-east Asia, both to help adapt to climate impacts and to collaborate on lowering emissions. Money spent in these ways will pay dividends.</p> <p>For the coal industry we need a planned approach to regional structural adjustment. An agreed timeline for closure of the remaining coal power plants would help. Economic diversification for coalmining regions needs to be prepared long in advance of mine closures. Labor\u2019s proposed \u201creconstruction fund\u201d would help fund specific initiatives, but it would make sense to also draw on the industries themselves to fund orderly closure of power stations and mines.</p> <p>And then there is the big resource industry upside, namely our renewable energy opportunity from the global shift to net zero emissions. Australia could produce and export huge amounts of clean energy as hydrogen, ammonia or electrons, and perhaps more importantly \u201cgreen\u201d energy intensive products like fertiliser, aluminium and steel. To be in the running for these new global markets, we need to ramp up applied research, make sure that Indigenous communities agree and benefit, get regulation and taxation frameworks in place, and tell the world that we are ready and willing to play on zero-carbon.</p> <p>The new government has the chance to lead with gusto, and the time to do so is now.</p> <p>\u2022 Frank Jotzo is professor of environmental economics and climate change economics at ANU Crawford School of Public Policy at ANU</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}, {"id": "books/2022/may/23/controversies-epiphanies-and-the-case-against-canva-highlights-from-sydney-writers-festival", "type": "article", "sectionId": "books", "sectionName": "Books", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-23T03:46:51Z", "webTitle": "Controversies, epiphanies and the case against Canva: highlights from Sydney writers\u2019 festival", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/23/controversies-epiphanies-and-the-case-against-canva-highlights-from-sydney-writers-festival", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/may/23/controversies-epiphanies-and-the-case-against-canva-highlights-from-sydney-writers-festival", "fields": {"headline": "Controversies, epiphanies and the case against Canva: highlights from Sydney writers\u2019 festival", "trailText": "Coinciding with the federal election, this year\u2019s festival buzzed with big ideas about politics, hope and writing.

But before the event opened, its writers were targeted by a campaign calling on them to boycott over the government\u2019s human rights record.</p> <p>For festivalgoers, the story felt eerily familiar: in January there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/23/calling-the-sydney-festival-boycott-censorship-is-a-disingenuous-attempt-by-those-in-power-to-silence-palestinians\">calls to boycott Sydney festival</a> over a funding deal the organisation struck with the Israeli embassy.

I\u2019ll tell you honestly that even now I\u2019m not sure that I made the right decision,\u201d he said. Galgut was the only writer to withdraw, the festival went ahead, and the regime continued to prevail. \u201cAnd of course I did lose my friendship with the person concerned. He has not spoken to me since, and I have to say I don\u2019t blame him for that.\u201d</p> <p>But while he didn\u2019t gain anything by boycotting, Galgut said: \u201cWhat I achieved was not to lose something even more vital \u2026 If you turn your head away from other people\u2019s suffering you lose something very essential to yourself \u2013 something that\u2019s perhaps difficult to give a name to.

Its policies are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/04/labors-climate-plan-cant-fix-12-years-of-broken-politics-but-its-a-floor-to-whats-possible\">deliberately modest</a>, designed to limit the political risk of a scare campaign while accelerating the rollout of renewable energy, cutting taxes to lower the cost of electric vehicles and gradually start to cut emissions from major industries.</p> <p>Legislation will be needed to cut EV taxes and possibly to create a $20bn Rewiring the Nation Corporation, which Labor says will bring forward construction of major electricity transmission links to new renewable energy hubs.</p> <p>Other elements of its plan won\u2019t necessarily need to pass parliament. They include using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/calling-the-safeguard-mechanism-a-sneaky-carbon-tax-is-a-scare-campaign-and-an-argument-for-inaction\">the Coalition\u2019s \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d</a> policy to start to lower industrial emissions, reviewing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/australias-carbon-credit-scheme-largely-a-sham-says-whistleblower-who-tried-to-rein-it-in\">carbon offsets system</a> and bidding to co-host a UN climate conference with Pacific countries in 2024.</p> <p>The incoming climate change minister, Chris Bowen, says the ALP wants to legislate its net zero target for 2050, which has wide support. It would also like to legislate its 43% emissions target for 2030, but doesn\u2019t have to. Bowen says it won\u2019t negotiate with crossbenchers demanding it be increased to between 50% and 75%.</p> <p>The numbers suggests it won\u2019t have to in the lower house. If Labor squeaks a majority, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/labor-increasingly-likely-to-form-majority-government-as-liberals-descend-into-turmoil\">as looks likely</a>, the influx of crossbenchers wanting greater action may have little opportunity to directly shape Labor\u2019s legislative climate agenda, although independent MP Zali Steggall will continue to argue for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/30/zali-steggalls-climate-bill-gets-broad-backing-from-industry-groups-and-investors\">her climate bill</a>.</p> <p>The exception is the Greens. The ALP will need their support in the Senate to pass any legislation not supported by the Coalition. Adam Bandt says he will take a collaborative approach but there are many unknown\u2019s, including whether the minor party will ask for greater climate action in return for it supporting non-climate related Labor legislation.</p> <p>The rise of the climate crossbench will be felt most beyond votes on the floor of parliament. As the new treasurer, Jim Chalmers, acknowledged on Saturday night, the number of voters demanding greater action can\u2019t be ignored. Some Coalition MPs have been slow to pick up on it, and argued for a shift in the opposite direction. Good luck with that. The centre of political debate about climate may finally be about to move away from unrelenting and often misleading focus on the costs of action to talking about how much more Australia should be doing.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth remembering the 43% target is a floor, not a ceiling, and Albanese will be expected to set a 2035 target before the next election.</p> <p>The crossbench is supported in its call for a stronger, legislated target by institutional investors, some business leaders and communities across the country. People may be surprised how rapidly some of them move now there is a federal government that backs action and is less likely to give them a whack if, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/on-coal-plant-closures-the-energy-industry-has-learned-to-keep-angus-taylor-out-of-the-loop\">to pick one example</a>, they want to shut a failing coal plant earlier than planned.</p> <p>There are consequential things Labor could do on climate beyond their headline commitments. They include restoring the public service including the advisory role of the Climate Change Authority, embedding climate as a priority in all government decision-making and putting much greater effort into building capacity to forecast and cope with the inevitable rise in extreme event risk.</p> <p>For the Greens, a big issue will be fighting for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/greens-to-push-for-coal-export-levy-if-they-hold-balance-of-power\">ban on new fossil fuel developments </a>and a rapid phase-out of thermal coal while helping affected communities. It shapes up as a key debate in the next term. Bill Hare, from Climate Analytics, estimates if all the proposed coal and gas projects listed on a government pipeline go ahead it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/21/more-than-1bn-of-coalitions-climate-funding-could-go-to-fossil-fuel-projects-analysis-finds\">add more than 8% to Australia\u2019s emissions by 2030</a>, and far more to global emissions after the fossil fuels are sold and burned overseas.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s position is there will be a shift away from fossil fuels as the world acts, but if companies want to invest they should be able to as long as they are meeting environmental standards. It raises a bunch of questions, including why it rejects the International Energy Agency\u2019s view there would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist\">no more oil and gas fields</a> opened if the world is serious about limiting heating to 1.5C, and what it will do to strengthen the country\u2019s environment laws, which virtually everyone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jan/28/australia-urged-to-overhaul-environment-laws-and-reverse-decline-of-our-iconic-places\">agrees are failing</a>.</p> <p>Right now, there is no one to ask about that last point \u2013 the ALP\u2019s environment spokesperson in opposition, Terri Butler, lost her seat in the Brisbane \u201cGreenslide\u201d a day after promising an Albanese government would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/labor-to-set-up-independent-environmental-protection-agency-and-restore-trust-and-confidence\">set up an independent national Environment Protection Agency</a>.

Should the 27-year-old Chilean, the world number 100 making only his 28th start on the PGA Tour, lift the Wanamaker Trophy in a few hours, it\u2019ll be a shock right up there with the leftfield victories of John Daly (1991), Rich Beem (2002) and Shaun Micheel (2003).</p> <p><strong>Should it be such a big surprise, though?</strong> Pereira fell one place short of medalling at the Olympics last year. On Tour, he finished third at the Fortinet Championship last September, tied 13th at the Texas Open in April, and tied for 17th at the Byron Nelson last week. He\u2019s also fourth this season in hitting the greens in regulation. I mean, the answer to the question is obviously YES \u2013 please identify the legions tipping Pereira for glory three days ago \u2013 but it\u2019s not as though the guy doesn\u2019t have the chops to become a major champion. Yesterday\u2019s staunch regrouping after his mini-collapse around the turn proves that.</p> <p><strong>However other shocks are available! </strong>Pereira hasn\u2019t won on Tour yet, but then neither have Matt Fitzpatrick, Will Zalatoris or Cameron Young. Abraham Ancer and S\u00e9amus Power each have one victory to their name, but nobody was bigging them up before the week began. Few were talking about veterans Stewart Cink or Bubba Watson, either, and while Justin Thomas was one of the pre-tournament favourites, if he wins from here, he\u2019d equal John Mahaffey\u2019s all-time record of winning from seven shots back after 54 holes (1978), and that would be seismic in itself.</p> <p><strong>This is all a very long-winded way of saying that whatever happens at Southern Hills today is guaranteed to be memorable.</strong> And hey, it\u2019ll be even more special if we all go on the journey together. So buckle up, friends and honorary Okies, as we set off on another wild ride into the major-championship unknown.

Well over a decade after matching the junior deeds of 13-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal, Jason Kubler finally broke through for his first ever win at Roland Garros.</p> <p>After making it through qualifying in his fourth visit to Paris as a senior, Kubler was able to hold his nerve at critical times when defeating American Denis Kudla 7-6 (5), 7-6 (2), 7-6 (3). He closed out the triumph with the shot that once seemed destined to carry him a long way in tennis when crunching a brilliant backhand down the line for a winner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/22/french-open-live-ons-jabeur-dominic-thiem-first-round\">Dominic Thiem and Ons Jabeur slip to first-round defeats in French Open</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a good thing he did, for the post-Ash Barty era in grand slams would have started on a very bleak note otherwise given the other four Australians in action on day one exited early. Afterwards, the fans who stuck around after dark on Court 13 clamoured for selfies with the 29-year-old, adults and kids among them. Kubler was happy to oblige every one of them.</p> <p>\u201cIt is still weird thinking someone wants your autograph. It is just me. It is not like I am anyone super famous,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I saved the day [for Australia] but I am personally happy that I won through. It is only the second time that I have won a main draw match, so in itself it is pretty exciting.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to the Special Ks of Australian tennis, Kubler has been very much the third billing behind Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis throughout a testing senior career. He is older than the Australian Open doubles champions, who have also endured more than their fair share of injury and motivation issues, but he too was once considered a likely star. </p> <p>The Brisbane resident was the world\u2019s top-ranked junior at the age of 16. He swept the junior Davis Cup, something only the legendary Nadal had managed previously. A baseliner by trade, he was blessed with a beautiful double-handed backhand and his serve and forehand packed a punch as well. But then chronic knee pain cruelled his rise.</p> <p>His grand slam timeline tells the story. As a 17-year-old, he debuted in the Australian Open. Eight years passed until his next appearance in a major, again in Melbourne, in 2018. There have been 49 grand slam tournaments played since his major debut and he has only been fit enough to compete in 15 of them. Six have resulted in main draw appearances. </p> <p>Even making it through qualifying was a bonus. \u201cEven looking back at quallies, some of the matches I should not have even won,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Comebacks can be hard at the best of times, as US Open champion and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/22/french-open-live-ons-jabeur-dominic-thiem-first-round\">dual-French Open finalist Dominic Thiem</a> is finding after posting his seventh straight loss since returning earlier in the day. </p> <p>Kubler could not say afterwards how many times he has attempted to return to the court. As other Australians chased glory on the hard courts in North America, Kubler was plying his trade in lowly clay courts through South America in what was a lonely experience at times. </p> <p>The shifting surface offered some solace for his aching knee joints. But it meant his career was largely restricted to the secondary tours where matches are played for a pittance. At one stage he had just 12 cents left in his bank account and was back coaching kids in Brisbane for some pocket money. He entered a local hard court event, in desperation more than anything, and left pleasantly surprised. </p> <p>The shock was not that he won the tournament but more that his knee withstood the rigours of playing on what is effectively trumped-up concrete. In 2018 he was able to play three majors and managed a win at the US Open. In a good position in his second round against Taylor Fritz, now the top-ranked American, he wrecked an ankle. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/22/norrie-backs-top-players-to-skip-wimbledon-after-atp-decision\">Norrie expects top players to skip Wimbledon after ATP decision</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Walk under a ladder? Cross a black cat? You name it, because Kubler must surely have done it, such has his injury luck been. </p> <p>Since resuming after the pandemic, he has played primarily on the Challenger Tour. Only a year ago he was knocking the ball around in a cash tournament on the Gold Coast. Earlier this year, in order to get some confidence, the right-hander dipped back to ITF Tournaments, which offer $25,000 in prize money. </p> <p>He won about $8,000 for claiming two titles in Canberra. On Sunday he pocketed $92,000. Little wonder he was happy to sign an autograph or two. He now awaits the winner of a clash between 10th seed Cameron Norrie and French wildcard Manuel Guinard. </p> <p>In his first Roland Garros appearance since 2017, Kokkinakis fell to Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5).

Instead, graves can be cleared without warning. \u201cIf you go at the right time, you will see piles of sacks of bones placed, collected, gathered, and later on buried in a common gravesite,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For families, it means losing their loved ones a second time.</p> <p>Celiz said she learned last year that she had a brain tumour, and wanted to be sure that her sons would be laid to rest with dignity. Paying additional money to the cemetery wasn\u2019t an option. Costs related to their deaths in 2017 \u2013 including their grave apartments, burials, wakes and an autopsy for Almon \u2013 had already totalled 77,000 peso (US$1,500).</p> <p>Though Celiz runs a <em>sari-sari shop</em> (a mini, neigbourhood convenience store) and sells clothes, she is also supporting her two sons\u2019 children, who are all at school.

The 2017 champion collected another shot at the 12th. As those ahead slipped and stumbled, Thomas was the man to watch. He had head in hands after missing a decent opportunity at the 15th, which he assumed was a significant moment. Still, he refused to give him. A birdie three at the penultimate hole edged him to within one of Pereira. At the last, Thomas missed from 10ft to tie Pereira but salvation was not far away.</p> <p>Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s stunning back nine of 31, including four birdies in a row from the 14th, meant a top-10 finish. This marks Fleetwood\u2019s finest major finish since the 2019 Open. Fleetwood has encountered his fair share of on-course struggles since Shane Lowry prevailed at Royal Portrush.</p> <p>\u201cThe Masters this year was my best finish that I\u2019ve ever had in a Masters; this is the best finish I\u2019ve ever had at the PGA,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cIf I can keep that train going, the other two should be decent major weeks.</p> <p>\u201cPart of life is you have your good times and your bad times.

I think everybody that gets to a certain level, with the right information, is by far good enough to come out the other side.\u201d</p> <p>Rory McIlroy began day four sitting nine shots from the lead and with no apparent chance of winning his fifth major. Hopes were raised of a famous McIlroy victory as he produced birdies at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th. The run was halted by a bogey at the 6th and run of 10 pars before another dropped shot at the 17th.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/21/tiger-woods-us-pga-golf\">Tiger Woods pulls out of US PGA to leave comeback plans in doubt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That McIlroy did not stop for media duties suggested he was seriously stung by the playing out of this tournament after an opening 65.

So it is frustrating that Satinder Kaur Chohan\u2019s script does not effectively tease out the themes it sets up. Part of the problem is the confused tone of the play.

When I went to the birthing centre, one midwife told me I was in early labour and said \u2018from looking\u2019 at me that I was having short contractions.</p> <p>\u201cI explained I was a GP who had worked in obstetrics and gynaecology and that I recognised active labour, but it didn\u2019t make any difference and I was sent home.

But the haemorrhaging got worse and she lost nearly two litres of blood.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI was in agonising pain and passing massive blood clots. It was only when I turned up at hospital and they saw the blood that they finally listened to me. I was frightened but I was almost relieved I was bleeding so much as I thought at least they will listen.\u201d</p> <p>On examination Dina was 10cm dilated, meaning she was ready to give birth. She was rushed to theatre and her baby was delivered via a ventouse suction cup.</p> <p>The next day a consultant came to check on her in the postnatal ward. \u201cShe said to me: \u2018I read what happened and in 20 years I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u2019\u201d Dina said. \u201cThis woman\u2019s tone made me feel like I was an idiot and that somehow what happened was my fault.\u201d</p> <p>She sought the advice of another obstetrician consultant, who gave a different view \u2013 they said it was not unusual she had developed a blood clot after being left for hours in labour and not monitored.</p> <p>\u201cI should have been in hospital but they denied me care,\u201d Dina said. \u201cIt made me wonder why I\u2019d been ignored and spoken down to and it felt ethnicity related.

History will lend this game a ring of inevitability. The record books will simply log it as another City title: their fourth in five years, Pep Guardiola\u2019s 10th, another silhouette to add to the mural. We will spend the days ahead chewing over where it was won and lost, what City did right and Liverpool did wrong, what it means for the legacy.</p> \n<p>But none of this will really capture the utter despondency that gripped this stadium: the incoherence, the frustration, the rage and anguish of a team and their people staring into the abyss.</p> \n<p>Sometimes it can be hard to glimpse the human face behind this sprawling super-club, with its empire of satellites, its bottomless pockets, its frictionless passing triangles, the sense of something pristine and merciless that you will never quite be able to touch. City is money, it\u2019s a political project, it\u2019s art, it\u2019s vanity, it\u2019s power. But like any club it\u2019s also its people, people who suffer and fear like any other. And for 76 minutes City showed us something we have so rarely seen in the Guardiola era: genuine vulnerability, genuine hurt, a superhuman team playing on human emotions.</p> \n<p>That skittishness was there right from the start. It was there from the first press by Gabriel Jesus, charging down the goalkeeper and forcing him to punt the ball straight out of play. From the uncertain early touches of Aymeric Laporte. From Aston Villa\u2019s nihilistic time\u2011wasting. From Guardiola bawling at a ball boy. From the muted cheer that greeted the news that Wolves had scored at Anfield. Nobody was getting excited because nobody was remotely enjoying themselves.</p> \n<p>With a pounding inevitability, Liverpool equalised. Shortly before half-time the right-back Matty Cash headed in a cross from the left-back Lucas Digne. Various members of City staff angrily pointed at things. The moment the ball hit the net, several hundred City fans immediately stood up and disappeared down to the concourse for a pint, a pie, a cry and a rethink of their life choices.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1c176e247c1b98b6f74c0f24a03950d3a4f99c5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1c176e247c1b98b6f74c0f24a03950d3a4f99c5/0_235_4125_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philippe Coutinho scored Aston Villa\u2019s second \u2013 \u2018a bucket of freezing water\u2019 that woke City up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philippe Coutinho scored Aston Villa\u2019s second \u2013 \u2018a bucket of freezing water\u2019 that woke City up.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In a way, City needed Villa to score again. Philippe Coutinho\u2019s goal was a slap in the face, a bucket of freezing water, the cold hard truth that cuts you to the core. Going 2-0 down seemed to crystallise City\u2019s mission. Meek, translucent through-balls and inky\u2011dinky crosses were no longer going to cut it. Patience and composure were no longer going to cut it. The Guardiola mood book \u2013 mostly pastels, the odd flash of teal \u2013 would be flung out of the window. Nothing less than the holy fire of purgation would do from here.</p> \n<p>And it was City\u2019s fortune that Villa were just beginning to tire a little.</p> \n<p>The heroic lunges that had previously formed an impregnable barrier to goal were now finding only fresh air. City\u2019s midfield, bolstered by the clever Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, was beginning to motor. First Raheem Sterling crossed for G\u00fcndogan to head in. Next it was Oleksandr Zinchenko with the presence of mind to cut the ball back, Rodri with the precision to find the bottom corner. Three minutes later, with the Etihad Stadium on the very brink of rapture, Kevin De Bruyne located his rampaging beast mode, rode two tackles, and slid the ball over for G\u00fcndogan\u2019s finish.</p> \n<p>The noise was like nothing else. It is impossible to transcribe. Really it was about five noises at once: the guttural roar of triumph, the squeal of consummation, the exhalation of bottled anguish, a stadium united in relief.</p> \n<p>You can\u2019t buy moments like that. You can\u2019t buy three goals in five minutes to win the Premier League title. You can buy the players who might do it, the coach who might make it happen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/trust-stability-breakfast-chats-pep-guardiola-premier-league-title-manchester-city\">Trust, stability and breakfast chats: how Guardiola delivered another title | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But the moment itself: that comes from sheer collective will, the furious mobbed energy of a public who had seen Dickov at Wembley and Ag\u00fcero against QPR and Kompany against Leicester, who know how City used to do things the hard way, who never dreamed they would have to do so again.</p> \n<p>Watch Guardiola as the third goal goes in. G\u00fcndogan sprints for the far corner, pursued by his teammates, the cameras, most of the City bench and the sound of 50,000 people. But Guardiola turns the other way: away from the pitch, away from the bench, staring up into the stands, towards his family, his people. Five years ago to the day, Guardiola was sitting at home when he received news that an attack had taken place at the Manchester Arena, where his wife and daughters were watching an Ariana Grande concert.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In that moment he was no longer the world\u2019s greatest manager, no longer the representative of a club or an ideology. He was a father, possessed by the sort of mortal terror you would not wish on your worst enemy. Guardiola\u2019s family came home that night. Twenty\u2011two people, including young children, did not.</p> \n<p>Guardiola\u2019s first words in his post-match press conference were to pay tribute to the victims. And it felt strangely fitting that at its moment of triumph, Manchester City became its people again. They flooded the pitch and took selfies and cantered across the grass and waved their flags. They sang songs about Steven Gerrard. Eventually the crowd dispersed and two of the groundstaff were finally able to remove the broken goal from its moorings and carry it off the pitch, where it made the shape of a perfect W.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "environment/2022/may/22/police-warn-against-vigilante-action-against-duckling-hit-and-run-driver", "type": "article", "sectionId": "environment", "sectionName": "Environment", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T20:40:41Z", "webTitle": "Police warn against vigilante action against duckling hit-and-run driver", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/22/police-warn-against-vigilante-action-against-duckling-hit-and-run-driver", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/22/police-warn-against-vigilante-action-against-duckling-hit-and-run-driver", "fields": {"headline": "Police warn against vigilante action against duckling hit-and-run driver", "trailText": "Driver\u2019s details shared on social media after allegedly running over ducklings near Stoke-on-Trent as other drivers waited for them to cross", "body": "<p>Police have urged the public against any vigilante actions after the registration of a driver who allegedly ran over a brood of ducklings was published online.</p> <p>Staffordshire police confirmed it is investigating a Facebook post which claimed that at least three ducklings were killed on Friday at a roundabout in Trentham near Stoke-on-Trent.

In his later, country incarnation in the 70s with more measured style and subdued hair, Jerry Lee is shown performing Whole Lotta Shakin\u2019 again, and it sounds even more predatory. No one made the line \u201cwe got chicken in the barn\u201d sound more horribly unwholesome. He would still periodically go into the weird marionette playing style, bending his forearms up at the elbow, alternating to bring his fists down.</p> <p>Like Elvis and all white rock\u2019n\u2019roll legends, Jerry Lee had an unpayable debt to black music and great black performers like Little Richard; Coen doesn\u2019t mention it, but there\u2019s also an obvious link between Jerry Lee and Liberace, the same weirdly coy up-through-the-lashes glance at the audience that\u2019s created when you look at them from the keyboard. Elvis\u2019s instruments were the mic stand and the guitar, which lend themselves more directly to pelvis-gyrating sexiness. With the piano it\u2019s different - you have to launch yourself crazily away from it, as if moved by the spirit.</p> <p>Jerry Lee always looked like a carnival barker and a televangelist - much more so than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/08/archive-tv-preacher-falls-from-grace\">his cousin Jimmy Swaggart</a>, who actually was a televangelist.

But the virus can cause more serious illness in those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and young children.</p> <p>Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UKHSA, said further cases identified over the weekend would be confirmed on Monday. Since the first was announced in the UK on 7 May \u2013 a person who arrived in London from Nigeria \u2013 the agency has confirmed 19 more cases, the majority among young men who have sex with men.</p> <p>The outbreak is unusual because although the UK has had sporadic cases of monkeypox before \u2013 seven from 2018 to 2021 \u2013 all previous cases were linked to travel from Nigeria. Most of the latest cases in the UK and beyond have no known links to parts of west or central Africa where the virus is endemic.</p> <p>Globally, more than 180 confirmed or suspected cases are being investigated in at least 14 countries. More than half are in Spain and Portugal. Genetic analysis of three monkeypox viruses from the outbreak have found it closely matches the virus that spread from Nigeria in 2018 and 2019. The same studies suggest that a Belgian man contracted the virus on a recent trip to Portugal.</p> <p>The pattern of the outbreak suggests the virus is spreading primarily through sexual networks. The infection can be passed on through close contact with body fluids, infected ulcers, and contaminated material such as towels and bedding. Superspreader events may have boosted the outbreak since it arrived in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible that some of these outbreaks will be driven by superspreading events,\u201d said Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University. \u201cFor example, the Spanish health authorities are looking at a sauna as a site of single exposure that resulted in many secondary cases. The reportedly mild presentations of several cases may also be a factor, in that people will be more mobile and potentially likely to socialise. However, we do still need to understand more about the transmission dynamics.\u201d</p> <p>Hopkins told BBC One\u2019s Sunday Morning show that community transmission in the UK was \u201clargely centred in urban areas and we are predominantly seeing it in individuals who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men\u201d.

It\u2019s a fantasy, obviously, which is why her mum soon butts in to tell her off for \u201crunning around with all these men, showing [your] bare legs to 70,000 people\u201d. As openings go, it\u2019s supremely silly and very British, perfectly setting the tone for what follows: a relentlessly cheerful comedy about a British Indian girl torn between her love of football and her traditional Punjabi family. And how often do we get one of those? Erm, once. Twenty years ago.</p> <p>In the intervening decades, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/15/gurinder-chadha-ive-written-a-whole-new-movie-in-lockdown\">Gurinder Chadha</a>\u2019s surprise hit starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley \u2013 who, obviously, was the one who went on to become a global superstar \u2013 has matured into the highest grossing football film of all time. Which is amazing, even if you think Bend It Like Beckham is a bit glib, cliched, overreliant on stereotypes and dodgy when it comes to sexuality, which for 20 years I did. Until I rewatched it this week and was destroyed by its glinting moments of authenticity. The scene where all the Indian <em>ammas</em> and aunties pull out their mobile phones! The dancing at the wedding! But more of that later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The film tackles race, class, gender and sexuality with a fleet-footedness that belies both the subject matter and times</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bend It Like Beckham: 20 Years On (BBC Three), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/23/racism-anti-racist-voiced-britain-stormzy-gary-neville\">Miriam Walker-Khan</a>\u2019s lighthearted documentary examining the film\u2019s impact, also opens with \u2026 Gary Lineker. Rewatching his cameo, he reckons he might have \u201coveracted a bit\u201d. He had no idea (nor did I) that Chadha was originally inspired not by Beckham but by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/31/south-london-crucible-for-black-british-footballers\">Ian Wright</a>. Apparently she saw him in a union jack flag and caught a glimpse of an evolving concept of Britishness in football. Which, 20 years on, has not evolved enough. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising that things haven\u2019t changed too much in terms of the Asian presence in the game,\u201d Lineker muses.</p> <p>Next it\u2019s off to the National Football Museum in Manchester to talk to some young sportswomen. Coach Ali Speechly, who was 19 when she first saw the film, remembers thinking: \u201cOh my God, this is me.\u201d For freestyle footballer Kaljit Atwal, \u201cit\u2019s sad that it\u2019s still relatable 20 years later\u201d. Walker-Khan meets real-life Jesminder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2018/dec/13/mollie-and-rosie-kmita-the-twins-breaking-the-mould-for-women-in-football-video\">Rosie Kmita</a>: the first south Asian woman to play in the Women\u2019s Super League (WSL). Like Jess, she grew up playing football in the park, using jumpers as goalposts and facing the difficulties \u201cthat come with being Asian and playing the game\u201d. Jess may have been a great role model, Kmita and Walker-Khan agree, but she wasn\u2019t real.</p> <p>Walker-Khan, an up-and-coming BBC Sport journalist, is a bright and engaging presenter with lots to say on Bend It Like Beckham\u2019s intersectionality: how it tackles race, class, gender and sexuality with a fleet-footedness that belies both the subject matter and times. It\u2019s a shame she doesn\u2019t interview Chadha: there\u2019s only one clip of the director, and it\u2019s from 2007. In its time, Bend It Like Beckham was criticised for being too upbeat and sidestepping the issues, but the Canadian sports journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/shireen-ahmed\">Shireen Ahmed</a> points out that its multicultural positivity was sorely needed less than a year after 9/11. \u201cThis film,\u201d she says, \u201cgave us a moment to stop apologising.\u201d</p> <p>Essentially, though, this is a documentary about football. It\u2019s about how much the landscape has changed, with the WSL now regarded as the best women\u2019s league in the world. And it\u2019s about how little it has changed, with south Asians remaining vastly underrepresented in women\u2019s football. Ahmed points out that, 20 years later, the local team on which the film\u2019s Hounslow Harriers is based is still made up of \u201ca lot of white girls\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/a-cultural-moment-what-bend-it-like-beckham-meant-for-uk-womens-football\"> \u2018A cultural moment\u2019: what Bend It Like Beckham meant for UK women\u2019s football</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve been on my own vexed journey with Bend It Like Beckham. I was 23 when it came out: at a defiant, confused stage when a film like this seemed to have nothing to say to a British Asian like me. An Indian who did not grow up in an Asian community. Whose south Indian parents weren\u2019t strict like the caricatures we (so rarely) saw on the telly. Whose football-mad, sari-wearing Hindu mum would take weeks off work every time the World Cup was on. Bend It Like Beckham was yet another thing that made me feel like a bad Indian. </p> <p>Twenty years on, I see my response was forged both by the times and what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/14/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-america-under-trump-felt-like-a-personal-loss\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a> called \u201cthe danger of a single story\u201d; a shame born out of only getting to see one version of myself. I know, now, that there are as many ways to be British Asian as there are Asians in Britain. Which is why, 20 years later, and nearly two years after my wonderful and unusual mum\u2019s death, watching Bend It Like Beckham made me cry. It was for me after all.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "football/live/2022/may/22/premier-league-final-day-clockwatch-arsenal-tottenham-burnley-leeds-live", "type": "liveblog", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T19:18:34Z", "webTitle": "Premier League clockwatch: Leeds survive as Burnley relegated \u2013 as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/may/22/premier-league-final-day-clockwatch-arsenal-tottenham-burnley-leeds-live", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2022/may/22/premier-league-final-day-clockwatch-arsenal-tottenham-burnley-leeds-live", "fields": {"headline": "Premier League clockwatch: Leeds survive as Burnley relegated \u2013 as it happened", "trailText": "Tottenham romped to a 5-0 win at Norwich to secure Champions League football next year while Leeds stayed up at Burnley\u2019s expense", "body": "<div id=\"block-628a8ac38f08d18babe121f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-22T19:11:53.463Z\">8.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There\u2019s a slight technical problem here, </strong><strong>so for the next plug I\u2019m going to have to go back to dial-up. </strong>Here\u2019s Barney Ronay at Carrow Road, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/22/carrow-road-stroll-highlights-contes-transformation-of-tottenham\">contemplating the Contefication of Spurs</a>.

The final day of the Premier League season is traditionally a time of late twists, fond farewells, squeaky bums and silly results (Sir Alex Ferguson managed to combine the lot by finishing his career with a 5-5 draw at West Brom). Today we may see a little less of the wackiness and a little more grit, because the fixture list has done us proud. There are four two-horse races still to be run, and none of the clubs involved are facing each other \u2013 so eight of the ten games starting at 4pm have something riding on them.<br></p> <p>Those races in full:</p> <p><strong>The league title. </strong>It practically belongs to Pep Guardiola, and it\u2019s his to lose. If City beat Villa, they retain the Premier League trophy. But Liverpool, who face Wolves, are only one point behind them \u2013 and they\u2019ve come from 11 points behind on 19 January. Both teams are at home today, which is more reassuring for Jurgen Klopp than for Pep. </p> <p><strong>The last Champions League spot.</strong> Leonard Cohen saw it coming: it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth. Spurs visit poor benighted Norwich, needing only a point, so they can almost afford to be Spursy. Or even to order the lasagne. Arsenal, who have slipped back into their red-card habit, can\u2019t afford to be Arsey. They entertain Everton, who are poor travellers and have nothing to play for after saving their skins in that midweek melodrama \u2013 but they have bizarrely become Mikel Arteta\u2019s bogey team, with victories in the last three league meetings between the sides.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"332f6219514010fbaec026785486313440398d61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/332f6219514010fbaec026785486313440398d61/0_0_4256_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No lasagne for Spurs this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No lasagne for Spurs this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The European wooden spoon.</strong> Not content with competing to see who is Manchester United\u2019s least successful post-Fergie manager, Ralf Rangnick and David Moyes are also duking it out for the dubious honour of qualifying for the Europa Conference League. United, who visit Crystal Palace, are two points ahead but way behind on goal difference, so they need a win to be sure of making the Europa League, which is about their level these days. West Ham, who go to Brighton, seem much the better team without having the league results to show for it. They may have something in their eye as they say goodbye to Mark Noble.</p> <p><strong>The final relegation place.</strong> Norwich and Watford are doomed, Everton are safe, which leaves Burnley and Leeds. Both are on 35 points, with Burnley way ahead on goal difference and in much better form after benefiting from the no-manager bounce. They have 10 points from the last six games, twice as many as Leeds. Burnley are at home to Newcastle, whose new-found excellence is seldom seen on the road. Leeds visit Brentford, who have been superb since they signed Christian Eriksen. It\u2019s a lot easier to see Burnley getting something than Leeds, but the final day doesn\u2019t have much to do with logic. </p> <p>The closest thing to a dead rubber is at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea, who can only finish a distant third, welcome Watford, who are 19th and can\u2019t be shifted unless Norwich somehow beat Spurs. The final game is Leicester v Southampton, where nothing but pride and prize money is at stake. Leicester, who are ninth, may well leapfrog Wolves, though they could conceivably be caught by Brighton. Southampton are 15th and will stay there unless Everton better their result.</p> <p>If you\u2019d rather follow one of the two biggest games, do join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/may/22/manchester-city-v-aston-villa-premier-league-live\">Rob Smyth</a> for City-Villa or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/may/22/liverpool-v-wolves-premier-league-live\">Simon Burnton</a> for Liverpool-Wolves.

Seeing an inner group each morning who are also friends allows for chit-chat and relaxation as well as ongoing conversation regarding the team.</p> \n<p>Guardiola is a man of high intelligence and sensitivity. The Guardian has been told the latter characteristic, in particular, is a great strength because it allows a sixth sense regarding his players, his side, the opponent and the sport. But it can also be an achilles heel because Guardiola can spend valuable energy on immaterial issues, with exasperated friends sometimes advising him this is counter-productive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/100/top\"> \n <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> \n  <thead> \n   <tr> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> \n    <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> \n   </tr> \n  </thead> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man City</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">38</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">73</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">93</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Liverpool</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">38</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">68</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">92</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Chelsea</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">38</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">43</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">74</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Tottenham Hotspur</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">38</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">29</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">71</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr class=\" \"> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">5</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Arsenal</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--played\">38</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">13</td> \n    <td class=\"football-stat--points\">69</td> \n   </tr> \n  </tbody> \n </table> \n</figure> \n<p>If this season is rated City\u2019s finest for the excellence almost from first whistle to last, there is a recognition that for Guardiola and his staff the closing month or so was perhaps the toughest. City faced Liverpool (a 2-2 home draw) on 10 April, then Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final away leg. The Spanish city is hostile to Guardiola \u2013 not because of his Barcelona loyalties but his opinion regarding his native Catalonia\u2019s wish to be independent. This made the trip more attritional (City secured a semi-final berth) and three days later the side were at Wembley to play Liverpool again, for a place in the FA Cup final (they lost 3-2). Then, after three victorious league games (Brighton, Watford and Leeds) and the home semi-final leg against Real Madrid, it was back to the Spanish capital.</p> \n<p>There City were knocked out after the concession of two late Rodrygo strikes and Karim Benzema\u2019s extra-time winner, yet still Guardiola\u2019s team rallied from bitter disappointment to beat Newcastle 5-0 and Wolves 5-1 before last weekend\u2019s 2-2 draw at West Ham, keeping Liverpool at arm\u2019s length and setting up the Villa Sunday\u2019s win over Aston Villa.</p> \n<p>All of this is a function of how City are primed to succeed, with Guardiola the focal point. When sitting down for an interview with a Premier League broadcaster this season he offered an off-camera aside that was a telling insight. \u201cThey do not blame me at the club when I lose a game,\u201d the Guardian is told he said. \u201cThe people here come and ask what can be done to help me more.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"abfaf6bc57ef77e2efc2ff4457f98ff38798f750\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abfaf6bc57ef77e2efc2ff4457f98ff38798f750/0_137_3500_2350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola with Manchester City\u2019s sporting director Txiki Begiristain at training in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola with Manchester City\u2019s director of football Txiki Begiristain at training in March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Publicly Guardiola\u2019s mantra is that he has to win or the bell will toll for his tenure. But, although defeats are detested, more important to him is how the side perform because this is a function of the stability he and the club have in place. City are a super-slick entity who try to ensure that arguably the generation\u2019s best manager is given everything to harness his powers. Crucially players are not brought in without his agreement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/gerrard-says-goalkeeper-olsen-attacked-during-manchester-city-pitch-invasion\">Manchester City apologise after Villa\u2019s Olsen \u2018attacked\u2019 during pitch invasion</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Exhibit One. In August Cristiano Ronaldo was available and Guardiola wanted a proven prolific finisher. First Begiristain and his department assessed the Portuguese, then it was over to the manager. Guardiola was not convinced that a 36-year-old was right for the side and so no move was made. Ronaldo was considered only after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/25/harry-kane-confirms-he-will-be-staying-at-tottenham-this-summer-manchester-city\" title=\"\">failed pursuit of Harry Kane</a> as the ideal replacement for City\u2019s departed record goalscorer, Sergio Ag\u00fcero. When Tottenham signalled bids had to be north of \u00a3150m the club walked away and Guardiola ended the window without the dedicated centre-forward he wanted. His response was not to sulk but to get on with the job. The result was staggering. City have scored 99 league goals, five more than Liverpool and 16 more than they registered as last season\u2019s champions.</p> \n<p>Exhibit Two. Erling Haaland is 21, a serial goalscorer, and was available at a bargain price from Borussia Dortmund thanks to his circa \u20ac60m buyout clause. Real were the Norwegian\u2019s first choice but the Spanish champions pursued Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, only to miss out, and Haaland became an option for City. Again, over to Guardiola. Unsure initially, he came to warm to the player and green-lit the deal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/manchester-city-complete-erling-haaland-signing-from-borussia-dortmund\" title=\"\">brought Haaland to the club</a>.</p> \n<p>Throughout this campaign there has been no crisis point. There have been (very rare) duff displays: Guardiola was unhappy with January\u2019s 1-1 draw at Southampton and the 2-0 home loss to Crystal Palace. But despite having no recognised No 9 and losing the first-choice left-back, Benjamin Mendy, who was suspended indefinitely in August after being charged with rape and sexual assault, the response was supreme. There were only three league defeats \u2013 two by Tottenham \u2013 with 26 goals conceded against 32 last season. Twenty-three \u2013 in 2018-19 \u2013 is the only lower total under Guardiola.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b15ee34994bc6a85e9f3a8b6a3598b61397388b5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b15ee34994bc6a85e9f3a8b6a3598b61397388b5/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The form of Aymeric Laporte (left), battling here with Mohamed Salah, has repaid Pep Guardiola\u2019s faith in the defender.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The form of Aymeric Laporte (left), battling here with Mohamed Salah, has repaid Pep Guardiola\u2019s faith in the defender.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He was shrewd in other ways. Aymeric Laporte was reinstated alongside R\u00faben Dias in central defence after Guardiola spotted a subtle decline in John Stones, who was dropped despite last season\u2019s fine form. Laporte proved near-faultless.</p> \n<p>Liverpool pushed hard, coming from 14 points behind at one stage, yet Guardiola remained calm and confident. The serenity of his working environment is mirrored by the satisfaction he draws from a group of players which, it is understood, has pleasantly surprised him because, despite many working under him for five years or more, there is no battle fatigue. They continue to \u201crun and run\u201d, rather than become complacent, and accept personal responsibility for any downturn in performance.</p> \n<p>The end result: a fourth championship of a remarkable six years in east Manchester at a club built to ensure Guardiola can realise the most from his genius. This is why Manchester City are England\u2019s champion team once more.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/blog/2022/may/22/carrow-road-stroll-highlights-contes-transformation-of-tottenham", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T19:00:56Z", "webTitle": "Clinical Carrow Road win highlights Conte\u2019s transformation of Tottenham | Barney Ronay", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/22/carrow-road-stroll-highlights-contes-transformation-of-tottenham", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/may/22/carrow-road-stroll-highlights-contes-transformation-of-tottenham", "fields": {"headline": "Clinical Carrow Road win highlights Conte\u2019s transformation of Tottenham ", "trailText": "There was no repeat of Lasagna-gate as Spurs beat Norwich 5-0 to secure Champions League football next season", "body": "<p>At the end of this hazy, fun, end-of-term romp Antonio Conte could be seen striding out across the Carrow Road turf to join his players in front of the Tottenham support, who had spent the last hour basking and lolling and running through their repertoire of songs, serenading not just the players or the excellent transport links now in place for any potential trip back to Woolwich for their north London neighbours, but above all Conte himself.</p> <p>Conte had come to Norfolk sporting a kind of narrow-boat chic, blue leather yacht shoes, nautical slacks, navy sweater.

And for Conte this is a tangible feat of coaching on the hoof, albeit one that now poses its own questions to Tottenham\u2019s owners.</p> <p>For now, this was an afternoon when everything went right here for Spurs. At Carrow Road they met a Norwich team who weren\u2019t so much thinking about the beach as already dozing under a parasol with a detective novel over their eyes.</p> <p>By the end it had become a stroll, a beano on the Norfolk coast. A 5-0 win was capped by the most deliriously received moment of the afternoon as Son Heung-min pinged Spurs\u2019 fifth goal, and his second, into the top corner, to ensure he will share the Premier League Golden Boot with Mohamed Salah.</p> <p>It is an extraordinary achievement for Son, who doesn\u2019t take penalties, who has played in a brittle team under two different managers. He has a wonderful range in his game these days. Right now he would stroll into any team in the world.</p> <p>To a large extent, though, this is Conte\u2019s moment, a mark of his own enduring voodoo. Spurs have taken the third most points in the Premier League since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/02/tottenham-confirm-antonio-conte-as-new-manager\" title=\"\">he joined in November</a>. Spurs have made it back into the European overclass despite losing five of their first 10 games, despite an attempt to re-throw it away from January to March, despite the weirdly damp, mournful interlude under Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16a9b9423b763985ce8f718ce620b7da70aacd9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16a9b9423b763985ce8f718ce620b7da70aacd9e/0_139_3164_1899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dejan Kulusevski scores Tottenham\u2019s first goal against Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dejan Kulusevski scores Tottenham\u2019s first goal against Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Firing your manager in mid\u2011season may or may not be a panacea for deeper structural woes. But it helps if you can hire a coach whose genius is impetus, instant uplift, adrenal, fast-fix team-building and the ability to add spleen, guts, heart, teeth, a sense of robustness that was there in the Pochettino years, but somehow not quite like this.</p> <p>Carrow Road had been a lovely mild green and yellow place at kick off. Norwich attempted a series of what must, for want of a better word, be called \u201cattacks\u201d, but this is a team that\u2019s all stitching and no scissors. Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg paused then whumped the ball over the bar from 10 yards. Could it? Could this be a thing? Was it going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/bug-fails-to-upset-happy-conte-as-tottenham-aim-to-bag-fourth-spot\" title=\"\"><em>happen again</em></a>?</p> <p>No. It wasn\u2019t. Conte\u2019s team had one key advantage in those early exchanges. Dejan Kulusevski didn\u2019t seem to know he was playing for Spurs. Perhaps this can be beaten into him during pre\u2011season. But for now he is clearly under the impression he\u2019s playing for an upwardly mobile team with some fine players and a top coach.</p> <p>Kulusevski was supreme all afternoon, and scored the opening goal from a classically Conte move: a quick steal of the ball and an instant lofted pass from H\u00f8jbjerg. Rodrigo Bentancur took it perfectly on the outside of his foot, a delicate little nuzzle of a touch. He passed to Kulusevski, who buried it.</p> <p>These were two of Conte\u2019s January hires, scoring a Conte goal. With half an hour gone Bentancur was back at it, teeing up Kane for a headed second. Kulusevski made it three, cutting in from the left and scoring the third with a thrilling shot into the far corner. From there it was all Son. And now, well, what?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The battle for fourth place can often seem an overblown thing, a race for leftovers. But such are the margins this feels like something more. There is a sense of divvying up of the near future taking place. For Spurs the late Levy years had been in danger of a terminal drift, a squandering of hard won gains through miserliness, caution, weird managerial appointments.</p> <p>Success here is a corollary to a massive missed opportunity for Arsenal, who had no midweek football this season, who spent over \u00a3140m last summer, whose manager has had two full years at this. Spurs have all the tools now to build on this. But Conte will demand manpower, resources, advanced weaponry. For all the joys of Norwich in May, the summer will provide the test of just how high Spurs are willing to take this.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/live/2022/may/22/manchester-city-v-aston-villa-premier-league-live", "type": "liveblog", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T18:57:29Z", "webTitle": "Manchester City crowned Premier League champions after 3-2 win over Aston Villa \u2013 as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/may/22/manchester-city-v-aston-villa-premier-league-live", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2022/may/22/manchester-city-v-aston-villa-premier-league-live", "fields": {"headline": "Manchester City crowned Premier League champions after 3-2 win over Aston Villa \u2013 as it happened", "trailText": "The substitute Ilkay Gundogan scored twice as City came back from the brink to win the title in unforgettable circumstances ", "body": "<div id=\"block-628a86e78f08e35126babf1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-22T18:57:29.564Z\">7.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>We\u2019re going to wrap this blog up now</strong>.

In case you\u2019ve been at a digital retreat on the Kerguelen Islands for the last month, here\u2019s how the land lies. If City beat Villa they will be champions of England for the fourth time in five years, and Pep Guardiola will be a unique genius. If they don\u2019t, and Liverpool win against Wolves at Anfield, City will endure the nightmare of a trophyless season - not to mention a potential Liverpool quadruple - and Pep Guardiola will be just another bald fraud in a world full of them.</p> \n  <p>In an ideal world (arf!), every title race would go the wire. The inequality of modern football means it happens less and less. Even in England, where things are relatively competitive, this is only the ninth time it has occurred in 30 years of the Premier League. On the last four occasions, starting in 2012, City have been top of the league going into the final games. </p> \n  <p>You can trace the modern history of City, and the change in their DNA, through the extreme emotions of the last day. It could be an eight-part Netflix series, with a naff subtitle: <em>From Cityitis to City titles</em>.</p> \n  <p>Before Abu Dhabi, City were, well, what the acronym says. They lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/21/premier-league-relegation-david-pleat\">a relegation decider at home to Luton in 1982-83,</a> signed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/12/knowledge-playing-for-wrong-result\">their own death warrant by the corner flag in 1995-96</a> and put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/16/match.manchestercity\">a goalkeeper up front</a> before missing a last-minute penalty to qualify for the Uefa Cup in 2004-05.</p> \n  <p>My university friend and City fan Steve Buckley has generously pointed out some other comedy classics: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/09/manchester-city-yaya-toure-agent\">the Eddie Large fiasco at Bournemouth in 1988-89</a> (technically that was on the penultimate weekend, but it\u2019s too good to ignore, and what the hell let\u2019s have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/06/golden-own-goal-jamie-pollock-for-qpr-v-manchester-city-1998\">a bit of Jamie Pollock</a> while we\u2019re here) and <a href=\"https://www.mancity.com/news/club/city-dna-stuart-pearce-penalty-63726790\">Stuart Pearce missing a penalty freebie \u2013 with two goalscoring records at stake - in 2001-02</a>. A Harvard study proved categorically that, had Pearce been playing for any football club in Christendom at the time, he would have scored that penalty.</p> \n  <p>That was then and this is now. That was just nostalgia. City don\u2019t do comedy classics anymore, certainly not domestically. Their identity changed on 13 May 2012, like Dale Cooper being possessed by Killer BOB only in reverse, when they recovered from a potentially devastating strain of Cityitis to win the Premier League in uniquely euphoric circumstances. A part of Manchester City died that day, and their fans don\u2019t want it back.</p> \n  <p>On the next two occasions City needed a result in their final game to win the title, against West Ham in 2014 and Brighton in 2019, they dealt calmly with the pressure and had the job done after about an hour. All things being equal, it\u2019ll be the same today. But things aren\u2019t always equal in football, especially not on the final day. Villa getting a result is highly improbable, but it\u2019s not impossible.</p> \n  <p>For City, the presence of Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho and even Danny Ings at Villa has given this game an unnervingly whiffy narrative. The nightmare of Liverpool winning the league would be compounded if Gerrard was on the field at the final whistle, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyAUkaC6nsI\">cavorting in slip-on brogues like David Pleat in 1983</a>. But the unexpected return of Kyle Walker and John Stones will assuage the fear of watching Fernandinho, in his last game for the club, getting sent off for a professional foul on Ollie Watkins in the first 10 minutes.</p> \n  <p>Look, we shouldn\u2019t build this game up too much. Villa could get a result, but the likely scenario is that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTuPhfD3mYc\">Pep will be doing karaoke</a>, Brobdingnagian cigar in hand, by about 10pm. </p> \n  <p>The last day of the season has never been a time for nuance. There are only two ways this can go: another City title, or the return of Cityitis.</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick off</strong> 4pm.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-table\" data-canonical-url=\"https://frontend.gutools.co.uk/admin/football/tables/league/100/top\"> \n   <table data-embed-type=\"table\" class=\"table table--football table--striped\"> \n    <thead> \n     <tr> \n      <th class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\"><abbr title=\"Position\">Pos</abbr></th> \n      <th class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Team</th> \n      <th class=\"football-stat--played\"><abbr title=\"Played\">P</abbr></th> \n      <th class=\"football-stat--difference\"><abbr title=\"Goal difference\">GD</abbr></th> \n      <th class=\"football-stat--points\"><abbr title=\"Points\">Pts</abbr></th> \n     </tr> \n    </thead> \n    <tbody> \n     <tr class=\" \"> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">1</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Man City</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--played\">37</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">72</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--points\">90</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr class=\" \"> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">2</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Liverpool</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--played\">37</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">66</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--points\">89</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr class=\" \"> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">3</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Chelsea</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--played\">37</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">42</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--points\">71</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr class=\" \"> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">4</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Tottenham Hotspur</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--played\">37</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">24</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--points\">68</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr class=\" \"> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--postition table-column--sub\">5</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--team table-column--main\">Arsenal</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--played\">37</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--difference\">9</td> \n      <td class=\"football-stat--points\">66</td> \n     </tr> \n    </tbody> \n   </table> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/blog/2022/may/22/jesse-marsch-watches-leeds-united-nightmare-turn-into-american-dream", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T18:29:49Z", "webTitle": "Jesse Marsch watches Leeds United nightmare turn into American dream | Ed Aarons", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/22/jesse-marsch-watches-leeds-united-nightmare-turn-into-american-dream", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/may/22/jesse-marsch-watches-leeds-united-nightmare-turn-into-american-dream", "fields": {"headline": "Jesse Marsch watches Leeds United nightmare turn into American dream", "trailText": "Against the odds Leeds have survived a torrid season in the Premier League following a nerve-shredding win at Brentford", "body": "<p>As the Leeds players sprinted across the pitch to celebrate with their fans at the final whistle, Jesse Marsch had a moment to himself. After a nerve\u2011shredding afternoon during which the American went through every emotion watching his team eventually secure their Premier League status for another season, it must have felt like vindication.</p> <p>Having been given the unenviable task of replacing Marcelo Bielsa at the end of February after Leeds had conceded 21 goals in just six matches, it all seemed likely to end in tears for the man who lasted less than half a season at RB Leipzig in Germany this season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/leeds-escape-relegation-final-day-win-brentford-premier-league-match-report\">Leeds escape the drop as Harrison strike seals final-day win at Brentford </a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while his references to Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammad Ali drew unhelpful comparisons to the first American manager to grace the Premier League, at least Marsch has avoided the fate of Bob Bradley at Swansea. His reign lasted just 85 days and while David Wagner \u2013 born in Germany but a former US international \u2013 did well to keep Huddersfield up, the reputation of coaches from across the pond has not been impressive.</p> <p>Against opponents with nothing to play for and who were reduced to nine men for the last 15 minutes after Kristoffer Ajer had limped off and the substitute Sergio Canos was shown a red card, this was hardly a tactical masterclass from Marsch. Indeed, had Burnley found an equaliser at Turf Moor just before Jack Harrison\u2019s late winner then the situation could have been totally reversed. But, as Marsch himself acknowledged afterwards, it was all about surviving.</p> <p>\u201cThe stress has been high for three months but we never stopped believing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much been said about Marcelo Bielsa v me and there\u2019s been people counting us out. I get it, this is high\u2011level stuff, and fans pay attention all over the world. I appreciate the fans singing my name but that\u2019s not the important thing.\u201d</p> <p>The 1,725 visiting supporters in attendance certainly made themselves heard throughout, with renditions of \u201cMarching on Together\u201d booming out from the nearby Express Tavern hours before kick-off. Despite Ivan Toney\u2019s best efforts, there was little sign of the unlikely animosity between these two clubs that dates back to their battle for promotion in 2020. But if the Brentford forward\u2019s decision to retweet a video of Liam Cooper and Stuart Dallas singing \u201cmind the gap Thomas Frank\u201d was an attempt to rile the opposition, it seemed to have the desired effect as Leeds made a terribly sloppy start.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c44f19b53a1d5b69acf7597395861d859ece4b65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c44f19b53a1d5b69acf7597395861d859ece4b65/0_104_5568_3343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raphinha celebrates with the away fans after Leeds beat the drop at Brentford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raphinha celebrates with the away fans after Leeds beat the drop at Brentford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Diego Llorente looked relieved to see the ball run out of play after his clearance was charged down by Toney directly from kick-off before Liam Cooper and Illan Meslier got themselves in a tangle soon after. With Patrick Bamford missing because of Covid, it was up to the 20-year-old Joel Gelhardt to provide them with a spark in attack and the bustling former Wigan forward was unlucky to see his effort ruled out for offside.</p> <p>Just as they were getting over that disappointment, a section of Leeds fans got wind that Newcastle were ahead against Burnley thanks to Callum Wilson\u2019s penalty. Cue another roar. Jumping around on the touchline in a short-sleeved white shirt and kicking every ball, the news from Turf Moor also seemed to put an extra spring in the step of Marsch as he urged his players forward.</p> <p>While Leeds had spent just 22 days in the relegation zone all season, Brentford\u2019s only dalliance with trouble came after a winless eight-game run at the start of the year. The arrival of Christian Eriksen on a short-term deal quickly ended any of those fears, although with the Denmark midfielder\u2019s future still unclear Frank will be keen to avoid a similar fate to Sheffield United and Leeds after both flourished in their first season following promotion.</p> <p>Had one of Eriksen, Toney, Mathias Jensen or Bryan Mbeumo taken one of the chances that fell Brentford\u2019s way before the break then Marsch\u2019s half-time team talk may have been very different. With the onus on Burnley, Leeds began the second half on the back foot once more and were fortunate to see Mbeumo waste another great chance following a mazy dribble from Eriksen. At that stage it felt impossible that Leeds could keep them out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But within five minutes, somehow the momentum had swung completely the other way. First it was David Raya who turned from Brentford\u2019s hero to villain after a brilliant save to deny Rodrigo, only to then bring down Raphinha after presenting him with the ball. The Brazilian celebrated with the fans in the corner after holding his nerve from the spot, with news of Newcastle\u2019s second goal filtering through just as the match restarted. Suddenly, the great escape seemed almost complete as the travelling supporters urged each other to \u201csing your hearts out for the lads\u201d.</p> <p>Even then there was still time for another couple of twists. In a crazy few minutes, Brentford suddenly found themselves level thanks to Canos, Burnley pulled one back and then Harrison strode forward to seal his \u2013 and Marsch\u2019s \u2013 place in Leeds folklore.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "business/2022/may/22/boris-johnson-to-stress-work-as-the-fix-for-cost-of-living-crisis", "type": "article", "sectionId": "politics", "sectionName": "Politics", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T18:24:39Z", "webTitle": "Boris Johnson to stress work as the fix for cost of living crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/boris-johnson-to-stress-work-as-the-fix-for-cost-of-living-crisis", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/22/boris-johnson-to-stress-work-as-the-fix-for-cost-of-living-crisis", "fields": {"headline": "Boris Johnson to stress work as the fix for cost of living crisis", "trailText": "Ministers remain unable to decide on ways to help as energy firm boss warns soon 40% could be in fuel poverty", "body": "<p>Boris Johnson hopes to blunt calls for urgent action on the cost of living crisis by stressing that work is the best route out of poverty, as an energy firm boss warned that 40% of households could soon be in fuel poverty.</p> <p>No 10 sources confirmed on Sunday that the prime minister will continue to throw the spotlight on the healthy state of the job market, in the face of the rising clamour to help families struggling with their bills.</p> <p>Ministers have as yet been unable to agree what more should be done amid continued wrangling over the merits of a windfall tax, with Downing Street keen to stress the \u00a322bn that has already been spent on supporting households, and highlighting the need to grow the economy.</p> <p>Johnson told the Welsh Conservative conference on Friday: \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that you have to go all the way back to 1974 to find a time when the unemployment was as low in the UK as it is today, and whatever the difficulties that the post-Covid economy faces now, I just want you to dwell on that for a second.\u201d</p> <p>However, with wages failing to keep up with 9% annual inflation, many of those struggling to make ends meet are already in jobs.

Shakespeare has been influencing literature for over 400 years. It\u2019s right to teach Shakespeare. The ideas in Shakespeare are universal.\u201d</p> <p>She went on: \u201cI\u2019m worried about the trend in America that is now influencing what\u2019s happening over here, where eventually we will do away with cultural icons like Shakespeare.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, pupils in England are still required to study Shakespeare. Students sitting AQA GCSE English literature exams this summer will have studied one of Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing and Julius Caesar.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is the time will come where I don\u2019t think that will happen any more,\u201d said Birbalsingh. \u201cI think that in America he has been lost in many places. And we are following America in this way.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what would replace Shakespeare, she said: \u201cAny number of different black and female authors. Maybe they\u2019ll have me in there. The point is I\u2019m a black female author. I would never suggest reading my books instead of Shakespeare or Dickens or any number of other dead white men. My colour and my gender should not be so important.\u201d</p> <p>Birbalsingh stressed she was not saying she did not want to have any black authors on the curriculum but added: \u201cI disagree with this idea that you can only identify and appreciate an author who is of your skin colour. You should be able to appreciate anyone really, and what matters is how good they are.\u201d</p> <p>She said that pupils taking A-level English at Michaela study Andrea Levy\u2019s novel Small Island. \u201cI think it\u2019s excellent. So I\u2019m not saying only teach dead white men. I\u2019m just saying don\u2019t campaign to get rid of them.\u201d</p> <p>Birbalsingh has allowed cameras into her free school for the first time for a documentary on ITV entitled Britain\u2019s Strictest Headmistress, which aired on Sunday.</p> <p>She founded the Michaela community school eight years ago and it has since become the most talked-about education experiment in England.</p> <p>But far from being a warts-and-all portrait of a school and its controversial headteacher, it is an authored documentary in which she sets out her vision, not just for education but for raising children and making a better society.</p> <p>Her manifesto is based on 12 golden rules, which include: don\u2019t give children unsupervised access to the internet, teach them gratitude, keep your standards high, hold the line, and don\u2019t let them listen to grime or drill music because \u201cthat\u2019ll ruin their lives\u201d, she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhite middle-class people don\u2019t realise that, because their children can dip in and dip out and it\u2019s not an issue. Whereas your black kid in the inner city \u2013 it could literally destroy your life.\u201d</p> <p>Birbalsingh told the Guardian: \u201cThis isn\u2019t me saying, oh my goodness, parents are doing a terrible job. This is me saying, these things are going to help us all be better at raising children as a society.\u201d</p> <p>She first came to prominence at the 2010 Tory party conference where she made a speech about Britain\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d education system, which caused uproar among fellow teachers and cost her her job.</p> <p>Her school has become famous for its strict \u201cno excuses\u201d behaviour policy and its success \u2013 it was judged \u201coutstanding\u201d by Ofsted and in 2019 more than half of all GCSE grades were level 7 or above. Her many fans include Toby Young, Michael Gove and Peter Hitchens.</p> <p>She was appointed as the government\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/10/uks-strictest-headteacher-katharine-birbalsingh-made-social-mobility-chief\">Social Mobility Commissioner</a> and has attacked \u201cwoke culture\u201d, engaging in regular Twitter spats on any number of issues including white privilege, racism, Ofsted and original sin. Last month she was criticised after she suggested girls don\u2019t choose physics A-level because they dislike \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/27/girls-shun-physics-a-level-as-they-dislike-hard-maths-says-social-mobility-head\">hard maths</a>\u201d, comments she said were taken out of context.</p> <p>\u201cPeople misquote me,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople say all sorts of nonsense. I spent 20 minutes talking about the cultural issues for why girls might not choose STEM subjects.\u201d Besides, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should fulfil quotas. If I don\u2019t respect my girls well enough at 16 for us to say, \u2018No, you must do physics, because we need to have 50% girls doing physics\u2019, I just think that\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week Birbalsingh fought off her critics over a <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1611144/UK-strictest-headteacher-Churchill-row-london-school\">quotation</a> painted on an internal wall of the school, which an eagle-eyed observer spotted had been misattributed to Winston Churchill. She can see why people picked up on the mistake. \u201cBut demand a public apology? What? For something on the wall in my school? It\u2019s absurd.</p> <p>\u201cOf course point out a mistake. Laugh at it if you want. I don\u2019t understand what the big deal is. Yeah, we have a misattributed quote. We\u2019ll change it. Like, who cares?\u201d</p> <p>On white privilege, she acknowledges it exists, but says there are lots of other kinds of privilege, like \u201cpretty privilege\u201d, \u201ctall privilege\u201d and \u201cgood family privilege\u201d, and in any case, she says, it\u2019s damaging to black children to keep on about racism and white privilege in school.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all they ever hear on the outside.

Over the past two years young people have experienced isolation, disruption to their education and reduced access to support, including from counsellors and GPs. All of these things have massively impacted their mental health, but these figures are only the tip of the iceberg and will continue to rise.\u201d</p> <p>He said many young people were reaching crisis point before could get the treatment they need.</p> <p>Evidence from the children\u2019s commissioner for England has shown that while help from CAMHS is available within six days of being referred in certain areas, in other places families have to wait for as long as 81 days before their child is seen, despite some having self-harmed or had suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/03/swamped-nhs-mental-health-services-turning-away-children-say-doctors\">survey of GPs</a> published last month by the youth mental health charity stem4 found that half said CAMHS were rejecting half of referrals they made of under-18s suffering from anxiety, depression, conduct disorder and self-harm because their symptoms were not seen as severe enough. In one case a 12-year-old boy found with a ligature in his room was refused help because there were no marks on his neck.</p> <p>Nihara Krause, a consultant clinical psychologist and the founder of stem4, said that while more under-18s were getting help, it was unclear from the figures how many received effective treatment. \u201cTeachers and GPs say that children and mental health in mental health distress are either being rejected in record numbers because their difficulties do not meet the high threshold for treatment, or they are stuck on long waiting lists. These latest figures also lack any real detail to warrant claiming there has been a marked improvement in accessing effective treatment. They just show greater need.\u201d</p> <p>She said not just the prevalence but also the severity and complexity of youth mental health problems had increased in recent years. In addition, Covid-induced loneliness, increased time spent online, disrupted routines and exposure to family stress have increased levels of distress.</p> <p>Catherine Roche, the chief executive of Place2Be, which provides counselling to 450 primary and secondary schools across the UK containing 250,000 pupils, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen across our frontline services in UK schools is rising numbers of young people struggling with anxiety, self-harm, eating difficulties and suicidal thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>A survey of school heads and other staff by Place2Be and the National Association of Head Teachers published in February found that large majorities had seen increases in mental health problems among pupils since the start of the academic year, including low self-esteem (86%), depression (76%) and sustained feelings of anger (68%).</p> <p>Roche urged the NHS to provide many more early intervention services to support troubled young people as soon as they exhibit signs of distress, before their mental health deteriorates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national mental health director, said: \u201cThe toll of the pandemic has inevitably had an impact on the nation\u2019s mental health, with more young people than ever before accessing NHS services. As these figures show, demand continues to skyrocket, with a third more children treated in February this year compared to February 2020.\u201d</p> <p>She said the NHS had responded by expanding mental health teams in 4,700 schools and colleges and setting up 24/7 mental health crisis telephone support services for all ages, which now receive 20,000 calls a month.</p> <p>The NHS data also shows that mental health bed shortages mean some under-16s who are sick enough to be admitted for mental health care are having to be treated on adult mental health wards, despite guidance saying that should never happen.

That season Liverpool won the Champions League and, although the quadruple has again proved elusive, that prize perhaps awaits next weekend. There may be disappointment at having missed out on a historical achievement having come so close but, whatever happens against Real Madrid, this has been an astonishing season. There should be no recriminations.</p> <p>And yet the league was close. With 20 minutes to go it felt almost within Liverpool\u2019s grasp. As Anfield roared about events 35 miles to the east there was profound anxiety. In such circumstances, narrative, the sense that this was written, that it was meant to be, offers comfort.</p> <p>The possibility that Steven Gerrard might at last win the title for Liverpool had been teased almost to breaking point. But there was more. That, after all their spending, it might be (Matty) Cash that should undo City was almost too delicious. But from a Liverpool point of view there was also the fact that the cross for the Aston Villa full-back had been provided by the other full-back, Lucas Digne, who left Everton only in January because he had fallen out with Rafa Ben\u00edtez shortly before the Spaniard was sacked. Could this also be Ben\u00edtez securing a league title for what has always felt like his one true club?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca30d5eadaa0202d27ca509c28c6109ee772a13a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca30d5eadaa0202d27ca509c28c6109ee772a13a/0_153_4601_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp applauds the Liverpool fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A subdued J\u00fcrgen Klopp applauds the fans at Anfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps there were even memories of 75 years ago, when Liverpool, the team of Bob Paisley and Albert Stubbins, beat Wolves 2-1 on the final day of the season \u2013 albeit at Molineux and only because Stoke City subsequently lost at Sheffield United \u2013 to clinch the title.</p> <p>Was there any more narrative that could be heaped on top? It turned out there was, Philippe Coutinho adding the second for Villa at the Etihad. Coutinho has been a key figure in the creation of Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, his sale to Barcelona in effect funding the signings of Alisson and Virgil van Dijk. This felt almost too perfect, all the pieces falling snugly into place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But one thing remained. None of it mattered if Liverpool did not win. And for a long time that did not look likely. They were open at the back as they often are when Van Dijk is absent, lacking his fine judgment of when to spring the press and just how far to push up. That, and Ibrahima Konat\u00e9\u2019s strange error, cost them the opener but there were three or four other decent opportunities on the counter for Wolves. It hardly needs pointing out but Madrid are likely to be rather more clinical if Liverpool are as lax next week.</p> <p>At the same time there was a tension in possession. On a normal Sunday afternoon Liverpool would probably have swept Wolves away but here, with the line in sight, with so much at stake, the muscles just felt a little tighter, the passing a little less fluent, the mechanisms just a little gummy. Liverpool toiled, missing the injured Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara. The chances did not come quite as readily.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/crystal-palace-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Wilfried Zaha strike for Crystal Palace sinks woeful Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mohamed Salah did, eventually, put Liverpool ahead but by then the City comeback was already complete. By the time Andy Robertson confirmed the win the cheers were muted, thoughts already drifting to Paris. This was the ninth time in the Premier League era that the title race had gone to the final day and the ninth time the side that had started the day top had won. Overturning leads is difficult, in part because the league deliberately keeps the likely challengers apart on the final weekend.</p> <p>Would it have made a difference had Salah\u2019s goal come 10 minutes earlier? How would City have handled that pressure? Perhaps it would not have mattered. Gerrard coming close but not quite close enough in the league is itself a well-worn trope: this, in fact, does usually slip. But it would have been interesting to see.</p> <p>As it was, City had the mentality for the task that was set them. Mentality has been a strength of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool.

Here a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist who </em><em>until recently worked within NHS </em><em>child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) describes the frustrating and relentless daily battle to meet the soaring demand and help those most in need.</em></p> <p>Until last year I worked as a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist within the NHS CAMHS service. I had dedicated 20 years of my life to reach that position, and worked in a speciality close to my heart.</p> <p>I first became interested in child psychiatry as a 12-year-old when I spent my summer volunteering in a Romanian orphanage. There I saw first-hand the effects of trauma and neglect upon mental health and child development. I knew this was the field of work I wanted to work in, and hoped that early intervention would have a profound impact upon the outcomes of children who need help.</p> <p>But after 15 years working in the NHS alongside extremely dedicated and committed colleagues, I made the difficult decision to resign because I could no longer be part of a system which is clearly broken, and no longer able to provide the early intervention that is so vital in so many cases.</p> <p>While CAMHS has been stretched for many years, with lengthy waiting times and limited availability of therapeutic services, the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath has ground the service to a halt.</p> <p>Waiting times increased in some cases from one year to three years. Many children are now being told they do not meet the threshold for CAMHS, despite being suicidal or restricting their eating to dangerously low levels. One young autistic girl with eating difficulties had struggled to get any help because of the huge demand for treatment. By the time I saw her in CAMHS, her mother told me she was eating only one stick of celery a day. Sadly, she was one of many in the same position.</p> <p>As well as acute mental health problems, similar difficulties are experienced by families seeking a diagnosis for autism and ADHD. Many of them were not considered \u201chigh risk\u201d and therefore not prioritised. Many girls on the autism spectrum often do not even make it to the assessment stages, because they are being screened out by CAMHS questionnaires that often don\u2019t identify autism among high-functioning girls.</p> <p>While this may help reduce waiting lists, for many girls it leads to a lack of understanding about their underlying neurodevelopmental difficulties and culminates in a plethora of co-morbid mental health difficulties such as self-harm and anxiety disorder.</p> <p>I shared the same frustrations as many of my CAMHS patients, who had in many cases waited years to see me.

Addressing that sobering reality is a challenge not only for the government and the NHS but for society as a whole. Evidence for the ongoing deterioration in youth wellbeing is detailed, considerable and overwhelming.</p> <p>The Children\u2019s Society has found that happiness levels among children and young people have declined to the extent that 7% of 10- to 15-year-olds in the UK are unhappy with their lives. They identify school, appearance and friends as the main drivers of their discontent. Experts also cite other reasons for the fact that growing numbers of school-age children are unhappy \u2013 bullying, problems at home, sexual assault and damage inflicted by social media to name but a few.</p> <p>Concern about the phenomenon had been growing for years before Covid struck in March 2020, and the pandemic has made a bad situation an awful lot worse. NHS Digital\u2019s most recent survey of the mental heath of children and young people in England, published last September and based on data collected in February and March 2021, provided stark evidence of the sharp downturn. There were 534,000 under-18s in touch with services before the pandemic, a figure that has risen to 650,000.</p> <p>Rates of probable mental disorders among six- to 16-year-olds increased from 11.6%, or one in nine, in 2017 to 17.4%, or one in six, the health service\u2019s statistical research agency found. Among the same age group, 39.2% experienced a downturn in their mental health while only 21.8% reported an improvement. Among 17- to 23-year-olds the picture was even more pronounced: 52.5% said their mental health had declined and only 15.2% that it had improved. The proportion with possible eating problems had also risen in both age groups.</p> <p>About 1.5 million under-18s will need new or extra help with their mental health as a direct result of Covid, according to the Centre for Mental Health thinktank. The record 420,314 young people being treated every month by NHS services are likely to be part of the total, but even if they all are that still leaves almost 1.1 million more yet to seek help.</p> <p>Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), however, are already unable to help all those seeking care. Many would-be patients are rejected for not being ill enough despite their distress, vulnerability and worrying behaviour \u2013 backdoor rationing to try to reduce the huge pressure on the system. Delays of as long as 81 days await those who are deemed eligible. Given the lack of capacity, what chance does this Covid-induced wave of new cases have of getting the treatment they need?</p> <p>There are some hopeful signs. The money going into children\u2019s mental heath services is rising. NHS England is making good progress in using new support teams to provide help in schools and colleges with problems such as anxiety and depression. Claire Murdoch, the NHS\u2019s national mental health director, is passionately committed to improving the situation.</p> <p>The Commons health select committee noted last December that \u201cthe number of young people receiving treatment has risen from just 25% to around 40% of those with a diagnosable condition pre-pandemic\u201d. But, the MPs added, \u201cit is not acceptable that more than half of young people do not receive the mental health support they need\u201d \u2013 a damning observation.</p> <p>The NHS is increasingly characterised by care gaps \u2013 the mismatch between needs and its ability to meet them quickly \u2013 as illustrated by the long waits for elective surgery, GP appointments, A&amp;E treatment and ambulances to arrive. CAMHS is another case in point. </p> <p>It is hampered in its ability to offer fast, high-quality and appropriate care to all who need it by its longstanding lack of everything needed to run a responsive service: staff, community-based teams to keep people out of hospital and beds for those ill enough to need a spell as an inpatient. </p> <p>Given that, and Covid\u2019s devastating impact on our collective mental health, it would be naive to expect the NHS to be able to treat the pandemic\u2019s many young casualties any better and any more quickly than it can now.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "film/2022/may/22/forever-young-endlessly-tedious-story-of-self-involved-drama-students", "type": "article", "sectionId": "film", "sectionName": "Film", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T17:55:47Z", "webTitle": "Forever Young review - endlessly tedious story of self-involved drama students", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/22/forever-young-endlessly-tedious-story-of-self-involved-drama-students", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/22/forever-young-endlessly-tedious-story-of-self-involved-drama-students", "fields": {"headline": "Forever Young review - endlessly tedious story of self-involved drama students", "trailText": "Valerie Bruni-Tedeschi\u2019s latest Cannes lock-in is a woeful soap about aspiring actors in 80s Paris with neither the songs \u2013 or the soul \u2013 of Alan Parker\u2019s Fame", "body": "<p>Endless drama, perpetual pouting and nonstop narcissism in this epically tiresome movie from director Valerie Bruni-Tedeschi and screenwriter Agnes De Sacy about a generation of highly-strung and mercurially talented young drama students in the 1980s who are admitted to the prestigious acting school at Patrice Ch\u00e9reau\u2019s Theatre Des Amandiers in Nanterre.<br><br>Among the ranks of yearning and deeply serious hopefuls, Stella (Nadia Tereszkiewicz) is a passionate blonde star who is sort of embarrassed about the hugely wealthy home she comes from; Ad\u00e8le (Clara Bretheau) is the rebellious, wacky figure who doesn\u2019t wear knickers at the audition; Victor (Vassily Schneider) is a sweet-natured, klutzy boy; \u00c9tienne (Sofiane Bennacer) is the smack-addicted guy who starts going out with Stella, and his moody image and habit of shouting \u201cStella!\u201d earn him the nickname Marlon Brando \u2014 the film\u2019s one genuinely humorous moment.<br><br>The drama teacher Pierre Romans is played by Micha Lescot, and the legendary Ch\u00e9reau is played with much smouldering imperious charisma by Louis Garrel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-pa9jaJcTk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J-pa9jaJcTk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This is a strange, overwrought setup, though perhaps quite accurately drawn, in which the students are in a permanent state of emotional meltdown. \u00c9tienne introduces his teacher Pierre to smack and the supposed authority figure gets completely out of it in the middle of a rehearsal. As for Ch\u00e9reau himself, he is a huge cocaine enthusiast, and is shown snorting a massive line in the middle of the working day. The fact that all these students are sleeping with each other means that news of an HIV positive diagnosis creates a great spasm of shrieking anxiety and three of them are shown cramming into a single phone box to get the news of an Aids test. But this whole subject is treated with far less seriousness than a movie like, say, Robin Campillo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/20/120-beats-per-minute-review-passionate-and-defiant-account-of-80s-aids-activism\">120 BPM</a> and these young people don\u2019t really appear to care about anything or anyone other than themselves.<br><br>With a subject like this, the shadow of Alan Parker\u2019s Fame is never far away, and it is maybe too easy to mock. But what is exasperating about the film is its reluctance to dramatise the teaching: to show the young people themselves simply getting better at acting. They are doing a performance of Chekhov\u2019s Platonov, one of whose themes is the fragility and impermanence of youth. But their relationship to Chekhov is not taken seriously: the play simply provides incidental scenes and a backdrop to the silly, soap-operatic uproar.<br></p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "football/live/2022/may/22/liverpool-v-wolves-premier-league-live", "type": "liveblog", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T17:49:03Z", "webTitle": "Liverpool pipped to title despite 3-1 win over Wolves: Premier League \u2013 as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/may/22/liverpool-v-wolves-premier-league-live", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2022/may/22/liverpool-v-wolves-premier-league-live", "fields": {"headline": "Liverpool pipped to title despite 3-1 win over Wolves: Premier League \u2013 as it happened", "trailText": "Liverpool came from behind to beat Wolves but it was only good enough for second place on a dramatic, tense final day of the Premier League season", "body": "<div id=\"block-628a774b8f08e35126babe89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-22T17:49:03.992Z\">6.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Manchester City\u2019s players </strong>bouncing upon a stage with the Premier League trophy seems as good a prompt as any to close this blog down.

Real Madrid are the opposition in Paris next Saturday but Manchester City stand in the way of Klopp and Liverpool first, and the challenge is an exciting one for a man who has already won one Premier League and two Bundesliga titles. The weekly battle to match Pep Guardiola\u2019s side is keeping Klopp invigorated, knowing he and his team have been consistently at their best.</p> <p>Klopp knows the pain of 2018-19 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/12/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-title\">City pipped Liverpool to top spot</a>. Once again it goes down to the final day of the season, with Liverpool realistically needing to beat Wolves and for City to drop points against Steven Gerrard\u2019s Aston Villa. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to have had a few exciting times,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIf you ask my missus she asks why [does it] always go down to the last match. It happens incredibly often. It\u2019s the most exciting because seeing how good the boys are and seeing the steps that we\u2019ve made and just two games to go. It\u2019s unbelievable. It feels like five minutes ago it was seven games. Now, wham, here we go to two finals.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Much more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/21/jurgen-klopp-wham-two-finals-its-the-most-exciting-time-of-my-career\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp: \u2018Wham, two finals \u2013 it\u2019s the most exciting time of my career\u2019</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "film/2022/may/22/holy-spider-review-iranian-thriller-takes-real-case-and-makes-it-implausible", "type": "article", "sectionId": "film", "sectionName": "Film", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T17:45:56Z", "webTitle": "Holy Spider review \u2013 Iranian crime thriller takes real case and makes it implausible", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/22/holy-spider-review-iranian-thriller-takes-real-case-and-makes-it-implausible", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/22/holy-spider-review-iranian-thriller-takes-real-case-and-makes-it-implausible", "fields": {"headline": "Holy Spider review \u2013 Iranian crime thriller takes real case and makes it implausible", "trailText": "Twenty years after a serial killer murdered 16 sex workers in Mashad, Ali Abbasi has made a strangely fictionalised account of his capture and trial", "body": "<p>Holy Spider is a serial killer procedural which takes the procedure further than usual, despite its deployment of some pretty familiar tropes. It goes beyond the denouement and the arrest, extending the murderer\u2019s conceited theatre of cruelty to the police cell, the law courts and the media arena.</p> <p>This is a fictionalised true-crime drama-thriller based on Iranian construction worker Saeed Hanaei, nicknamed \u201cSpider Killer\u201d in the press, who in 2001 was arrested for the murder of 16 sex workers in the northeastern city of Mashad, and became a folk hero to the religious right for claiming to be on a holy mission to cleanse the city of prostitution. (Hanaei has already been the subject of a documentary and another feature film.)</p> <p>Sitting down to this drama, I wondered if director and co-writer Ali Abbasi, known for his 2018 body-horror satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/07/border-review-ali-abbasi\">Border</a>, might follow the example of historian Hallie Rubenhold whose book on Jack the Ripper focused on the identities of the women victims and revealed them to be far more complex human beings that the male ripperology industry had ever allowed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9dc11691271b8e5ca661bcc19c5cdba48ff8aa6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dc11691271b8e5ca661bcc19c5cdba48ff8aa6e/0_0_4446_1856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holy Spider.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"417\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holy Spider.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, not exactly, no. Despite some intimate vignettes showing the women\u2019s grim existences and a genuinely moving moment when the father of one bursts into tears at the thought of his daughter\u2019s wasted life, this sticks to a rather Hollywoodised, but certainly very effective killer-centric script. We see Saeed himself, played by Mehdi Bajestani, an angry and conflicted building-site worker who in one scene is shown taking a fearsome sledgehammer to a wall. He is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and despises himself for not having been more of a hero, or a martyr.</p> <p>But the woman who takes centre stage is a fictional investigative journalist from Tehran, Rahimi (Zar Emir-Ebrahimi) who shows up in Mashad wanting to crack this long-running case, and of course it is her view, and the movie\u2019s view, that the police have been notably lackadaisical in catching the killer because the cops and the judiciary and the culprit himself are all part of the same patriarchal mindset.</p> <p>Rahimi befriends a dishevelled, well-meaning local reporter (Arash Ashtiani) \u2013 evidently another invention, or at any rate composite \u2013 whom the Spider has been calling from a payphone to make sure his exploits are fully publicised. Together this odd couple talk to the sneering, sexist police chief Rostami (Sina Parvaneh) who wilfully misreads rumours about the #MeToo situation Rahimi had been in with her editor back in Tehran, believing instead that she is a woman of loose morals that he can sexually harass with impunity. Eventually, the question arises: how on earth is Rahimi going to confront this psychotic assailant? By being the bait of course \u2014 Rahimi is going to have to pretend to be a sex worker in the Schraderesque streets that Spider Killer is known to frequent; she will go back to his flat with him, while her reporter pal follows in secret.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"094e94555bb5c5a788383817d6dc112d51ac1359\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/094e94555bb5c5a788383817d6dc112d51ac1359/77_0_3092_1856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HOLY SPIDER film still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holy Spider.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a time-honoured and slightly preposterous narrative device. But what happens if for some reason Rahimi\u2019s journalist ally can\u2019t help her and she is left alone with a big, aggressive guy who is practised in violence? Rahimi has no training in martial arts and all she appears to have on her is a knife.</p> <p>There is a definite implausibility factor here, but the movie\u2019s final act, showing Saeed\u2019s eerie self-possession and unrepentant defiance in the dock, is nicely managed, right up to the black cap moment itself \u2014 although here again, Abbasi has exercised a bit of artistic licence. Holy Spider is certainly a lot brasher in its treatment of sex work in the theocratic state of Iran than a movie like, say, Jafar Panahi\u2019s The Circle (2000). Abbasi undoubtedly conveys the brutal attitudes which create victimhood.<br><br></p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "australia-news/2022/may/22/how-knocking-on-90000-doors-delivered-queensland-labor-heartland-to-the-greens", "type": "article", "sectionId": "australia-news", "sectionName": "Australia news", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T17:37:40Z", "webTitle": "How knocking on 90,000 doors delivered Queensland Labor heartland to the Greens ", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/how-knocking-on-90000-doors-delivered-queensland-labor-heartland-to-the-greens", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/how-knocking-on-90000-doors-delivered-queensland-labor-heartland-to-the-greens", "fields": {"headline": "How knocking on 90,000 doors delivered Queensland Labor heartland to the Greens ", "trailText": "Analysis: the party\u2019s stunning election result \u2013 likely winning three seats in Brisbane \u2013 built on a years-long grassroots strategy", "body": "<p>More than six years ago, the Greens began a political experiment in south Brisbane: they sought to build a never-ending door-knocking campaign in the city\u2019s most progressive inner suburbs.</p> <p>The party\u2019s stunning election result on Saturday \u2013 likely winning three lower house seats in Brisbane \u2013 is no sudden political shock to the Greens themselves.

Such trigger laws are legally written in such a way that they would come into effect the second that the constitutional right to an abortion embodied in Roe were overturned.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/roe-v-wade-abortion-supreme-court-draft-opinion\">a draft majority opinion</a> of the supreme court written by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to Politico.

It can still be 2019 all over again by winning the Champions League in Paris next Saturday, although with Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara hobbling through the lap of honour with a serious-looking injury and Divock Origi already ruled out with a muscle problem, regret was not confined to the final league table for Klopp.</p> \n<p>Anfield delivered a wild ride from the outset. Thousands lined Anfield Road to greet the Liverpool team coach before kick\u2011off and the atmosphere crackled as Klopp\u2019s players emerged for the warm-up, more in hope than expectation at that stage. Then Anfield fell silent when Pedro Neto swept the visitors ahead in only the third minute.</p> \n<p>The possibility of Wolves taking points from Liverpool, having lost eight of their previous 13 Premier League games, had barely received a mention in the final\u2011day narrative. But the hosts received a rude awakening after switching off at a Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 goal-kick. Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 misread the flight of the Wolves keeper\u2019s clearance and the ball sailed through to release Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, who glanced across to see Neto sprinting unmarked into the area and centred for his strike partner to convert past Alisson. The Liverpool keeper was denied a club record\u2011equalling 21st clean sheet of the season in the process, although ultimately shared the Golden Gloves award with Ederson on 20.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65be9868-c775-4759-b662-ae453641b0dd\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Liverpool responded with an energetic, threatening display, albeit while looking nervous in central defence without Virgil van Dijk, who was named on the bench alongside Salah. They were particularly vulnerable to the R\u00faben Neves ploy of sweeping first\u2011time passes out to Neto on the left at every opportunity.</p> \n<p>Jo\u00ebl Matip, Luis D\u00edaz and Naby Ke\u00efta all went close to an equaliser but Leander Dendoncker should have doubled the visitors\u2019 lead when Neto found the midfielder arriving at the near post. Dendoncker found the Kop instead of the target.</p> \n<p>Then it turned. Neto, a constant thorn to the Liverpool defence, limped off injured to be replaced by Hwang Hee-chan. Two minutes later Liverpool levelled courtesy of a sublime piece of skill from Thiago. Receiving Konat\u00e9\u2019s pass with his back to goal, Thiago unlocked the Wolves defence with a first-time reverse flick through the legs of Willy Boly. Sadio Man\u00e9 was away and finished inside S\u00e1\u2019s near post.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/leeds-escape-relegation-final-day-win-brentford-premier-league-match-report\">Leeds escape the drop as Harrison strike seals final-day win at Brentford </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>News of Villa\u2019s opener filtered through shortly afterwards, sparking pandemonium and the first chorus of \u201cSteve Gerrard, Gerrard\u201d.</p> \n<p>The mood was punctured, however, when Thiago pulled up after overhitting a crossfield ball towards Trent Alexander-Arnold and had to be replaced at the interval by James Milner. Wolves had their injury problems too with S\u00e1 suffering a leg injury that forced John Ruddy to replace the first-choice keeper. The visitors defended impressively, however, and despite news of Philippe Coutinho extending Villa\u2019s lead the resilience of Boly, Conor Coady and Toti Gomes represented a formidable obstacle to Liverpool\u2019s title ambitions. Wolves could have intensified Liverpool\u2019s anxiety but Hwang, Jim\u00e9nez and Dendoncker all wasted excellent openings on the counterattack.</p> \n<p>Man\u00e9 beat Ruddy with a delightful chip when released inside the box by Diogo Jota but was ruled offside. Liverpool claimed the lead that could have given them the title with six minutes remaining when Matip met Alexander-Arnold\u2019s corner with a towering header that Jim\u00e9nez blocked on the goalline. Ruddy scooped the ball away as far as Matip, who won the second header for Salah to turn home at close range.

Nevertheless, it was clearly all-consuming and terrible. Cleo had a lot going for her on the surface: she was attractive, young, successful in her career as a publicist, and in a stable relationship with a concerned partner. Yet she sat slumped in the chair across from me, tears streaming, palpably suffering.</p> <p>I felt at a loss to make sense of her deeply depressed mood but knew better than to ask Cleo to explain it. She had already told me that it was inexplicable to her too \u2013 and this made it harder to bear, as she felt she had no legitimate \u201cexcuse\u201d to be feeling how she did. \u201cIt\u2019s like I have all the ingredients for happiness, but I can\u2019t seem to bake the cake,\u201d she lamented. \u201cAnd then I feel useless.\u201d</p> <p>Cleo\u2019s experience is not that unusual. While for some depression is catalysed by a specific set of circumstances \u2013 unemployment, a painful break-up, loneliness, financial stress \u2013 for others it is a cloud that descends, seemingly for no reason, and drains the world of colour. This is not to say that there really is no reason, but rather that the causes are less easily identifiable. Gradually unearthing these reasons and helping Cleo to process them would prove to be a big part of our work together. However, first I needed to empathise with her and validate her distress and let her know that she did not have to be alone with it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Medication is not always a silver bullet for those who are depressed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time Cleo left that first session she was feeling some relief. We hadn\u2019t figured out the source of her pain or found a solution for it, but the very act of talking about it in a supportive environment and feeling that I could connect with how she was feeling, was enough to provide some comfort. I encouraged her to do a little exercise if she could, as we know exercise acts as a natural antidepressant. I didn\u2019t make any other suggestions as I didn\u2019t want her to feel like a failure if she was unable to follow through on them.</p> <p>Engaging her in a therapeutic relationship seemed more valuable at this point than providing her with a list of strategies, many of which she had no doubt tried already as friends and family had been giving her much so-called good advice. Depressed people usually know what they should be doing \u2013 but they lack the will or energy to do it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/28/if-we-all-talked-about-suicide-wouldnt-that-be-better-for-everyone\">If we all talked about suicide, wouldn\u2019t that be better for everyone? | Xavier Mulenga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of this advice had centred around antidepressant medication, and there is significant research demonstrating that a combination of medication and therapy provide a good outcome for many sufferers of depression. However, medication is not always a silver bullet, and the benefits must be weighed up against the potential side effects. I usually engage in a discussion about this with patients, but Cleo had signalled very early on that she was resistant to the idea of medication.</p> <p>Cleo\u2019s plight was on my mind as I was driving home from work that night, listening to the evening news. It occurred to me that many of us might describe ourselves as depressed by the current state of the world, with news stories dominated by climate catastrophes, war and disease. There is a collective sense of depression in the face of this; a heavier, wearier, darker social energy than the refractory anxiety we experienced at a communal level in the early days of the pandemic. But while many of us might use the term depression in response to this, we use it in the colloquial sense.</p> <p>Colloquially the word has come to be synonymous with feeling down, disappointed, sad. But true depression in the clinical sense is much more than this. It involves a protracted period in which one feels persistently low in mood and largely disinterested in previously pleasurable activities. This is accompanied by feelings of hopelessness, emptiness, social withdrawal, difficulty concentrating and maintaining personal hygiene, sleep disturbances and, not uncommonly, suicidal thoughts. This was Cleo\u2019s level of depression, and my heart went out to her.</p> <p>As with most psychological difficulties, the full explanation for Cleo\u2019s difficulties was complex. Her mother had a long history of depressed mood and Cleo might have inherited this vulnerability. In addition, she had a harsh internal critical voice, which constantly berated her for not being good enough. We connected this to her relationship with her father, who believed that criticism motivated children to achieve, and it had.</p> <p>But achievement wasn\u2019t the issue. For Cleo, it was a hollow achievement in which she never felt secure. Her internal pressure escalated in the context of winning her dream job, a job she loved but never felt confident that she deserved. And the social changes wrought by Covid hadn\u2019t helped, as now she was mostly working from home and was unable to access support and feedback in the same way she might have if she was working alongside her team.</p> <p>A constellation of these genetic, psychological and social factors provided the perfect breeding ground for Cleo\u2019s depression. Added to this was an unconscious rage, which is not uncommon in depression, a rage Cleo felt towards her father but was too afraid to express. Instead, she channelled it into berating herself for her failures, including failing to be happy.</p> <p>While it was a comfort to Cleo to make sense of her struggle, this didn\u2019t instantly fix the problem. Slowly, she had to own her internal conflicts and her anger and to develop a more compassionate and supportive internal voice. External changes were also needed. Thus, Cleo began spending more days in the office with her colleagues.

At the time, the harsh orders were of little concern to Ghassan Amoun: he was in prison then.</p> <p>In December 2020, however, NSW police did apply to slap an order on Amoun. He had a significant criminal history and was the brother of Bassam Hamzy, who founded the Brothers 4 Life gang.</p> <p>Justice Peter Garling granted the order and issued a troubling portent for things to come, saying there were \u201crival families \u2026 sorting out their differences between themselves in a violent manner and without engaging with the police\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a course of conduct of rampant serious and violent criminality, involving members of the [Hamzy] family on one side and members of the Alameddine family on the other, occurring in public and intended \u2026 to inflict violent retaliation upon each other for perceived crimes and slights.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst the publicity about these events, the intense police investigations which are occurring, and, perhaps, the existence of these proceedings, has led to a pause in these retaliatory attacks, there is no reason to think that the disputes have been finished and settled for all time.\u201d</p> <p>On a sunny day this January, while he sat inside a car in South Wentworthville, Amoun was shot dead.

But an opportunity for what, exactly, depends on whom you speak to.</p> <p>Those who think courts are not hard enough say these are inflection points, where crooks could be sent inside for longer rather than set free to cause more trouble.</p> <p>Those who believe early intervention can prevent a life of crime believe these are missed chances for a child to get the help they need.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60d4dd4dec2132403d62b1afbcb45bc7d79540e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60d4dd4dec2132403d62b1afbcb45bc7d79540e8/0_128_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Toole\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NSW police minister Paul Toole has promised another crackdown on gun crime but to what end?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bianca de Marchi/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some criminal syndicates actively court teenagers, police sources say, offering them relatively small amounts of money such as a few hundred dollar to complete minor logistical tasks.

But modern footballers generally don\u2019t respond to that sort of talk. They talk about connection, about vulnerability, about walking into the club on a Monday with a smile, irrespective of the weekend\u2019s result. Ask any teacher, coach or parent of a teenager whether that stuff resonates anymore, and they\u2019ll laugh, just like Boyle laughed at Sheedy. It\u2019s a very different society, and a very different generation of footballers.</p> <p>The old legends, and plenty of Essendon supporters, hate it of course. They want these guys to bleed. They want them to go to war. They want tortured apologies when a player shirks a contest. They ask, as Matthew Lloyd did last week, \u201cwhere has the nastiness gone?\u201d</p> <p>When Dylan Shiel was mocked by his Sydney opponent, it fitted neatly with the view that Essendon is too nice, that it\u2019s playing with plasticine. He was straight from central casting \u2013 he makes good money, he\u2019s down on form, and he doesn\u2019t play a particularly robust game.</p> <p>There was talk of \u2018mental disintegration\u2019 and of \u2018humiliation\u2019. Many pundits had a few bob each way. They spent half the week talking about the need to protect the head, mispronouncing the word \u2018sacrosanct\u2019 and lamenting the number of former champions whose brains are ruined. They spent the other half pining for the days when men like Ronnie Andrews settled scores at Windy Hill. Lloyd himself weighed in from the Channel Nine studio. \u201cI would have ploughed straight through Parker,\u201d he said, \u201cand got him to the ground and said \u2018you will never treat me like that again.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All week Essendon had been labelled soft, weak, and pathetic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The football field has never been safer. But the way we report on and frame the sport is pitiless. The football world loves a pile-on. As Shiel walked into training, the snouts of microphones were shoved in his face. He probably felt like one of those rogue plumbers on A Current Affair. The captain went on \u2018The Couch\u2019, not exactly football\u2019s most relaxed piece of furniture. He dropped a few F-bombs and defended his coach and teammates. The coach himself was bailed up by Channel Seven\u2019s Tom Browne. \u201cWhat do you make of this noise that he\u2019s playing scared,\u201d Browne asked. Such is the lot of the senior coach when your team is underperforming. You have to look people like that in the eye, try and keep a straight face, resist the urge to get physical, and somehow protect both player and brand.</p> <p>On May 18, 1974, at half-time of an Essendon-Richmond game, one of the most infamous brawls in the history of football broke out. Sheedy was playing for Richmond. Andrews copped a six week suspension, and would probably get six years these days. A six-year old kid wandered into the middle of it all. A dozen policemen had to break it up. That evening, Gough Whitlam defeated Billy Snedden in a federal election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/afl-grand-final-to-return-to-traditional-time-slot-at-mcg-in-win-for-fans\">AFL grand final to return to traditional time slot at MCG in win for fans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forty-eight years later, as Australia voted out a prime minister, the two sides met again. All week Essendon had been labelled soft, weak and pathetic. They finally flew the flag. They tackled. They pushed and shoved when remonstration was called for. At no point did they mentally disintegrate. But they never looked like winning. They dropped chest marks. They had no forward targets. Yes, they brought effort. But as Damian Hardwick told his players before the 2019 grand final: \u201cwe can take any bastard\u2019s best shot \u2026 and then we start to steamroll.\u201d</p> <p>And so, come Monday morning, the cycle repeats. The president will address a membership base that\u2019s at its wits end. Another review looms. When you\u2019re a big, polarising club, and nothing\u2019s going right, it can feel like the footy world\u2019s closing in on you. There\u2019s almost a sense of violation. Why do you have to be like <em>this</em>? What\u2019s <em>wrong</em> with you? Just bring some fucking <em>effort</em>.</p> <p>But when the effort comes, and the scoreboard doesn\u2019t budge, there\u2019s only reality. This Essendon side simply isn\u2019t very good. They\u2019ve been grossly overrated by the football world, and perhaps by themselves. They\u2019re easy to play and coach against. There\u2019s a dearth of big, mature bodies, and on-field leaders. They\u2019re years away from contending for a flag. </p> <p>For many, the answer lies in the past \u2013 in the Essendon of old, in statements like \u201cwe exist to win premierships\u201d, in bringing back the mongrel, even in bringing back James Hird. Carlton, Richmond, and Melbourne wasted decades talking like that. They finally grasped that it takes time, patience, the ability to identify and nurture generational talent, competent and stable leadership, a coherent plan, and a firm resolve not to deviate from it. Essendon\u2019s recent history of hitting those markers is probably reflected in its current ladder position. </p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "australia-news/2022/may/23/how-albaneses-practical-pivot-on-climate-paved-the-way-for-a-greens-surge", "type": "article", "sectionId": "australia-news", "sectionName": "Australia news", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T17:30:07Z", "webTitle": "How Albanese\u2019s practical pivot on climate paved the way for a Greens surge | Katharine Murphy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/how-albaneses-practical-pivot-on-climate-paved-the-way-for-a-greens-surge", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/how-albaneses-practical-pivot-on-climate-paved-the-way-for-a-greens-surge", "fields": {"headline": "How Albanese\u2019s practical pivot on climate paved the way for a Greens surge", "trailText": "<strong>Analysis</strong>: As Labor focused on opportunities for working people in the transition to renewables, the Greens mounted a formidable on-the-ground campaign", "body": "<p>Given the complex dynamics of the 2022 election campaign, many postmortems, from many points of view, will ultimately be undertaken.</p> <p>But one of the more intriguing questions to emerge after Saturday night is whether Labor fully understood the gathering momentum of the Greens voter recruitment exercise in metropolitan Brisbane once it was clear the Liberal vote in the inner city had collapsed.</p> <p>Labor certainly knew it was in a three-way contest with the Greens and the Liberals in Brisbane and in Ryan, and the campaign also knew the shadow frontbencher Terri Butler was in trouble in the inner-city seat of Griffith.</p> <p>The Labor campaign detected a tidal drift to the Greens in Brisbane during the closing fortnight of the campaign as undecided voters began to make their choices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/kristina-keneallys-loss-in-western-sydney-seat-a-predictable-result\">Independent who beat Kristina Keneally in western Sydney seat says Labor was \u2018arrogant\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labor did attempt to sandbag its position, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/labor-polling-suggests-brisbane-ryan-bennelong-and-higgins-are-winnable-due-to-pms-poor-standing\">deploying the Senate leader Penny Wong to Brisbane and Higgins</a> in Melbourne \u2013 two contests where there was a substantial progressive constituency but no teal candidate to harvest disaffected Liberal voters.</p> <p>But it was difficult to mount surgical corrective action, because Labor was also attempting to hold its traditional blue-collar territories in the outer suburbs of major cities, the Central Coast of New South Wales, and the Hunter Valley and the Northern Territory, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/the-red-wall-and-what-it-means-for-australias-election-campaign\">Scott Morrison was hunting on that side of the pendulum</a>.</p> <p>Unless the Liberal and Labor parties decide in the future to hold a secret meeting to carve up the electoral map, allocating metropolitan professionals to Labor, and the regions and outer suburbs to the Liberals and Nationals \u2013 the major parties are going to be stitching together constituencies that feel uncomfortable or discordant in times of polarisation and atomisation \u2013 and that was certainly Labor\u2019s approach in 2022.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So if Anthony Albanese engaged in any significant repositioning in the closing fortnight of the campaign in terms of the national climate policy messaging, that would risk Labor\u2019s electoral position in seats it needed to win.</p> <p>Now, it is absolutely possible that Labor significantly underestimated its own room to manoeuvre nationally because campaigns at some level are always fighting the last war.

It was set up in 2015 by the then home secretary, Theresa May, after decades of abuses by undercover police came to light. The proximate cause was that London\u2019s Metropolitan police force had spied on the Stephen Lawrence family campaign to discredit it. By then, the public was also aware that officers had deceived multiple women into long-term relationships to infiltrate political groups, and used dead children\u2019s identities. This was an espionage operation within Britain. The inquiry is looking at 139 officers spying on at least 1,000 mainly leftwing political groups since 1968.</p> <p>Ever since it was revealed that at least 20 officers formed intimate bonds with women as a means of winning activists\u2019 trust, a key question has been: who knew? A new book by five of the women, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/it-was-as-if-he-set-out-to-destroy-my-sanity-how-the-spy-cops-lied-their-way-into-womens-hearts-and-beds\" title=\"\">Deep Deception</a>, makes it painfully clear how much it matters to them to find out. Last year, the former Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/07/spy-cops-joked-about-sexual-relationships-with-women-inquiry-told\" title=\"\">Graham Coates gave an answer</a> in his evidence. He said \u201cmanagement knew what was going on\u201d and a \u201cblind eye\u201d was turned to sexual banter. Another former officer, Peter Francis, has said managers advised officers to \u201cuse condoms\u201d. But over the past fortnight, 13 former senior managers have told the inquiry that none of them knew what officers were doing. If they did not know, how did it happen?</p> <p>Secret work should be properly monitored and proportionately authorised. In one sense, the assertion of managerial ignorance could let institutions off the hook. But it also undermines the Met\u2019s claim to be a trustworthy and competent organisation. Based on the evidence so far, it is reasonable to conclude that where supervision is absent, abuses will occur.</p> <p>In years past, activists with suspicions about undercover policing were accused of paranoia. But fears turn out to have been justified. The public inquiry has disclosed that, in 1975, MI5 asked the police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/mi5-asked-police-to-spy-on-political-activities-of-children-inquiry-hears\" title=\"\">to spy on children</a> involved in \u201csubversive activity in schools\u201d. Groups spied on included School Kids Against the Nazis, while the Socialist Workers party was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/scale-of-police-spying-on-uk-leftist-party-was-orwellian-inquiry-hears\" title=\"\">under near-constant surveillance from 1970 to 2007</a>. These were soft targets. By contrast, a decision was taken not to deploy undercover officers in fascist groups because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/uk-police-took-high-level-decision-not-to-go-undercover-in-far-right-groups-in-1970s\" title=\"\">they were too violent</a>. (The SDS first sent an officer to infiltrate the far right in the 1980s.)</p> <p>The vast majority of police targets were non-violent, with the exception of some animal rights groups. While the choice of targets is perhaps not surprising, based on existing knowledge about police attitudes, the extent of the intrusion into people\u2019s private lives remains shocking. New evidence about the extent of police cooperation with MI5 makes it more so. </p> <p>Undercover officers are needed to counter terrorism and organised crime. But when things have been shown to go so wrong, there must be accountability. Despite past abuses, ministers refuse to set limits. Last year they chose to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/11/the-guardian-view-on-covert-human-intelligence-sources-draw-a-line\" title=\"\">override sensible amendments</a> to their covert human intelligence sources bill, which would have protected children, and restricted the kinds of crimes that undercover police can be involved in. This is all the more troubling given that it is unlikely spying on protest groups \u2013 and politicians \u2013 has stopped. In the police\u2019s view it seems yesterday\u2019s subversives are today\u2019s domestic extremists.</p> <p>Undercover officers\u2019 sexual relationships with activists were, the inquiry heard, \u201cendemic and common\u201d. With this phase of the inquiry focused on the period up to 1982, all the women tricked into relationships since are still waiting for disclosure. They fought for, and won, an apology. It is cruel to make them wait so long for an explanation.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the last two, City had needed results against West Ham and Brighton to finish above Liverpool.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66e23d6e10695f09f007ff25f9110e721dfc7bd4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66e23d6e10695f09f007ff25f9110e721dfc7bd4/0_224_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City fans invade the pitch after their side won the Premier League with a 3-2 victory against Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City fans invade the pitch after their side won the Premier League with a 3-2 victory against Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>City wobbled last Sunday in the 2-2 draw at West Ham, which kept Liverpool alive, and they did not just have to beat Villa, they had to master the pressure of the occasion. There had been a moment in January when they were 14 points clear of Liverpool, albeit having played two more games. Maybe that added to the jeopardy.</p> \n<p>The first half was an ordeal for City, the frustration intense. Fernandinho, the club captain who will now depart, would be given an emotional send-off at the end but he was exposed by Ollie Watkins before he was hooked at the interval.</p> \n<p>Guardiola fretted and so did the home crowd. Each missed pass from those in sky blue, every stalled move, drew howls. The manager wanted to play faster but it was not happening, City running into dead ends, their buildup lacking bite.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65be9868-c775-4759-b662-ae453641b0dd\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Villa wanted to manage the tempo, as Gerrard would have it; to waste time, as the City support would argue. Michael Oliver spoke to the Villa captain, Tyrone Mings, after the goalkeeper, Robin Olsen, took an age over a clearance. But Villa quickened the pace when they worked a move up the left and, when Lucas Digne crossed, Matty Cash got the run on Jo\u00e3o Cancelo to flash a header past Ederson.</p> \n<p>City offered little before the interval, save for a Phil Foden shot that went just wide. It was Villa who finished the half in the ascendancy. Watkins twice got away from Fernandinho only to be checked by him first time (no foul, surprisingly) and bailed out by John Stones on the second. Watkins also saw a shot blocked by Aymeric Laporte.</p> \n<p>Guardiola\u2019s half-time reshuffle saw Zinchenko come on at left-back, Cancelo swap flanks and Stones move into central defence. Zinchenko impressed and what a moment it was for him at the end when he wrapped a Ukrainian flag around the trophy for a poignant photo. He could not hold back the tears.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82bfdd4f790cb48d163340e7924208f9cb06490f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82bfdd4f790cb48d163340e7924208f9cb06490f/173_445_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ilkay G\u00fcndogan celebrates after scoring Manchester City\u2019s third goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ilkay G\u00fcndogan celebrates after scoring Manchester City\u2019s third goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>City flickered, Jesus going close, but they diced with disaster at the other end, Watkins running on to an Olsen clearance only to blow the one-on-one with Ederson.

Andreas Christensen is also heading for the exit, his move to Barcelona already agreed, while it remains to be seen if the Denmark international is joined at Camp Nou by Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd3c8f16166e6c25c00f6acbb20daa5975bb100e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd3c8f16166e6c25c00f6acbb20daa5975bb100e/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Gosling heads the ball past Chelsea\u2019s Edouard Mendy for Watford in their Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London on 22 May, 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Gosling heads past \u00c9douard Mendy to equalise for Watford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have to act as quickly as possible,\u201d said Tuchel, who also gave Chelsea\u2019s fans a chance to remember a couple of forgotten faces. There was a rare start in midfield for Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez, whose loan from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid has not worked out, and even more astonishingly there was an appearance for Kenedy, who had gone so long without playing in the league for Chelsea that Watford seemed utterly thrown by his presence at left wing-back.</p> <p>What an impact Kenedy made in Alonso\u2019s place during the early stages. The Brazilian was full of energy as he ran at Kiko Femen\u00eda and he soon left his mark on the game, his decisiveness impressive as he took a pass from Hakim Ziyech in the 11th minute and fired in a low cross for Kai Havertz to give Chelsea the lead from close range.</p> <p>The game already had the feel of a pre-season friendly. Even Tuchel was not his usual animated self on the touchline. The German remained impassive on the bench for much of the afternoon and it was not long before Chelsea began to toil, Havertz spurning chances and familiar failings threatening to offer Watford a route back into the contest.</p> <p>Watford, who were watched by their incoming manager Rob Edwards, belatedly stirred. Kiko tested \u00c9douard Mendy, who also had to be at his best to deny Jo\u00e3o Pedro at the start of the second half.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/leicestersouthampton-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester\u2019s Ayoze P\u00e9rez scores twice in stroll past deflated Southampton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chelsea, who brought Ben Chilwell off the bench for his first appearance since injuring a knee last November, were wobbling.

Relegation left him clearly dejected. \u201cSuffer,\u201d Jackson said of his immediate plans. \u201cThat won\u2019t go away for a long, long time. It will always be there. It is something I will have to live with. It won\u2019t go away.\u201d</p> <p>Nathan Collins set the tone, testing the hearts of the home fans early on by dribbling around his own box rather than clearing. The inevitable happened when he was dispossessed, allowing Newcastle to fashion a chance with Bruno Guimar\u00e3es on the edge of the box. His shot was palmed out by Nick Pope and Collins redeemed himself by whacking the ball behind for a corner.</p> <p>Collins had his head in his hands moments later after Pope pushed a Kieran Trippier corner to what he thought was safety but Collins raised his arm for reasons unknown. The ball struck it and the penalty was belatedly awarded after the referee, Craig Pawson, checked the pitchside monitor. Wilson sent Pope the wrong way.</p> <p>\u201cNathan has been brilliant,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHe\u2019s devastated but I am not going to criticise a young lad; he\u2019s done great for me. I am sure I will see him in the future going from strength to strength. It\u2019ll be a learning curve. There\u2019s no blame on him.\u201d</p> <p>There were nerves throughout the Burnley side, as the penalty proved. \u201cI think the pen has changed the mood of the group and around the ground,\u201d Jackson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38c4a24baa84c6abdcfe636643dc4393ea2f6db7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38c4a24baa84c6abdcfe636643dc4393ea2f6db7/0_0_3024_1815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Callum Wilson slots his first-half penalty past Nick Pope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Callum Wilson slots his first-half penalty past Nick Pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In defence Burnley looked uncharacteristically jittery and they lacked ideas in the final third, mainly hoping for a corner or long throw-in to get near the opposition net.</p> <p>Collins caused further concern for Burnley fans after the interval. A deep cross from Jacob Murphy looked simple for him to deal with but when trying to knock behind for a corner, he instead aimed for the bottom corner and only his poor connection allowed Pope to spare his blushes.</p> <p>Wilson had no problem finding the bottom corner on the hour. Allan Saint-Maximin dribbled into the box and passed into the unmarked striker\u2019s path, allowing Wilson to slot into a gaping net.</p> <p>Cornet provided hope after the makeshift right-back Collins pulled the ball back for the Ivorian. He needed two chances but, after Martin Dubravka saved his first shot, Cornet\u2019s follow-up volley kissed the net to allow Turf Moor to find its voice with the clock ticking.</p> <p>Everyone in claret and blue was fired up. The ball was repeatedly sent into the box for Wout Weghorst and Ashley Barnes to attack. Barnes drove a cross into the area but Weghorst\u2019s outstretched leg could only get the slightest of touches and the ball went wide from five yards.</p> <p>Crosses were flying in from all angles in search of a goal that never came, to leave Burnley with one certainty: they are relegated. A lack of squad depth has cost them: five players without a Premier League appearance this season were on the bench and others played out of position. Burnley go into the summer without a permanent manager and a number of key players out of contract.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere will have to be a reflection with what\u2019s gone on,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWith things like this you have to take small steps, find your way back and get yourself going again, and I am sure that\u2019s what the club will do.</p> <p>\u201cI am not really bothered about myself, I know how I feel and I am going to go suffer.

He returns to Chelsea an England international, his reputation enhanced by being the driving force of Vieira\u2019s team and he excelled again. Meanwhile, Bruno Fernandes\u2019s tricks and flicks were failing him, and he took out his frustrations on his teammates from the early stages, an outward display of the lack of team spirit that has been an open secret all season, that Ralf Rangnick, the outgoing interim manager, had confirmed before the game. Fernandes glowered at Anthony Elanga when the winger outpaced the Palace defence before squaring the ball beyond his sliding teammate.</p> <p>\u201cWe would have loved to take care of ourselves,\u201d said Rangnick. \u201cThe game was indicative of the last couple of weeks.\u201d</p> <p>United\u2019s fans sang throughout despite the deathly pallor of their team but they were quietened by Zaha barrelling into the inside-left channel, past Diogo Dalot and Victor Lindel\u00f6f, to score against his former club. As Zaha celebrated, Ten Hag, doubtless aware the TV cameras were on him, was stone-faced though at half-time was happy enough to pose for selfies with Palace fans. \u201cThis has been one of our problems,\u201d said Rangnick. \u201cThe way we defended, we are not aggressive enough, you need to make body contact.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sent out early for the second half by Rangnick, who powered down the touchline with the face of a man looking forward to all this being someone else\u2019s problem, United stepped up their efforts a tad.

Arsenal rained in 26 shots and should have finished with more than five goals, although if that total had been shared around a couple of their more fallow outings the streets of Islington might have been pulsating on Sunday night.

He emerged from the cold to score five goals in the final seven games but his contract expires in June: with guaranteed starts more likely elsewhere and Arsenal in the market for a centre-forward, there has been an impasse.</p> <p>\u201cYou know you have a player there who is going to help you and he\u2019s done that,\u201d Arteta said of Nketiah. The player gave nothing away during the post-match lap of honour, fixating more on his mobile phone, and body language experts may have had more joy with the meaningful waves offered by Alexandre Lacazette.</p> <p>Lacazette will soon be out of contract too, along with Mohamed Elneny, and Arteta said all three would know their destinies soon. \u201cI will speak to the three players now or tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that we need to start to move, but we have clear ideas of what we want to do.\u201d It is understood that Elneny, another player recalled late in the day but seemingly willing to act as cover, will sign a new deal.</p> <p>A purge of other squad players may follow. One candidate to be upgraded on, C\u00e9dric Soares, cast such uncertainties aside when wrapping his foot around Saka\u2019s quickly taken corner to score the third in the 56th minute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the hour Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, who can be sure of his importance, drilled through Asmir Begovic when Soares\u2019s deflected shot fell into his path.

It achieves that, the company says, by maintaining a large reserve of stable assets: while retail investors can buy or sell tether on cryptocurrency exchanges, institutional investors can also simply pay money directly to Tether to receive newly minted tokens, and can return the tokens to the company in exchange for cash.</p> <p>Initially, Tether claimed its reserves were backed one to one with US dollars. However, after an investigation by the New York attorney general, the company admitted that was not always the case and said that its currency was simply backed by \u201cTether\u2019s reserves\u201d. As part of that settlement, it agreed to publish a quarterly statement that detailed what those reserves comprise.</p> <p>The latest statement, dated before the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/12/stablecoin-tether-breaks-dollar-peg-cryptocurrencies\">crypto crash</a>, shows Tether storing about $20bn of its cash in commercial paper, $7bn in money market funds and nearly $40bn in US Treasury bills, all of which are generally stable investments. Another $7bn, however, is stored in \u201ccorporate bonds, funds and precious metals\u201d, and \u201cother investments (including digital tokens)\u201d. As a portion of Tether\u2019s reserves, it is comparably small, but it opens the company up to the risk of breaking its promise to be \u201cfully backed\u201d should a large market fluctuation occur.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian\u00a0business\u00a0email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That may already have happened, <a href=\"https://www.kalzumeus.com/2022/05/20/tether-required-recapitalization/\">said Patrick McKenzie</a>, a fintech commentator who works for the payments company Stripe. According to Tether\u2019s company accounts, it has $162m more in reserves than the total outstanding tokens it has issued, McKenzie noted. But, to list just one public investment from the company, some of the digital tokens Tether holds are those of crypto investment platform Celsius.</p> <p>\u201cTether has invested <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13gd4WIkDp7-AXA6vuBuL-GQIPBfQVCjPWxZz1dfjyHc/edit#gid=511202425\">$62.8m</a> of the reserves into Celsius network \u2026 Celsius is in freefall due to the current market dislocation; the value of their native token is down by over 86%,\u201d said McKenzie, adding: \u201cClearly, that investment has suffered more than $20m in impairment.

Surrey look down on the rest of Division One, <strong>Yorkshire</strong> unable to break through <strong>Warwickshire</strong>\u2019s<strong> </strong>defences at Headingley. </p> <p>Sam Hain and Will Rhodes both made centuries, batting undefeated all day in a partnership of 227 for the fourth wicket. Yorkshire had to settle for a fifth draw in six games. Joe Root hurt his thumb in the slips but soon returned to the field with the offending digit strapped up.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> took only 21 balls to winkle out the final wicket at Old Trafford and complete an innings victory, <strong>Lancashire</strong>\u2019s first home defeat since the 2018 Roses match. Forty-five spectators watched Luke Wood smash three boundaries before parrying Jamie Porter into the gloves of Adam Rossington.</p> <p><strong>Kent </strong>against <strong>Northamptonshire </strong>drifted to a draw after Northants avoided the follow-on, thanks to some biffing from Gareth Berg and 58 not out from Lewis McManus. Crawley zipped to his second half-century of the game, an innings of easy charm, and Ben Compton made an unbeaten 68 to go with the first-innings century. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice being picked for England,\u201d Crawley said. \u201cIt fills me with a lot of energy and maybe that\u2019s why I got a couple of runs this week.\u201d</p> <p>Haseeb Hameed danced to an unbeaten 93 off 96 balls, and Ben Slater 64, as <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> made light work of a potentially booby-trapped run-chase at Trent Bridge. Hameed hit the first ball of the day for four through midwicket and had the golden touch from that point on. It was <strong>Derbyshire</strong>\u2019s first defeat under their new coach, Mickey Arthur. </p> <p>But it is Middlesex who top Division Two after a 23-point six-wicket win at Lord\u2019s. <strong>Durham</strong> were dismissed for 188, despite a career-best 45 from the nightwatchman, Matt Salisbury, with Ben Stokes making a two-ball duck. Toby Roland-Jones took six for 35 and John Simpson nine catches in the match, a Lord\u2019s record. Despite a couple of scares Middlesex\u2019s batters then romped to victory.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-628a644d8f08d18babe1205a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-22T16:36:22.991Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And that\u2019s it from me </strong>Thanks for hanging around over the last seven rounds, it\u2019s been (to coin an upcoming competition) a blast.

Harmer, who has had an uncharacteristically spartan spring, taking six wickets at an average of just under 60 before this game, teased and poked at <strong>Lancashire</strong>, forced to follow on after a disastrous Friday evening had left them 24 for five.</p> <p>As Lancashire tried again, Harmer had Josh Bohannon and Steven Croft caught, before a partnership of 55 between Dane Vilas and Phil Salt gave them some breathing space. Salt then got a bottom edge to Matt Critchley and Vilas took a huge step forward to Harmer, but was hit on the back pad. The nightwatchman, Matt Parkinson, followed soon afterwards and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/essex\">Essex</a> took the extra half-hour.</p> <p>They nearly wrapped it up as Tom Bailey took a fancy to the new ball and hooked Sam Cook to where Paul Walter was waiting, and Hassan Ali followed with a dodgy slog sweep. Jimmy Anderson, who has eye-rolling experience of such situations with England, saw out the final overs with a 15-ball nought. Harmer walked off with five for 85. Earlier, Lancashire had been bowled out for 103 in their first innings. Salt top scored with a valiant 44, Sam Cook finished with four for 18.</p> <p>Keith Barker was the man of the moment at Taunton, first swiping 36, then running through <strong>Somerset</strong> as they toppled to a crushing defeat. With a first-innings lead of 69, <strong>Hampshire</strong> then bowled Somerset out for 69.

Toby Roland-Jones did the same to <strong>Durham</strong> at Lord\u2019s, removing Alex Lees, Michael Jones and Keegan Petersen. <strong>Middlesex </strong>had built a tidy first-innings lead of 72, with 84 from Sam Robson leading the way.

He\u2019d been admitted to hospital with a severe brain injury in October 2019 \u2013 in the old world, the pre-pandemic world when we could be with him day and night in hospital.</p> <p>Then lockdown happened. We naively believed that we would still be able to be with our son \u2013 he was vulnerable, brain damaged and, we were told, most likely to die. We drove to his hospital in London the following day but were told to leave immediately \u2013 the kind consultant could hardly bear to look at us as she gave us our instructions. She knew and we knew that we might not see our son alive again.</p> <p>For the next 14 months there were long periods of time when we were not allowed to be with him, as he was transferred from hospital to a care home \u2013 and then it was strictly for no more than two hours a day and in full PPE. They say that one\u2019s hearing is the last to go before we die, but touch is crucial when trying to bring someone back from the other side. As we could not be with him, our son could neither hear nor feel us as he lay entombed in his room, and we have no idea how much he suffered in his own physical and virtual lockdown.</p> <p>When we read about what was happening in No 10 during this period\u2013 the parties and \u201cbring your own booze\u201d \u2013 we felt anger for sure, initially, but then utterly bereft. We feel corrupted, tainted by the people running our government, for their cynicism, for their contempt. But our overpowering feeling is hopelessness. The suffering we endured personally \u2013 but also as a nation \u2013 meant nothing, really, to those in power. Bring on the next good headline \u2013 the prime minister lives to fight another day!

He had complications with a heart valve that had been fitted about seven years previously. The staff were amazing. In full PPE, they would hold an iPad so that we could try to communicate with him (he was put into an induced coma). They\u2019d speak on the phone telling us how he was doing. I knew he\u2019d gone before they did. One morning, he didn\u2019t move on screen, didn\u2019t respond to our voices. That night he had a heart attack and they contacted us to say he wouldn\u2019t make it. He was all alone. One person was allowed in when they turned off the machines.</p> <p>Grief is a strange and difficult beast; it brings up things you had long thought were dealt with and emotions you never knew existed. But the anger that I feel towards Boris Johnson and this cabinet is difficult to put into words. It makes me feel powerless and disgusted.</p> <p>They have no empathy and no understanding of what people have been through to protect loved ones, friends, neighbours, people we\u2019ve never met but know we could have harmed if we\u2019d broken the rules. They are an absolute disgrace and embarassment to this country.</p> <p>They have spent so long in their privileged bubbles that they feel invincible, and every time people in this country vote for them, they show them that they are. They will never apologise for their mistakes because they\u2019ve always done what they want and never been held to account.</p> <p>The only thing that makes it better is that I am not like them.

He was also an energetic teacher of English and drama at several state secondary schools.</p> <p>He was born Richard Edward Gratton in Thornley, Co Durham, the son of Dick (also Richard Edward), a coal miner, and Elizabeth (nee Hardman), later a Methodist preacher. Eddie\u2019s early performing experience came in local Methodist eisteddfods, where he won prizes in elocution. He attended AJ Dawson grammar school, Wingate, from 1950 to 1957. There, he played schools rugby at county level, and threw a snowball at Ann Smith, whom he married in 1961.</p> <p>Before their marriage, he undertook national service, during which, as well as playing rugby and cricket, he boxed for the RAF. He turned down a commission and trained as a teacher at Westminster College, Oxford. He and Ann, who also became a teacher, lived in Co Durham, mostly at Blackhall Rocks.</p> <p>An extremely popular all-round cricketer, Eddie played successively for Thornley, Castle Eden, Blackhall, Horden, Seaham and Mainsforth. At the highly ranked Blackhall, his enthusiasm and dedication in the late 1960s and 70s revived the club\u2019s membership and recruited a new generation of young players to senior cricket. He rarely travelled at weekends during the cricket season without his kit and made appearances for clubs as far south as Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>Eddie joined Hartlepool Operatic and Dramatic Association in the early 70s, making his directorial debut with Blithe Spirit in 1974. He later performed and/or directed with groups all over the north-east, including Opera Nova in Darlington and others in Stockton and Murton.</p> <p>As well as taking \u201cstraight\u201d roles \u2013 the press was assured that, unlike Keith Michell in the West End, he would not appear naked in Abelard and Heloise \u2013 he appeared in musicals, in which his bass baritone voice was powerfully united with his dramatic gifts, his most celebrated role being Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof.</p> <p>He taught and produced at Brierton comprehensive school, Hartlepool, spinning off the Brierton Players for former students who wanted to continue performing with him.</p> <p>Eddie retired from teaching in the 90s, objecting to Conservative government reforms which he thought concentrated too much on exams and removed much of the creativity from education.</p> <p>He was able to spend more time playing cricket and golf, singing on both sides of Tyne and Tees from the light operatic, musical or north-east dialect repertoires, and raising funds for charity through the Freemasons (in which capacity he was interviewed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/20/britishidentity.maevkennedy\">the Guardian</a><em> </em>in 2006). </p> <p>His activities continued almost until memory loss and a back injury forced him into hospital and then residential care in 2019; Ann also died that year.</p> <p>Eddie is survived by their children, Richard, Ruth, Rachel and Rebecca, and grandchildren Molly, Joe, Isabelle and Thomas, and by his sisters, Doreen and June.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "politics/2022/may/22/crispin-blunt-again-defends-convicted-sexual-abuser-imran-ahmad-khan", "type": "article", "sectionId": "politics", "sectionName": "Politics", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T16:18:13Z", "webTitle": "Crispin Blunt again defends convicted sexual abuser Imran Ahmad Khan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/22/crispin-blunt-again-defends-convicted-sexual-abuser-imran-ahmad-khan", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/may/22/crispin-blunt-again-defends-convicted-sexual-abuser-imran-ahmad-khan", "fields": {"headline": "Crispin Blunt again defends convicted sexual abuser Imran Ahmad Khan", "trailText": "Tory MP claims ex-colleague, found guilty of sexually assaulting 15-year-old boy, is victim of \u2018serious miscarriage of justice\u2019", "body": "<p>The Conservative MP Crispin Blunt has again defended his former colleague Imran Ahmad Khan, claiming Ahmad Khan\u2019s conviction for sexual abuse was \u201ca serious miscarriage of justice\u201d.</p> <p>Ahmad Khan was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/tory-mp-imran-ahmad-khan-guilty-sexually-assaulting-boy-15\">found guilty last month</a> of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008.

Janice Starlin, played by Susan Cabot, appears 20 years younger in a matter of days, but inevitably transforms into a monstrous creature \u2013 half-woman, half-wasp \u2013 who goes on to brutally murder and devour a string of unfortunate men. It mattered not that bees, rather than wasps, produce royal jelly. The Bee Woman? Nowhere near as terrifying.</p> <p>Unlike bees, which we adore for their honey and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/03/honeybees-fly-further-in-summer-to-find-food-study-shows\" title=\"\">waggle dances</a>, wasps have suffered from a poor public image for millennia. In the 4th century BC, Aristotle dismissed wasps as \u201cdevoid of the extraordinary features that characterise bees\u201d, adding conclusively, \u201cthey have nothing divine about them\u201d. Since then you\u2019d struggle to find a sympathetic cultural portrayal of wasps. Swarms of wasps smite unbelievers in the Bible. Shakespeare warns of waspish behaviour. We disparage the snobbishness of WASPs. <em>The Wasp Woman</em> epitomised the nightmarish (and somewhat sexist) association we have with the archetype. Wasps are narrow-waisted huntresses to be feared. Or at the very least, swatted away.</p> <p>Professor<a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/dr-seirian-sumner\" title=\"\"> Seirian Sumner</a>, a behavioural ecologist and entomologist at University College London, believes it is time to draw a line under this sorry history. She has spent the past 25 years studying and advocating for wasps. Aristotle, Shakespeare, <em>The Wasp Woman</em> \u2013 it\u2019s all part of a vast catalogue of anti-wasp media that she wearily describes in her book <em>Endless Forms: The Secret World of Wasps</em>.</p> <p>In it, Sumner argues that it is time we disentangle the wasp from the lazy tropes that have blighted its character for so long, and states the case for a renewed social, cultural and scientific appreciation for the creature. At last, perhaps, some good publicity for wasps.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Of all social insects, we have the most in common with wasps</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And if you were a wasp, Sumner is precisely the sort of person you would want as an ambassador. Her Twitter handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WaspWoman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@WaspWoman</a> is a statement that it is a persona she is proud to uphold. She is a different sort of wasp woman, one who hopes we will see wasps not as sting-wielding picnic pests or fodder for horror flicks, but instead for the many benefits they have quietly proffered upon the world for millions of years. Wasps can help us understand the evolution of social behaviours. They reveal secrets about the interconnectedness of life. And they represent vast, untapped, economic potential. \u201cThe problem with wasps,\u201d writes Sumner, \u201cis people.\u201d</p> <p>In March, I visited Sumner at her office in the UCL bioscience department. It is a small room with a prominent theme. In one corner stands a large flag for the rugby team Wasps. Her bookshelves are peppered with family photos and wasp-related souvenirs collected from research trips around the world. There is a large plastic \u201cdecorative wasp\u201d for gardens and a furry wasp soft toy (somewhat cuter). To my left, a collection of wasp nests are elegantly displayed, illustrating the delicate paper architecture of various species. Sumner shows me her favourite, the nest of a Belonogaster wasp from Zambia. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it looks like a designer dress?\u201d she says, handling the haute-couture construction with care. \u201cThere\u2019s a bodice and a puffball skirt. I want someone to make a dress like that.\u201d</p> <p>Sumner, 48, who has short brown hair and dark-framed glasses, didn\u2019t always feel this way about wasps. She too once feared their presence: \u201cI was the one to scream and run away, probably louder than anyone else, to be honest.\u201d In fact, she tells me, she was \u201ctricked\u201d into studying them. In 1996, she was pursuing a PhD in animal behaviour, perhaps on birds, she thought (she was into bird watching at the time), or meerkats, the much-loved socialites of the natural world. No such luck. She was recommended to <a href=\"https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Jeremy_Field\" title=\"\">Professor Jeremy Field</a>, a world expert in social wasps who was recruiting for a project in Southeast Asia. Sumner was excited about the adventure, but uneasy about the occupational hazards. Field was persuasive. \u201c\u2018Oh, these wasps don\u2019t sting,\u2019 he told me,\u201d says Sumner, \u201cwhich turned out to be a big fat lie!\u201d</p> <p>But it was in Malaysia, crouched in the jungle with a hover wasp nest dangling inches from her face, that Sumner\u2019s relationship with these insects transformed from \u201cignorance and fear, to respect, fascination and, you know, love for them, really\u201d. Thankfully it transpired that hover wasps only delivered a mild sting, so, for weeks, she watched as the insects navigated the complex framework of their existence, from birth to death. She realised her preconceptions about wasps were all wrong, their complexities overlooked. As she writes, wasps negotiate \u201cdivisions of labour, rebellions and policing, monarchies, leadership contests\u2026 \u201d It\u2019s like watching a miniature soap opera, she says. \u201cYou get really attached to them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1dd476ba5750b8c147273f96b890cc2748050fab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dd476ba5750b8c147273f96b890cc2748050fab/158_0_2134_2668/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sting in the tail \u2026 no summer picnic would be complete without a cheerfully buzzing black-and-yellow visitor.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sting in the tail: no summer picnic would be complete without a cheerfully buzzing black-and-yellow visitor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antagain/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of Sumner\u2019s research has focused on understanding what makes wasps tick \u2013 why helpers help, hunters hunt and why they choose to live in groups at all\u2026 The vespine<em> </em>raison d\u2019\u00eatre, if you will. As Sumner enjoys telling people, wasps existed 100m years before bees, and offer scientists such as herself the chance to travel back in time to unravel early stages in the evolution of sociality. A solitary hunting wasp gave rise to the social wasp (at some point in time, a wasp lost the ability to hunt and gained the ability to exploit pollen: the \u201coriginal bee\u201d). Boutique wasp societies, such as the hover wasp, which live in groups of around half a dozen, or the Polistes, which Sumner has studied in Panama for more than 15 years, offer an easy-to-manipulate testing ground for hypotheses about the emergence of social living.</p> <p>In Malaysia, Sumner hand-painted thousands of hover wasps in order to keep track of them. In Panama, she radio-tagged (just like microchipping a pet) similar numbers of Polistes to trace their movement further afield. Her studies trained a microscope on the behavioural traits of different wasp species. Some female hover wasps, for example, choose to stay in their nest and muck in with childcare, rather than depart to become a queen. The Polistes wasp \u201cdrifts\u201d from its own nest to assist others in the neighbourhood. Sumner tells me that one PhD student of hers, Robin Southon, observed that the odd male Polistes will even hang out at the nest and help feed the brood (albeit only briefly). \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a trade-off,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere they get to stay at home a bit longer, provided that they help out.\u201d It\u2019s impossible not to draw parallels with the negotiations we make in our own lives. As Sumner writes: \u201cOf all the social insects, it is these simple-societied wasps that we humans have most in common with.\u201d</p> <p>Observing the minutiae of wasp life is not without risks. In Panama, Sumner was stung badly and her face swelled up in a sort of \u201celephantine disfigurement\u201d. Before then she admits she was \u201cgung-ho\u201d about wearing a face covering. Now she always packs a wide-brimmed hat with netting. \u201cThe more you get stung, the more likely you are to have a very bad reaction,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I made a decision to be more careful. I don\u2019t want my career to be curtailed because I die getting stung by my favourite organism.\u201d</p> <p>Wasp researchers certainly have bravado. Sumner tells me about one student who got stung 189 times during a three-month field study. \u201cHe thanked the wasps for all the stings in his PhD thesis.\u201d When tackling vespids \u2013 such as a yellow jacket or hornet nest \u2013 researchers get decked out in full bee suits \u201c<em>Ghostbusters</em>-style\u201d. Otherwise, Sumner reassures me, it doesn\u2019t have to be anything fancy. \u201cA pair of Marigold gloves will do! Though you might want to gaffer tape up your sleeves and trouser legs\u2026 wasps like going into dark places.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Sumner\u2019s vivid enthusiasm </strong></em>for wasps is contagious. It sounds fun, gallivanting around the world with a pair of washing-up gloves, watching wasp <em>Big Brother</em>. And with every animated description of the daily lives of a wasp family, my prejudices melt away. But to Sumner, our cultural disinclination towards wasps is more than just a harmless misunderstanding, it is an obstruction to science. \u201cWe\u2019re primed from a young age not to like wasps and people can\u2019t help but carry that baggage into their research careers,\u201d she says. \u201cFor every paper on the ecosystem services of wasps, there are 40 about bees. Even the funding bodies, governments\u2026 they\u2019re also victims of our anti-wasp cultural upbringing. We\u2019re 100 years behind in our research compared to bees.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For every paper on the ecosystem services of wasps, there are 40 about bees</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If Sumner were to produce a film about wasp research \u2013 one that could outshine the hokey science of <em>The Wasp Woman</em> \u2013 it would be a period drama starring a pair of American entomologists named George and Elizabeth Peckham. During the early 1900s this charismatic husband-and-wife team made sport of chasing wasps around Wisconsin in their attempts to understand the hunting behaviour of the insect. Sumner pictures the pair leaping fences: Elizabeth in a hoop skirt, George in a shirt and necktie. \u201cI imagine Elizabeth shouting, you go chase the wasp George!\u201d says Sumner, adopting a Midwestern drawl. \u201cChase the wasp!\u201d The pair would follow wasps to the point of collapse, so eager were they to unlock its secrets. \u201cI was just blown away by how brilliant they were,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The Peckhams were one of a group of early naturalists who obsessively documented the lives of solitary wasps. The most prominent was Jean Henri Fabre, a French naturalist, known for placing wasps in bell jars with various prey and excitedly watching the action. Fabre described the wasp\u2019s sting in rather Freudian terms: \u201cMother\u2019s stiletto.\u201d Sumner describes the lives, passion and perceptiveness of these naturalists in a chapter of her book named The Obsessions of the Wasp Whisperers. Diving into these out-of-print texts, Sumner learned that a century ago scientists were tantalisingly close to understanding the behaviour of many wasps and that their conclusions were not so far off the truth.It is a reminder that a lot can be understood about the world around us, just by watching it. \u201cI considered naming the chapter Slow Wasping,\u201d she says. It sounds like a useful philosophy: to recognise that we can learn a lot from stopping to appreciate the creatures around us \u2013 even those we usually run from.</p> <p>For now, many questions about wasps remain unanswered, many wasps, unwatched. We know they contribute to pollination and help control the population of other insects, but what is their economic value? Sumner believes it is substantial, but without cold, hard data wasps will continue to be overlooked. Last year she co-authored a review of 500 academic papers to begin the process of quantifying the benefit of the insect. It found that wasps help pollinate 960 plant species, with 164 plants \u2013 mostly orchids \u2013 completely dependent on wasps. And they may contribute in lesser ways to the pollination of many other plants. Theirs is a role that should not be underestimated. Bee populations have dwindled due to human activity, but, as Sumner has written, some social wasps have proved remarkably resilient to anthropogenic change. The review concluded that wasps could prove to be a critical \u201cback-up pollinator\u201d in the face of changes to biodiversity.</p> <p>Sumner is interested in the role wasps play as a natural pest controller. Again, this is not a new idea, but deserves a closer look. In a 19th-century book named <em>British Social Wasps</em> (which sounds like a satire about high society, but is, in fact, quite literal), the physician Edward Latham Ormerod described how the eradication of wasps on a country estate soon led \u201clike Egypt\u201d to a plague of flies. Sumner cites this book as another example of scientists neglecting to follow up on observations about wasps made 150 years ago. If we are to harness wasps as pest controllers, we need to know more. In the UK, Sumner has been sequencing DNA from the guts of wasp larva (an elegant pastime if ever there was one), in order to understand what exactly wasps eat, and what pests they might best control. In Brazil, along with Southon, she has been releasing wasps into greenhouses to see how they affected the population of crop-damaging worms. Wasps may not be as efficient as pesticides, she explains, but the problem with pesticides is that they eradicate everything \u2013 \u201ceven wasps\u201d \u2013 regardless of the benefit. Wasps could be a free and sustainable alternative, a win-win for both farmers and ecosystems.</p> <p>Ultimately, what sort of relationship we want to have with wasps is up to us. How much we choose to gain, or believe that we lose, from their presence comes down to the narratives we spin. When we think of bees, we think fondly of a creature that is entwined in our lives. Bees are a crucial cog in the mechanics of global agriculture. They are indispensable to the future of humanity. Without them, we would crumble. \u201cWhat we need,\u201d says Sumner, \u201cis an equivalent story about wasps.\u201d</p> <p><em>Endless Forms: The Secret World of Wasps (William Collins, \u00a320) by Seirian Sumner will be published on 26 May.

The Dutchman, coolly triumphant in Miami and Emilia-Romagna, looks to have found his feet following a disastrous start to the season but his task today is a formidable one. </p> <p><strong>His </strong><strong>Mon\u00e9gasque</strong><strong> rival, 19 points ahead in the standings</strong>, blitzed round the circuit with an almighty lap yesterday to beat Verstappen to pole. The way he spun out on his first run \u2013 and the fact he has never done better than fourth at this circuit \u2013 will give his competitors cause for hope, though the fact Verstappen\u2019s car lost power in the final lap will bring unwelcome flashbacks of the early-season breakdowns that left him playing catch-up.</p> <p><strong>Both the drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championships</strong> are beginning to take the shape of a two-horse race, with Ferrari and Red Bull accelerating away from the chasing pack in the latter. Desperate to quash any league-of-their-own vibes are the Mercedes team, who have floundered thus far this season, finding no answer to the problem of porpoising caused by the new regulatory constraints.<br></p> <p><strong>Yesterday, though, offered hints</strong> that they may be readying themselves to show up to the party, George Russell and Lewis Hamilton putting in their best combined qualifying of the season. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely moved forward, which is great,\u201d ventured Hamilton after qualifying two places behind his teammate in sixth.<br></p> <p><strong>The week\u2019s other fun</strong> has come thanks to Aston Martin, whose upgraded car bears a design strikingly similar to Red Bull. The fact that two senior aerodynamicists left Red Bull for Aston Martin last year led Christian Horner to bemoan the suspicious emergence of \u201ca very close-looking clone\u201d, which has since been dubbed the \u201cgreen Red Bull\u201d and Horner\u2019s pit-wall team spent Friday\u2019s practice pointedly sipping on green cans of Red Bull in gloriously petty protest.

The car\u2019s bouncing has been dramatically reduced, now a problem only through the fast corners and they demonstrated better pace in Barcelona than at any of the previous five meetings. Russell vying brilliantly with Verstappen, and Hamilton coming through the field would have been unthinkable with the car that opened the season.</p> \n<p>Hamilton had endured a disastrous opening. Starting in sixth he was clipped by Kevin Magnussen at turn four on the opening lap. Hamilton pitted with a puncture and emerged in 19th. He felt he had damage and suggested retiring the car but was encouraged to race on by the team. Duly putting his head down, the seven-times world champion delivered some superb laps to take fourth near the end, only to have to ease off the pace because of a water leak, allowing Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz back past for the place.</p> \n<p>Wolff\u2019s reaction to his performance reflected how far the team felt they had come. \u201cWith Lewis we had probably the fastest race car today,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was at stages in the race the quickest and that shows the potential the car has. That looked like a world championship car he was driving.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Verstappen the win was also a turnaround that had seemed unthinkable for much of the race with Leclerc enjoying a dominant lead. Verstappen and Red Bull, however, stuck at their task and delivered an adaptive strategy to secure an impressive victory.</p> \n<p>It had not looked to be his day at all. Verstappen had taken to the gravel after an uncharacteristic error, prompted by high tail winds into turn four as he lost the rear, dropping him to fourth early on. Then a malfunctioning DRS unit meant Verstappen was unable to pass Russell with ease. Their wheel-to-wheel battle through turns one to three was as grand a scrap as we have seen this year; feisty but fair, it was a thriller.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With Russell defending so stoutly, Red Bull adapted their strategy, pitting Verstappen to attack on fresh tyres and he took to it with gusto.

His total losing streak, extending back to the period just before his injury when he was already trying to pull himself out of the mental burnout he suffered following his 2020 US Open triumph, stands at 11 defeats in successsion.</p> <p>The clearest issue for Thiem is his forehand, the focal point of his game and the stroke naturally most affected by the wrist injury. At times he snapped forehands well early in the point and at other times he set up short balls only to miss the easiest shot of the rally.</p> <p>His struggles were especially pronounced on the important points; he lost serve in the second set after he balked at a short ball, attempting a drop shot instead of crushing it and somehow lofting that drop shot high into the air and over the baseline.

By Serena Fokschaner", "body": "<p>When Alex Holloway first watched the Verve\u2019s music video for their 1997 Lucky Man single, he found his attention wandering from the guitar-strumming, Mod-mopped lead singer to the interior. The location was a quintessentially 90s industrial-style apartment designed by Richard Rogers. But it was not the floating staircase or steel-framed windows that piqued the future interior architect\u2019s imagination. It was the kitchen. The surfaces were made from that dimpled stainless steel you usually find in your local chippy. To the sci-fi-loving teenager Holloway, who also spent a lot of time \u201changing around fast food outlets\u201d, it was just the thing: futuristic, urban and cool.</p> <p>\u201cIt proved you can elevate the most basic material if you design it well,\u201d says Holloway, who co-founded his architecture and interiors practice, <a href=\"https://hollowayli.com/\" title=\"\">Holloway Li</a>, with architect Na Li in 2015. \u201cI decided that if I could ever afford my own flat, I\u2019d use it for my kitchen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c5a2418792886c1b1288a0544a0408649baca93b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5a2418792886c1b1288a0544a0408649baca93b/0_349_5976_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Designer in the house \u2026 Alex Holloway at his home in north London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Designer in the house: Alex Holloway at his home in north London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Forgham-Bailey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A chippy-inspired kitchen is not the only unusual thing about the north London apartment where Holloway lives with his partner, Elle Parmar Jenkins, an antiques dealer. After more than a decade of flat sharing, \u201cWhere you can\u2019t even hang a picture without annoying your house mates\u201d, he felt \u201cliberated to do things differently\u201d, in the property which he bought in 2019. Holloway, who began his career at the London practice Michaelis Boyd where he worked on projects for the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.sohohouse.com/en-us/\" title=\"\">Soho House group</a>, specialises in hotel and co-living projects. Like his mainly millennial audience, he favours \u201cHigh and low cultural references: a bit of street vernacular with good, classic design\u201d. The country-house aesthetic is not for him. \u201cFun, and a sense of adventure\u201d are. This home is his test bed for new materials and ideas.</p> <p>He was lucky that the Victorian building is not listed. So, with his amenable brother on hand to help, he went back to brick, jettisoning the partition walls of the formerly boxy layout. He made use of the hallway space, opening the small second bedroom so that it flows into the wide living and cooking area. The ceiling was removed \u2013 \u201creleasing two centuries of dust\u201d \u2013 and beams installed to echo the warmth of the wide floor planks. This is a corner property, so he added two new windows at either end. Now the top floor basks in \u201cmorning light, and sunsets\u2026 It has a nicely continental feel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9c6cdf93e49049b4b4fc3ddfa91f173a7554e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9c6cdf93e49049b4b4fc3ddfa91f173a7554e79/22_689_6287_3772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On tap: a bath in the study.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On tap: a bath in the study.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edmund Dabney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also likes the way the metal kitchen works with the sunlight, throwing \u201cbeams of light across the room like a disco ball\u201d. The carcasses are high-street with that textured metal surface \u2013 circle brush steel, to those in the trade \u2013 stuck on for designer effect. It sings against the fresco-pink plaster of the walls: \u201cYou can drill it and repatch it without having to redo the whole room. We like its lived-in texture and the way it complements the floor. It has a Quaker-ish simplicity.\u201d</p> <p>The dining table is another experiment. It is cut from a resin panel originally designed for a shop display. He used the versatile material \u2013 \u201cYou can dye it, carve it, it\u2019s a bit like wood\u201d \u2013 to make the shower-room panel and bedside table. A resin sculpture glows like a futuristic totem under the kitchen window.</p> <p>The zingy orange of the table \u2013 another Stanley Kubrick-esque reference \u2013 is picked up in a curvy fibreglass chair. It was designed by Holloway\u2019s studio and \u2013 in a nod to street architecture \u2013 is made by a Turkish company that also fits-out the interiors of London buses. Opposite, the sprawling 1970s corner sofa, complete with built-in shelf, comes from Parmar Jenkins\u2019s furniture shop, <a href=\"https://goodsin.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Goods In</a>, where she also restores vintage upholstery. Surplus stock often finds its way into the apartment. \u201cFriends say it looks like a showroom. Because it is. We experience new things before they\u2019re sold.

This is Holloway\u2019s \u201celevated version\u201d and it suits the fastidious side of his nature: \u201cI\u2019m rather obsessed with cleaning.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown, when most of the work took place, allowed extra time for mopping, and \u201cboredom bathing\u201d. There was not enough room in the bathroom for a tub. So, he tucked it under the window of the open-plan office, opposite the kitchen, threading the taps through the windowsill. \u201cDuring lockdown one of us would be in the bath while the other was at the desk.\u201d The tub-in-room is a boutique-hotel trope, but on-show ablutions are not for everyone. Holloway knows that, which is why he designed the space to be flexible. New owners can reinstate the wall if they want. \u201cBut for the moment I didn\u2019t want to be hamstrung by thoughts of future buyers. I wanted to enjoy the space, just as I encourage my clients to do.\u201d</p> <p>Some can be slow to embrace novelty. But Holloway hopes that when people see his laboratory of ideas, they will come round to his way of thinking. \u201cI believe that if you can justify something in terms of ergonomics, quality of design and usefulness, people will be more receptive to new ideas.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://hollowayli.com/\" title=\"\">hollowayli.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_hollowayli/\" title=\"\">@</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_hollowayli/?hl=en\">_hollowayli</a></em></p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "technology/2022/may/22/ukrainian-man-loses-life-savings-in-stablecoin-crypto-slump", "type": "article", "sectionId": "technology", "sectionName": "Technology", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T14:44:30Z", "webTitle": "Ukrainian man loses life savings in \u2018stablecoin\u2019 crypto slump ", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/22/ukrainian-man-loses-life-savings-in-stablecoin-crypto-slump", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/may/22/ukrainian-man-loses-life-savings-in-stablecoin-crypto-slump", "fields": {"headline": "Ukrainian man loses life savings in \u2018stablecoin\u2019 crypto slump ", "trailText": "Yuri Popovich invested in the supposedly safe cryptocurrency to protect against risks of the invasion", "body": "<p>A Ukrainian man who converted almost all his family\u2019s money into the crypto \u201cstablecoin\u201d terra in April in an effort to protect against the risks of invasion or currency collapse has lost almost $10,000 (\u00a38,000) after its sudden demise.</p> <p>\u201cIt was impossible and unsafe to store funds in the form of banknotes,\u201d said Yuri Popovich, who lives in Kyiv.

The first time I met him, seven years ago, H\u00f6ller introduced me to the pair of bullfinches he was hand-feeding while attempting to teach them to sing a forgotten 18th-century love song; he sent me away with a tube of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/17/carsten-holler-travel-down-a-slide-without-smiling-decision\" title=\"\">hallucinogenic toothpaste</a>, designed to enhance my dreams.

H\u00f6ller, an intense, never entirely earnest man of 60, often coolly dressed by his friend and sometime collaborator Miuccia Prada, tends to have his best ideas in the early morning. He lies in bed, he says, drinks a pot of warm coffee and lets his mind migrate. On one such half-awake dawn, he was musing on food as art. H\u00f6ller is a lover of brutalist architecture; he divides his time between his Stockholm apartment and a <a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/story/carsten-holler-marcel-odenbach-ghana-home\" title=\"\">concrete house</a> he had built near a beach 70 miles south of Accra in Ghana. What, he wondered, that morning, would brutalist food look and taste like? He jotted down a semi-jokey manifesto for \u201ca dogma kitchen\u201d.</p> <p>The first rule was that \u201cingredients are used alone \u2026 only water or salt may be added.\u201d Those single ingredients, his manifesto allowed, could be \u201coften divided and cooked in different ways and then added again to the same plate\u201d. Another fundamental of that 14-part declaration included the insistence that \u201cdecoration on the plate is avoided\u201d. \u201cWe are born brutalist eaters as mother\u2019s milk is essentially brutalist,\u201d he argued. And finally, \u201cBrutalist portions tend to be of substantial size.\u201d</p> <p>Before Covid-19, H\u00f6ller was half-thinking about doing a pop-up restaurant, based on his manifesto, with a celebrated Swedish chef, Stefan Eriksson. During the early part of the pandemic, with H\u00f6ller\u2019s exhibition plans across the world on hold, they decided to use the time to create not a pop-up but a proper brutalist restaurant. A couple of weeks ago, H\u00f6ller greeted me at the door of that early morning idea, which had opened for business two nights earlier. He had the look of a first-time father, knackered from sleepless nights, but full of anxious love for his new creation.</p> <p>We sat at a corner table in the 24-seat room that looks out through high windows on a street in Stockholm\u2019s old centre, near a cinema where Ingmar Bergman\u2019s films premiered. For a couple of hours while we talk, dishes \u2013 \u201ccleared,\u201d as H\u00f6ller says, \u201cof background noise\u201d \u2013 are placed before us. We begin with a plate of wild oysters \u2013 no lemon \u2013 from the west coast of Sweden and a raw, surprisingly sweet, baby turnip root; some charcuterie arrives along with airy crisps of roasted pork fat, and I\u2019m pretty much already a brutalist disciple.</p> <p>H\u00f6ller has enjoyed choosing restaurant suppliers with Eriksson; they are nearly all multigenerational family farmers, with an obsession for the singularity of certain products. The pork comes from a couple who have a smallholding \u201con a nature reserve in the middle of nowhere without a phone\u201d. The farm has a lake, and the pigs swim every day. H\u00f6ller believes you can taste those aquatic laps in the cured ham.</p> <p>What began as a whim has clearly become something of an overwhelming passion. \u201cI really got fed up with mayonnaise culture,\u201d he says. \u201cTraditional Swedish cooking is very nice but everything comes with some kind of creamy sauce. The aim here is to get rid of that. To dig down into the taste of a given ingredient.\u201d Thoughts tend to race through H\u00f6ller once they start. \u201cIt is the opposite of alchemy, you know,\u201d he goes on. \u201cMost chefs think they can create gold by combining lots of things to create something better. The principle here is that the gold is already there, you just have to trust in it.\u201d</p> <p>His point is made by a wonderful, clear asparagus broth, containing chunks of asparagus, some baked, some fermented, some raw. \u201cYou have asparagus, you don\u2019t need hollandaise,\u201d says H\u00f6ller. \u201cThis is a proper alchemist dish. They use just a little of the fermented asparagus, to turn the taste of the baked asparagus around on its axis.\u201d</p> <p>H\u00f6ller is German. He did much of his growing up in Belgium where his father worked for the EU. He is, as much of his work suggests, a lapsed scientist \u2013 he did a doctorate in biology, specialising in the ways aphids navigate the world. In his art career he has been more interested in human perception, experimenting with surprising ways to disrupt our ways of seeing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"62472765d9400d0b65deb0e612076ab7429b7d39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62472765d9400d0b65deb0e612076ab7429b7d39/0_594_3000_1990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dishes on a table at Carsten H\u00f6ller\u2019s restaurant Brutalisten in Stockholm, Sweden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Carsten and Tim both ate</strong> goat cheese, 155kr; champignon Carsten, 175kr; Norwegian diver scallops, 195kr; Sk\u00e5ne apples, 135kr; west coast Pacific and flat oysters, 65kr/pc and 85kr/pc; Sk\u00e5ne Linderoth and mangalitsa charcuterie, 120kr; Sk\u00e5ne rinds and lard, 65kr; Norwegian turbot, 245kr; Gotland white asparagus, 155kr. <strong>They both drank</strong> Bissap non-alcoholic wine, 75kr/37.5cl, beer 80kr, both created by Brutalisten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Schoenbaum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think it is nice to introduce a wrongness,\u201d he says. Everything in his restaurant, for example, is built slightly off square, either 85 or 95 degrees angles. There is a woozy spiral staircase based on these principles leading to an upstairs dining space. There will also be a lavatory, unfinished when I visited, at one end of the restaurant, with one-way glass, allowing the occupant to look out at the diners, but not (despite their fears) the other way around.</p> <p>The art mixes abstract minimalist pieces with a ceiling mural by a young American painter, Ana Benaroya, of \u201clots of naked women eating and dancing and smoking and kissing and everything good\u201d, as H\u00f6ller describes it. The principle of that clash of aesthetics is borrowed from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2008/nov/24/double-club-carsten-holler\" title=\"\">H\u00f6ller\u2019s Double Club in London</a>, which was located in an old Victorian warehouse for six months from November 2008. The bar and dance floor was divided precisely in half between western and Congolese spaces. That kind of juxtaposition fascinates him. He built his place in Ghana partly because he thought his beloved songbirds were on to something by living in two entirely different places through the year, the best of both worlds. \u201cIt is very nice to make your life into a double club,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I wonder if his brutalist feelings about food are rooted in his childhood. What did he eat as a kid?</p> <p>\u201cWhen she put her mind to it, my mother made strange things,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would often have veal brains, which I loved. Or she would do hare at Christmas. I have a clear memory of my first brutalist experience. I caught these tiny little shrimps that you have on the beach in Belgium and I carried them in a blue plastic bucket to the apartment we had rented. I cooked them in their own seawater and I ate them. I still remember the taste. Super-orthodox brutalist.\u201d</p> <p>That kind of memory of simplicity fuels his instincts against decoration. \u201cI don\u2019t want flowers on my food, ever,\u201d he says. \u201cIt disturbs me. It\u2019s the same as background music in restaurants, I don\u2019t want it. I want food that tastes like itself and I want the noise to be only the sound of friends talking.\u201d</p> <p>How will he deal with customers at Brutalisten who ask for mayo or ketchup? His plan, he says, \u201cis to just keep quietly saying that their food is on its way, until they look around and realise it never is\u201d.</p> <p>A bowl arrives containing what seems to be a large, single champignon mushroom, finely sliced in half and quarters. One part is grilled, one smoked, one raw and it sits in densely flavoured juices from a mushroom broth, reduced and distilled. Given H\u00f6ller\u2019s reputation as something of a mushroom shaman, was it an inevitable menu item?</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, a little wearily, \u201cI have made a lot of art that does not involve mushrooms or helter-skelters, but people tend to forget that.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside the restaurant he explains how he is currently working on <a href=\"https://arts.mit.edu/people/carsten-holler/\" title=\"\">a long-term sleep project</a> with some researchers at MIT. Part of it involves some prototype dream-stimulating pyjamas. He has plans to open a roadside motel in the US, where each identical room offers you a different kind of nocturnal vacation.</p> <p>He sees no real distinction between the two ventures, sensing a shared sensibility between artists and chefs. \u201cAt the beginning of the last century,\u201d he suggests, \u201cyou had all these art movements, surrealism and cubism and futurism, now I think some of that incredible avant garde is in cooking: you have molecular cuisine. All these theatrical experiences, Heston Blumenthal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/ferran-adria\" title=\"\">Ferran Adria</a> \u2026\u201d After we have eaten an ice-cream of goat milk with a crumble of whey on top and drunk a distinctively sour hop-free beer, H\u00f6ller then signs a brutalist menu for me.

Several ageing Gen X women (including Japanese Breakfast singer Michelle Zauner) discuss their love of the hairstyle, as well as their shared boyfriend, who sports one of his own from his beard. It\u2019s a pretty limp sketch to close out with, but it does feature three of the departing players (Mooney, McKinnon and Bryant).</p> <p>Despite a noticeable drop-off in the back half of the episode, this was a strong rebound from the dismal run the show has been on of late, with Lyonne proving a charming host. It also had a tangible sense of transition about it. Much as some of the departing members will be missed, the cast was in desperate need of some trimming this season, and hopefully this shake-up will give things a fresh feel come next season.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "education/2022/may/22/universities-union-abandons-national-approach-to-marking-dispute", "type": "article", "sectionId": "education", "sectionName": "Education", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T14:14:26Z", "webTitle": "UK universities union abandons national approach to marking dispute", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/22/universities-union-abandons-national-approach-to-marking-dispute", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/may/22/universities-union-abandons-national-approach-to-marking-dispute", "fields": {"headline": "UK universities union abandons national approach to marking dispute", "trailText": "UCU climbdown allows individual campuses to decide on strike action; 20 universities plan to go ahead", "body": "<p>The long-running industrial dispute over pension cuts and working conditions at UK universities appears to be faltering, after union branches abandoned a national marking strike due to start this week that could delay students from graduating.</p> <p>Last month, 41 branches of the University and College Union (UCU) backed a national marking and assessment boycott, supported by 86% of staff who returned ballots.

So, what did we learn along the way?</p> <h2>Lyon\u2019s domination</h2> <p>Talk of a power shift at the top of European women\u2019s football was emphatically put to bed with Lyon\u2019s stunning 3-1 defeat of the holders Barcelona in Turin on Saturday. However, it should not have been as surprising a result as much of the reaction suggested. Lyon had a bad season last year, finishing without a trophy for the first time since they won a first league title in the 2006-07 season, but that was a blip rather than the start of a decline. Lyon have achieved longevity through both financial and ideological investment in their women\u2019s football set-up for close to two decades. In that time, the club have driven player wages up, embedded a genuine \u201cone club\u201d mentality from top to bottom and created a culture that players want to be a part of. It will take time for a club to compete with that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/21/barcelona-lyon-womens-champions-league-match-report\">Ada Hegerberg inspires Lyon to Champions League win over Bar\u00e7a</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Group stage thrives</h2> <p>The introduction of a group stage this year has transformed the competition. Previously, clubs competed in a straight knockout that began with a round of 32, with some clubs entering directly and others taking part in qualifiers. For this season, after two rounds of qualifying, a 16-team group stage was introduced, with the holders and teams from the top three Uefa-ranked nations entering directly. The impact has been huge. Clubs are benefiting from more money and a new distribution model which means teams in the round of 16 have received \u20ac400,000 (teams that made the round of 32 earned \u20ac70,000 each in the preceding years). Beyond the finances, which also includes solidarity payments to clubs in leagues with teams represented in the tournament, has been the huge interest in the competition at an earlier stage. Previously, interest gathered pace once the tournament edged closer to the final, at the semi-final stage and occasionally the quarter-final stage. The games delivered, with top teams pitted against each other from a much earlier stage interest was high from the off and teams at the top of the game and lower down were able to test themselves over more fixtures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1d1aedfe212bb53c808ab7f9f27eeac1b2d006c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1d1aedfe212bb53c808ab7f9f27eeac1b2d006c/93_188_2768_1661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pernille Harder has helped Chelsea dominate domestically but Europe honours stayed out of reach.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pernille Harder has helped Chelsea dominate domestically but Europe honours stayed out of reach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Accessibility is key</h2> <p>Helping to catapult the popularity of the early stages of the competition has been the broadcast deal reached with Dazn. Previously, only rights to the final had been sold centrally by Uefa. The deal with Dazn has meant that this year and next all 61 games have been available to watch for free on Dazn\u2019s UWCL YouTube channel. For the 2023-24 season 19 will be free to watch on YouTube with the rest available to Dazn subscribers. The viewing figures released so far for this season have been hugely impressive. Over 14 million views from more than 210 countries watched the group stage games on YouTube, in addition to millions streaming on the Dazn platform. The willingness to sub-license rights to the final to ensure the game could be shown on TV too, on ITV in England for example, was important. The next big question is whether two years free before some games dip behind Dazn\u2019s paywall is enough to establish a hungry audience.</p> <h2>Catalans conquer</h2> <p>When the final whistle sounded in Turin you could be forgiven for thinking the result was the reverse as the Barcelona anthem echoed around the ground. Having twice sold out the Camp Nou and twice broken the club world-record attendance for a women\u2019s game in the process, Bar\u00e7a fans travelled to watch their defending champions in force. Lyon may be a powerhouse in the women\u2019s game, but the men\u2019s side is not one of the world\u2019s elite teams and the club do not have the global fanbase of teams such as Barcelona. As well as filling planes, 37 coaches travelled overnight from the Catalan capital. The work the club have done to pull their entire fanbase behind their women\u2019s football project in a committed fashion must be looked to by other clubs for inspiration. The biggest clubs wield huge power of influence over their fanbases, do more than make token efforts to present as \u201cone club\u201d and big things can be achieved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65e6d33d30c458ab286724a5d224a3bf2b7abece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65e6d33d30c458ab286724a5d224a3bf2b7abece/0_0_2915_510/1000.png\" alt=\"Women's football graphic Moving the Goalposts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"175\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our new women\u2019s football newsletter.\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our new women\u2019s football newsletter.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Chasing Lyon</h2> <p>The performance of teams from the Women\u2019s Super League in this year\u2019s competition was disappointing. Arsenal scraped out of their group on goal difference, having won three and lost three, including twice against Barcelona, before enduring defeat over two legs against Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals. Meanwhile Chelsea, runners-up last year, failed to escape the group of death, finishing level on points with both Wolfsburg and Juventus but with an inferior goal difference. Chelsea were outclassed in the final last year in a similar manner to the way in which Lyon outclassed Barcelona on Saturday night and in the 2019 final. What is clear is that those teams closest to bridging the gulf between Lyon and Barcelona and the rest are those most committed to going beyond PR stunts and to commit serious investment and support. Chelsea are arguably the team closest to providing that environment and commitment in England, followed closely by Arsenal and Manchester City. But, while Chelsea have players such as Sam Kerr and Pernille Harder on superstar wages, it is a minority of the team that benefit from bigger pay packets. At Lyon, high wages are the norm, as are vastly superior levels of investment. \u201cWe don\u2019t just want to fight for titles but also to make women\u2019s football an absolutely essential and super positive part of the success of the whole club,\u201d the Lyon owner and president, Jean-Michel Aulas, told the Guardian in 2020. \u201cWe pay better than others, because for us economic respect is an important part of our values.\u201d Until clubs start to embody a similar ethos at the top, they will struggle to compete.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "lifeandstyle/2022/may/22/phones-are-like-a-scab-we-know-we-shouldnt-pick-the-truth-about-social-media-and-anxiety", "type": "article", "sectionId": "lifeandstyle", "sectionName": "Life and style", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T14:00:02Z", "webTitle": "\u2018Phones are like a scab we know we shouldn\u2019t pick\u2019: the truth about social media and anxiety", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/22/phones-are-like-a-scab-we-know-we-shouldnt-pick-the-truth-about-social-media-and-anxiety", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/22/phones-are-like-a-scab-we-know-we-shouldnt-pick-the-truth-about-social-media-and-anxiety", "fields": {"headline": "\u2018Phones are like a scab we know we shouldn\u2019t pick\u2019: the truth about social media and anxiety", "trailText": "Although connecting with friends online has positive benefits for mental health, overdoing screen time can lead to a catastrophic emotional crash", "body": "<p>Most people think that phones are a bad thing for anxiety. Parents, in particular, believe phones are terrible for the mental health of children, teenagers and young adults. So, what is the truth? While I was writing my book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/you-dont-understand-me-9781788705127\" title=\"\">You Don\u2019t Understand Me</a>, which addresses the mental health of teenage girls and young women, I felt I had to get to the bottom of the relationship between phones and anxiety. And to be honest, it doesn\u2019t look great. Since smartphones came out in around 2000, there has been a steady decline in the mental health of young people. But as we know, correlation does not necessarily equal causation.</p> <p>What I have observed clinically is that rather than being the cause of the problem per se, phones seem to act as a catalyst to our emotions. This can be a positive thing, when it allows us to connect with friends and family; share happy news; photos or jokes. It also allows marginalised communities to find each other.</p> <p>However, humans are wired to foresee danger and our minds can quickly spiral from an initial trigger to create catastrophic, wholly imaginary circumstances, which our bodies respond to as though they are true. In your head this goes something like: \u201cSome of my friends are meeting without me &gt; they don\u2019t want me there &gt; they don\u2019t really like me &gt; nobody really likes me &gt; I am fundamentally unlovable and will die alone.\u201d</p> <p>The phone contributes to this in a number of different ways. First it allows us to know our friends are meeting without us. There was something in \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d and now there is no ignorance. We know, and we get to sit on our sofa in some old jogging bottoms on a Saturday night and compare our inside worries, our worst sides, our ugliest self, with endless, perfectly curated versions of other people\u2019s lives. And guess what? That makes us anxious and unhappy.</p> <p>Our phone is like a scab we know we shouldn\u2019t pick. We know it is making us feel bad seeing our rich friend on a weekend trip away with her gorgeous partner; we know we should put our phone down and go and do something constructive and positive \u2013 some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/yoga\" title=\"\">yoga</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/walking\" title=\"\">walk</a>, a hot bath with candles. Look, there is someone on Instagram with a perfect bathroom and a beautiful body showing us what we should be doing, and we are just sitting around scrolling \u2013 no wonder no one wants to hang out with you. In this way, your phone can trigger a second round of self-judgment about how lazy or worthless you are.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The phone intensifies a comparison culture that can leave you feeling not good enough in every single aspect of life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The phone intensifies a comparison culture that can leave you feeling not good enough in every single aspect of life: not thin enough; not successful enough; not tidy or organised enough; not living in a nice enough home; not well-read or smart enough.</p> <p>And while research into the effects of this on mental health is in its infancy, there is particularly <a href=\"https://researchnow.flinders.edu.au/en/persons/marika-tiggemann-2\" title=\"\">damning research</a> in relation to viewing photos of perfect bodies, which is shown to increase body dissatisfaction, with a link to eating disorders. Even when we know the images are doctored, and even when they are shown in relation to fitness, they still impact on body dissatisfaction.</p> <p>So some of the questions I ask my patients about their phone use are:</p> <p><strong>Are you using your phone to connect to people</strong><strong> or to compare to people?</strong> The former is positive for mental health but the latter will likely increase anxiety.</p> <p><strong>Is there a tipping point where phone use changes from positive to negative? Do you notice this tipping point? And can you put your phone away then?</strong> My experience suggests it is just at this point that the phone is at its most magnetic.</p> <p><strong>Is your phone </strong><strong>getting in the way of you doing things which are positive for mental health?</strong> Phone use is perhaps at its most damaging when it gets in the way of sleeping, eating regularly, being outside and moving your body, all of which are important for wellbeing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Research suggests there may be a sweet spot with mobile phone use, after which the screen stops being helpful and starts having a negative impact</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Research suggests that there may be a sweet spot with mobile phone use, after which the screen stops being helpful or fun and starts having a negative impact on wellbeing. An analogy to drinking is helpful: a couple of glasses of red wine can be relaxing; a bottle a night is not so helpful. And like with drinking, some people find it difficult to stop just at the point when they should.</p> <p>So if you are experiencing anxiety, think about your phone use \u2013 think about how much time you spend on it and on what kind of content. Readdressing this might be one important key in unlocking a less anxious life.</p> <p>Phone and internet use is best when it is in line with our other values rather than taking us away from them. There is often a wafer-thin line between these two, but I would look for phone use which is driven by:</p> <p><strong>Connecting to people.</strong> A shared family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp\" title=\"\">WhatsApp</a> group or FaceTiming old friends can be great. But this is not the same as seeking out ex-schoolmates to see how successful they are \u2013 that is comparison.</p> <p><strong>Compassion</strong><strong> for yourself.</strong> An online yoga class, meditation app or an audiobook at bedtime are examples of nourishing ways to use the internet. Watching back-to-back episodes of a box set into the night is not compassionate; it is getting in the way of the self-care of sleeping.</p> <p><strong>Creativ</strong><strong>ity.</strong> The phone has allowed a democratisation of creativity, particularly in photography, but also in sharing humour, craft, art and writing. Teenagers in particular have demonstrated incredible creativity on platforms such as TikTok but we need to have caution for content that is reductive rather than expansive, especially in relation to beauty or sexuality.</p> <p><strong>Curiousity about difference.</strong> Phones can turn a mild disagreement into a massive row, with positions becoming entrenched.

Asked why cases were mostly in that group, she said: \u201cThat\u2019s because of the frequent close contacts they may have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe would recommend to anyone who\u2019s having changes in sex partners regularly, or having close contact with individuals that they don\u2019t know, to come forward if they develop a rash\u201d she added.</p> <p>Monkeypox is not a highly infectious disease and most cases in rural Africa are believed to arise when people come into contact with infected animals. But the disease can spread from person to person through close contact with ulcers and blisters, which often appear around the mouth and genitals; respiratory droplets; and contaminated materials such as bedding, towels and cooking utensils.</p> <p>The incubation period can be as long as 21 days, meaning symptoms can take three weeks to appear after exposure to the virus, but in the latest outbreak, many patients are developing a rash within days. Patients can develop a fever before other symptoms come on.</p> <p>To help contain the spread of the virus, high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, including some healthcare workers, have been given shots of a smallpox vaccine, Imvanex, which can protect against monkeypox.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re using it in individuals who we believe are at high risk of developing symptoms and using it early, particularly within four or five days of the case developing symptoms,\u201d Hopkins said.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "business/2022/may/22/uk-high-fuel-bills-eon-boss-michael-lewis-says", "type": "article", "sectionId": "business", "sectionName": "Business", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T13:17:29Z", "webTitle": "UK should expect high fuel bills for at least 18 months, E.ON boss says", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/uk-high-fuel-bills-eon-boss-michael-lewis-says", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/22/uk-high-fuel-bills-eon-boss-michael-lewis-says", "fields": {"headline": "UK should expect high fuel bills for at least 18 months, E.ON boss says", "trailText": "Michael Lewis calls for substanstial government intervention to help people deal with costs", "body": "<p>Consumers will have to cope with extraordinarily high fuel bills for at least another 18 months, the boss of Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier has said.</p> <p>Michael Lewis, the chief executive of E.ON UK, called for \u201cvery substantial\u201d government intervention to help people with escalating fuel bills, one of the biggest factors in the cost-of-living crisis.</p> <p>Bills could reach \u00a33,000 when the price cap lifts in October, he said, when people would also need more gas and electricity to heat their homes.</p> <p>Lewis said E.ON expected almost one in five customers to struggle to pay their bills in the autumn, when price rises were \u201cbaked in\u201d.

This is where money disappears from view.\u201d</p> <p>Knowles, a professor of sociology at Goldsmiths University, is interested in money, in wealth, how it is spent and how, as she puts it, it got \u201cencrusted in the landscape of London\u201d. That\u2019s essentially the subject of her new book, <em>Serious Money</em>. Its subtitle is <em>Walking Plutocratic London</em>, and that\u2019s exactly what she does in its pages, striding from Shoreditch and the City, through to St James\u2019s, Mayfair, up to Regent\u2019s Park, back down to Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Kensington, Notting Hill, Chelsea and out west to Richmond and finally Virginia Water.</p> <p>What she means by the trail running cold is that in this gated community wealth retreats behind high walls and large view-blocking electric gates, taking up residence in the vast impenetrable mansions that are standard hereabouts.

To me they are a bit like Beverly Hills without the sidewalks or celebrities. Back in its hip period in the 1970s, residents of the estate included Elton John, a couple of Bee Gees and Diana Dors. But since Bruce Forsyth moved on to that great quiz show in the sky, the most notable figures, aside from several golfers, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/oct/18/pinochet.chile\">General Pinochet</a>, the Chilean dictator who was held there under luxurious house arrest for 18 months at the turn of the century, and the former Tubeway Army frontman Gary Numan.</p> <p>If the fame of the occupants is no longer electric, their wealth still packs a charge. Houses around here go for up to \u00a350m. This is what\u2019s known as \u201csuper prime\u201d property \u2013 homes costing more than \u00a310m. In 2020, despite coronavirus and the Brexit deadline, \u00a31.3bn was spent on super prime property in the first eight months of the year, a rise of 16% on the previous year, although the number of sales was roughly the same.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s largely new money,\u201d says Knowles about Wentworth\u2019s super primes, \u201cor people who want to remain hidden.\u201d</p> <p>Taking her inspiration from the pyschogeographic meanderings of the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/iain-sinclair\">Iain Sinclair</a> and the intellectual perambulations of the German critical theorist Walter Benjamin, Knowles set out to explore the \u201cplutocratification\u201d of the capital on foot, observing the ways in which the super-rich have stamped their tastes, lifestyles and all-round expensive mark on a large swathe of the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3385c589c2105c92e48c3ad2c36e254f1c9c583\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3385c589c2105c92e48c3ad2c36e254f1c9c583/427_0_4403_4405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Balenciaga department store stall with high heeled boots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Money is highly conspicuous in Mayfair\u2019s shops, but the real action goes on in the less visible private equity firms around Berkeley Square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She walks everywhere, making observations as she goes, and meeting a number of rich or super-rich people along the way, all of whom are granted anonymity under the veil of nicknames such as \u201cBanker\u201d, \u201cBlazer\u201d, \u201cLady\u201d and so on.</p> <p>It\u2019s not easy to access the seriously wealthy, and Knowles has to rely on the trust and goodwill of contacts of contacts, and sometimes contacts of contacts of contacts. She repays them with a faithful rendition of their views, sometimes tinged with little comments sharp enough to make you wince. When one Notting Hill resident tells her she likes the \u201csocial mix\u201d of the neighbourhood, Knowles asks what that means, and hears a roll-call of professions: judges, economists, filmmakers and so on, leading her to observe acidly that the role of the poor is \u201clending authenticity to what would otherwise be a sterile plutocratic bubble\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many rich people feel anxious about poverty in London\u2026 They don\u2019t want to trip over beggars outside the opera house</p> <footer> <cite>Caroline Knowles</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But I can see how her interviewees might have let their guard down. Knowles is a disarming figure, thoughtful, self-effacing, but alive to the many ways that money puts a distance between the haves and have-nots. She is also keenly aware of the tensions that exist between the rich and the super-rich, or as she calls them, the haves and have-yachts, the so-called ultra high-net-worths with more than \u00a320m in assets \u2013 excluding their main residence.</p> <p>A few days before we go to Virginia Water, I meet Knowles at the Wolseley restaurant in Piccadilly, a celebrated hangout of the rich and famous, which sits between the clubland of St James\u2019s to the south and the playboy heritage of Mayfair to the north. She tucks into a sustaining breakfast while we prepare for our own pounding of the plutocratic streets.</p> <p>It\u2019s abundantly evident that, with the Ritz hotel next door and the Royal Academy just across the road, we\u2019re in an elite part of town. But wasn\u2019t it ever thus? It\u2019s not like London was ever some unvarying egalitarian utopia or dystopia, depending on your view of these things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13f70dfb88194cceca1f28dd5952657a4d26c0d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13f70dfb88194cceca1f28dd5952657a4d26c0d6/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Knowles in Mayfair\u2019s Berkeley Square.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Knowles in Mayfair\u2019s Berkeley Square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agrees, \u201cLondon has always been a machine for extracting money from capital and piling it up. All cities are about that to some extent. But it\u2019s also a modern phenomenon, because the wealthy bits of London have progressively expanded into different areas. Richmond was always a bourgeois kind of landscape, but now it\u2019s been taken over by superwealth.\u201d The average price of a detached house in Richmond is now almost \u00a33.5m.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been something going on since the 90s which has drawn people from other countries to London,\u201d says Knowles, who notes that 49% of property sales in central London in 2020 were to overseas buyers. According to <em>Forbes</em> magazine, London now has the fourth most billionaires of any city in the world. It has consequently developed what Knowles calls \u201ca whole ecosystem\u201d for dealing with wealth: hedge funds, private equity firms, and what are known as family offices \u2013 a one-stop shop, as it were, for wealth management, with everything from daily expenses to investments being overseen by a dedicated team. Much of this ecosystem is based just north of the Wolseley, in and around Mayfair, which boasts the highest density of private equity firms in the world.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Some of the people who have found London an alluring location are, of course, the Russian oligarchs who\u2019ve recently been subject to sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. According to Transparency International, Russian businesspeople and officials accused of corruption or links to the Kremlin own at least 150 properties in the UK worth \u00a31.5bn \u2013 mostly in London. However, Knowles is quick to note that most rich Russians in London are not oligarchs. She speaks to several in her book who say that they earned their money in finance or IT.</p> <p>\u201cI found Russians actually very ready to speak,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Russian billionaires I talked to were very open about their wealth, although they\u2019ve often reinvented themselves as philanthropists and patrons of the arts.\u201d Many, she says, are in London to get as far away from Putin as they can.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Capacious rooms have ceilings so high a giraffe could walk through them without having to bend its neck</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Outside we head up to Mayfair, which alongside the hedge funds and private equity firms, is said to contain 28% of London\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurants.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s an odd place, because in one sense the money is highly conspicuous \u2013 there are the famous hotels, Claridges, the Connaught, the Dorchester, with their chauffeur-driven clientele \u2013 the art galleries and the luxury-car showrooms that never seem to have any customers.</p> <p>But the real action goes on in the offices around Berkeley Square, hidden away behind the facades of Georgian town houses. Not bound by large banks, private equity firms, writes Knowles, are \u201cdriven by the relentless expansion of money, whatever the consequences\u201d. It could be asset-stripping or investment in unsavoury regimes; the key thing is rate of return on investment. Two years ago the value of UK listed companies bought by private equity was \u00a34bn. Last year it was \u00a329.3bn.</p> <p>Outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Charles Street, she wryly observes the site of a protest against the imprisonment and sentence of 800 lashes handed out to the Palestinian poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/02/palestinian-poet-ashraf-fayadhs-death-sentence-overturned-by-saudi-court\">Ashraf Fayadh</a> in 2016. \u201cJust as in London you are supposedly never more than 6ft away from a rat,\u201d she writes in the book, \u201cin Mayfair you are rarely far from a serious human rights violation.\u201d</p> <p>We move on down through St James\u2019s to the Nash-designed splendour of Carlton House Terrace. At one end is the British Academy, of which Knowles is a member. We pay a quick visit around its capacious rooms with ceilings so high a giraffe could walk through them without having to bend its neck. The staircase alone is a wonder to behold, the kind of sight that transports you back to an <em>Upstairs Downstairs</em> era of balls and servants. A few doors along are three houses belonging to the the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/oct/16/pressandpublishing2\">Hinduja brothers</a>, the multibillionaire industrialists.

Ten million gets you the right to stay for ever after two years.</p> <p>It was Mandelson, of course, who famously said that he was \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes\u201d. The filthy rich, however, are extremely adept at tax avoidance. One character Knowles meets, who made his fortune in private equity and lives in a six-storey Mayfair house with 7,000sq ft of space, argues that people like himself should pay more tax, and that tax breaks should only be given to those investments that \u201ccontribute to collective wealth creation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI found a lot of rich people feel anxious about the levels of poverty in London,\u201d she says, adding acerbically: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to trip over beggars on leaving the opera house.\u201d</p> <p>We walk through Pall Mall\u2019s clubland, with its austere buildings filled with hushed libraries and comfortable chairs to doze in, and on to Belgravia, the land of embassies, and once there to Eaton Square, which has been called Red Square, owing to the number of Russian billionaires who have homes here. They included Roman Abramovich, Oleg Deripaska and Andrey Goncharenko. The first two have been sanctioned, but Goncharenko, CEO of a Gazprom subsidiary, who also owns the \u00a3120m Hanover Lodge in Regent\u2019s Park, has not had his property impounded. Leasehold apartments in Eaton Square range from \u00a32-\u00a310m.</p> <p>The square forms the centrepiece of the Grosvenor Estate, a large area of prime real estate owned by the Duke of Westminster. They may be on long leases, but all the wealthy occupants of houses and apartments around here are tenants of the 31-year-old duke, who is estimated to be worth more than \u00a310bn, and was at one time said to be the richest person in the world under 30. This is where new money meets the very old \u2013 the oligarchy and the landed gentry.</p> <p>\u201cHave you noticed how every house has magnolias in their window box?\u201d asks Knowles.</p> <p>She\u2019s right, they do. It\u2019s a feature of the Grosvenor Estate, apparently, some kind of floral requirement. It\u2019s one of the decorative touches that help normalise a strange legacy of the distant past. It\u2019s now politically acceptable to feel a sense of outrage at Russians or billionaires from other nations, who took advantage of a corrupt state to gain their wealth. But of aristocrats whose forebears did something similar with land, only hundreds of years ago, we\u2019re still in social awe.</p> <p>The duke turned down Knowles\u2019s request to be interviewed. Instead she got his estate manager. Again and again while writing the book, she discovered that you can\u2019t penetrate the world of the rich. You have to be invited in, and it\u2019s invariably on their terms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are areas of the capital that those from lower down the social ladder can only enter as servants or labourers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In any case, she\u2019s less interested in very wealthy people as individuals than as representatives of the \u201cmechanisms of plutocratic consolidation\u201d, which is the material armoury that accompanies wealth \u2013 second (or third) properties, multiple luxury cars, domestic staff, private schools, private club membership, upwards to yachts and even private jet and private protection teams.</p> <p>We walk on through Knightsbridge, along Hyde Park, via Kensington Palace Gardens \u2013 said to be the most expensive street in London \u2013 to Kensington, scene of the so-called \u201cbasement wars\u201d that Knowles documents in her book. These are the conflicts that occur when the super wealthy move into an area and start digging downwards, sometimes two or three floors or even, in some cases, deeper.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sign of money, and the need for ever more space in an already cramped city, but it\u2019s also frequently seen as an anti-communal development, an act that is an assault on the peace and quiet of neighbours. One celebrated case involved the singer Robbie Williams, who wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/19/robbie-williams-wins-pool-planning-victory-over-jimmy-page\">build a swimming pool in his basement</a>, and his next-door neighbour, the Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who sought to stop excavation work for fear that it would damage his Grade I listed Tower House.</p> <p>That got very bitter, but at least it was confined to the rock music fraternity and people of a similar wealth. More often the complaints are made by the \u201chaves\u201d and aimed at the \u201chave-yachts\u201d.<strong> </strong>The result has been a strengthening of community environmental groups, born of nimbyism, perhaps, but devoted to maintaining the \u201ccharacter\u201d of an area by slowing the depredations of the super-rich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59c67e63c2ffffaa31968cc7b00bbef7bfea29fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59c67e63c2ffffaa31968cc7b00bbef7bfea29fa/0_170_5120_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eaton Square\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eaton Square \u2013 also known as \u2018Red Square\u2019, owing to the number of Russian billionaires who bought property there.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Norris Travel Photography/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One weird aspect of all this is that the digging machines that are used to scoop out the basement spaces, Knowles writes, are often left buried amid the foundations. \u201cHiring a crane and blocking off the street to recover a \u00a35,000 or \u00a36,000 digger is not cost-effective in a multimillion-pound renovation.\u201d</p> <p>It makes you wonder what archaeologists of the post-apocalyptic future will make of these mysterious artefacts when they are eventually reclaimed from their resting place. If all other signs of Kensington\u2019s glory were to disintegrate into radioactive dust, will they be able to work out the finely stratified nature of the civilisation that produced these subterranean machines?</p> <p>From the stuccoed streets north of Kensington High Street we walk north to Holland Park, home \u2013 among other locations \u2013 to David Beckham and Sir Richard Branson, then on to Notting Hill. In her book, Knowles interviews several Notting Hill wives involved in a charity to support Grenfell Tower survivors.</p> <p>It\u2019s a painful disjunction between the beautiful avenues with their elegant houses and communal gardens and the burnt tower block in which 72 people lost their lives. And it makes for some of Knowles\u2019s most uneasy conversations.</p> <p>\u201cI think they were a group of women who looked for meaningful ways of spending their time,\u201d she says. \u201cI think what they were searching for was some kind of authenticity.\u201d</p> <p>The reader is left in doubt as to whether they ever truly find it, but then that\u2019s in the nature of their predicament. To cross the class and economic divides that mark, or scar, London is not a journey many are able to make successfully. At least in Notting Hill there is still a sense of the cheek-by-jowl poles of wealth and poverty that have long distinguished London from other European cities, in which the poor are often safely kept away from the rich.</p> <p>But perhaps the overriding impression left by my walk with Knowles and by her book is that the most advanced form of gentrification \u2013 plutocratification \u2013 is creating whole areas of the capital that those from lower down the social ladder can now only enter as servants or labourers.</p> <p>\u201cA city,\u201d she writes in conclusion, \u201cwithout reciprocity, collective life and neighbourhood interaction, in which everything is bought and paid for, is a bleak prospect \u2013 and an unsustainable one.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s the answer, I ask.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to press ahead with redistributing some of the enormous wealth that sits in London, and which sits in Mediterranean harbours in yachts, not even being used by the rich themselves,\u201d she says, and then concludes with her own question, of the kind that never quite receives a proper answer: \u201cWhy is all that dead money not being used to make things happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Serious Money by Caroline Knowles is published by Allen Lane (\u00a325)</em>.

The truth, I suspect, lies somewhere in between. <strong>Johannes07051833</strong></p> <p>Einstein famously said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. By that measure, we don\u2019t learn from the lessons of history because we are insane. As for what those lessons are, one that has to be high up there is attributing quotes to Einstein with no evidence. <strong>BellaTheCook</strong></p> <p>A prime example is trickledown economics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/20/joe-biden-trickle-down-economics-build-up\">which has failed in three separate centuries</a> from the 19th onwards but which Rishi Sunak is still determined to revive in a different guise. Another is reducing corporation tax in the hope that companies will invest in jobs. The US tried this and mostly what happened was that directors\u2019 pay went even higher and the companies spent their tax reduction on buying back their shares. Another good example is the idea that increasing penalties reduces crime. Germany found the better solution was to detect and catch more criminals. <strong>diogenesfan</strong></p> <p>Ah yes, but I think you are making a mistake there, on whether or not the people proposing trickledown economics really thought it would work, or had any interest in it doing so. <strong>Paulo777</strong></p> <p>Punishing the poor won\u2019t make them rich. <strong>yahbut</strong></p> <p>Never get involved in a land war in Asia. <strong>Sagarmatha1953</strong></p> <p>I think that the most important lesson history has taught us is that a competent leader is an essential figure for a population. <strong>Sofia Battafarano</strong></p> <p>Never go back for your handbag. <strong>Gryphone</strong></p> <p>Don\u2019t follow leaders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/13/bob-dylan-subterranean-homesick-blues-50th-anniversary\">watch the parking meters</a>. <strong>SimonKennedy</strong></p> <p>Lots of ways to make money damage the planet. Lots of us do learn but the moneymakers and shareholders don\u2019t because they think their money is more important. Unfortunately for all of us, they will learn in the end. <strong>Nora Boswell</strong></p> <p>There are a lot of lessons that are inarguable. The US economy rollercoastered through crash after crash until banking was regulated in the Great Depression, and then when those regulations were removed under Reagan it went back to being a rollercoaster ride. It\u2019s not really a mystery. I know the Republicans try to ignore that, but it\u2019s not so much based on a different perspective on history as it is: \u201cDon\u2019t look over there!\u201d <strong>Thomas1178</strong></p> <p>If there is a lesson to be learned from history, rather than our own personal experiences of it, it\u2019s that there seems to be no limit to the callous cruelty, sadism and selfishness that people will allow themselves to exhibit, once they are in a position to do so, and nobody stops them. <strong>Aireman</strong></p> <p>Every generation thinks the problems they face are unique, and don\u2019t imagine for one minute that any human or society has ever faced the same dilemma. As such, any possible lessons from the past are discarded, or not even considered, with the \u201cthat was then, this is now\u201d attitude. The solution is there, it\u2019s been used before, just see if the past can provide the answers. <strong>Lycurgianite</strong></p> <p>Generally, this is something you say when you lost the argument last time around. So now you want the next generation to make the same case again on your behalf, ideally with a heavy dose of \u201cI told you so\u201d. <strong>MickeyFynn</strong></p> <p>History is a single unrepeatable process from which we can learn nothing. <strong>John Owens</strong></p> <p>Learning is both an intellectual and emotional process. It is the emotional learning that often has the bigger part in behaviour change. We may learn intellectual lessons from history books but not emotional lessons. <strong>Maxtoby</strong></p> <p>The study of history involves at least two differing viewpoints: the view of the present, when we read and observe what happened in the past; and the view of the past itself, what they said, did, felt, experienced in that time. The closest, best analogy I can think of is it is akin to a parallax: \u201cThe effect by which the position or direction of an object appears to change when the object is seen from different positions\u201d (OED entry for parallax). Therefore, there are very few absolute lessons of history. (One absolute lesson \u2013 which we have learned and are still learning \u2013 is that human rights are universal and non-negotiable.) There is much to learn from history, for both our present and our past. But what those lessons are? For most things, it is too early to tell. <strong>ChrisLoughlin</strong></p> <p>It was only when I went to the European Hansemuseum in L\u00fcbeck, Germany, that I realised the trading system they had constructed some 700 years ago was highly sophisticated; I then found myself amazed that people then could have such complex ideas, and then found myself wondering why on earth I would think that these people were somehow stupider than myself. I then realised that humans are condemned to make the same mistakes in perpetuity because we are outrageously arrogant. Hubris and complacency are our downfall. <strong>roidespines</strong></p> <p>There is no such thing as the \u201clessons of history\u201d. At best, it is a comparison between what we believe happened, according to the imperfect way that history is recorded, and what we believe might have happened had different decisions been made. In other words, no real value at all. <strong>AlGlagow</strong></p> <p>\u201cScience enables humans to satisfy their needs. It does nothing to change them. They are no different today from what they have always been. There is progress in knowledge, but not in ethics. This is the verdict both of science and history, and the view of every one of the world\u2019s religions.\u201d (John Gray, Straw Dogs). <strong>Violator</strong></p> <p>Because the very rich and powerful promote the idea that \u201chistory is bunk\u201d so that they can carry on as before. <strong>ThePunkOpaque</strong></p> <p>We do learn the lessons of history; that\u2019s why society in general is richer, healthier, more peaceful and longer-living than hundreds of years ago or even decades ago. People might say that is largely to do with science and technology, but those are two of the most important tools we have developed to help us learn and solve the lessons and problems of history. <strong>Shortordercook</strong></p> <p>My observation is that history and religion are alike in that people pick out the parts that support what they wish to believe and ignore anything contradictory. The social media today, et al, supports this exponentially. <strong>Wilson McIvor, Virginia</strong></p> <p>The practice of drawing lessons from history is fraught with difficulty; things change, making direct comparison challenging. Given the breadth and depth of history, which exists as a body of interpretive practice rather than fact-collation, apparent lessons will also differ from author to author. This has a direct bearing on why \u201clessons\u201d are not learned; quite often, the key thing to take away from an event is of the continuing marginalisation of minorities or those outside power, to maintain a particular social order. As, until relatively recently, history was overwhelmingly written by people who benefited from that marginalisation, readers of their texts were unlikely to learn the lesson of how power works, because their history was intended to obscure those functions and render their social position \u201cnatural\u201d. TLDR: history is about power and power likes to aggregate power to itself. <strong>Mitch Goodrum, Oxford</strong></p> <p>We can\u2019t get a grip on history,<br>it stalks too close behind.<br>We live and learn<br>then die and forget<br>and thus it slips our mind.<br><strong>Bernard Towers, Norfolk</strong></p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "business/2022/may/22/first-woman-wins-fisherman-of-the-year-award", "type": "article", "sectionId": "business", "sectionName": "Business", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T12:41:15Z", "webTitle": "\u2018A huge achievement\u2019: first woman wins UK\u2019s Fisherman of the Year", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/first-woman-wins-fisherman-of-the-year-award", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/22/first-woman-wins-fisherman-of-the-year-award", "fields": {"headline": "\u2018A huge achievement\u2019: first woman wins UK\u2019s Fisherman of the Year", "trailText": "Ashley Mullenger talks about the difficulties of finding the right boots and lifejackets, and getting more women into the industry", "body": "<p>Being a woman in the male-dominated fishing industry has presented some challenges for Ashley Mullenger, who has become the first woman to win a Fisherman of the Year award.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s little things like the ankle cut on the boots we wear \u2013 for men it\u2019s wider and you need to have good ankle support on a boat when you\u2019re working on a moving deck.

The first opera by a female composer to be performed at the festival, it has a difficult history and a somewhat ambiguous reputation. Begun in 1902 to a French libretto by Smyth\u2019s sometime lover Henry Brewster, it was first performed in Leipzig, in German, in 1906, in a much cut version that Smyth loathed, before being heard in London in 1909 with the libretto in an English translation by Smyth herself, considered so problematic that posthumous attempts have been made to rewrite it. An urtext edition by Martyn Bennett going back to the original French version is given here.</p> <p>Though The Wreckers has long been a rarity, huge claims have been made for it as the most significant English opera between Purcell\u2019s death (1695) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/16/britten-where-to-start-with-his-music\">Britten</a>\u2019s Peter Grimes (1945), a work that The Wreckers is widely thought to anticipate.

A booming labour market represents the silver lining to the dark cloud hanging over the economy. There are more job vacancies than there are people officially classified as out of work and firms are paying signing-on bonuses to attract staff. What\u2019s more, as Boris Johnson said repeatedly at prime minister\u2019s questions last week, an unemployment rate of 3.7% is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/17/uk-pay-inflation-unemployment-city-bonuses\">lowest since 1974</a>.</p> <p>No question, the labour market is in better shape now than ministers expected even six months ago. Back then there was concern that the end of the Treasury\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/covid-support-schemes-left-open-goal-to-fraudsters-says-watchdog\">furlough scheme</a> would lead to large numbers of firms going bust and a significant increase in unemployment.</p> <p>So nervous was the Bank of England at the impact of the end of wage subsidies on unemployment that it delayed pushing up interest rates. Threadneedle Street has recently taken some stick for failing to act more quickly, but it was a reasonable call to make. A wait-and-see approach made sense.</p> <p>There are, though, two problems with the idea that Britain has returned to the balmy days of postwar full employment. The first is that the jobless total is expected to rise as a combination of falling living standards, higher taxes and rising interest rates push the economy into recession. The Bank has been wrongfooted in the past by the continued strength of the labour market, and it could be guilty of excess pessimism this time too. That said, its assumption that three years of nugatory growth will result in the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2022/may-2022\">jobless rate rising to 5.5%</a> by 2025 could easily come to pass.</p> <p>The other problem is that the full employment narrative only holds true for the better-off parts of the country. As a study by researchers from Sheffield Hallam University shows, for the bits of Britain most in need of \u201clevelling up\u201d, full employment is a myth.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://shura.shu.ac.uk/30252/\">report</a> seeks to come up with a figure for the real level of unemployment in Britain and is the sixth in a series that has been published every five years since 1997. By adding in the hidden unemployed \u2013 people who are on incapacity benefits but who would be working in a truly full employment economy \u2013 the researchers come up with an unemployment total of 2.34 million \u2013 a million higher than the government\u2019s preferred yardstick for joblessness. These are not fraudulent claims and they account for slightly less than a third of the headline total of incapacity claimants of working age.</p> <p>Hidden unemployment has come down from just over a million in 1997. Some reduction was to be expected because in the 1980s and 1990s workers who lost their jobs in manufacturing or in mining were \u201cparked\u201d on incapacity benefits in order to massage the unemployment figures.</p> <p>But that generation of workers has now retired and the fact there are still almost 800,000 hidden unemployed means the original cohort of redundant industrial workers on incapacity benefits has been replaced by the generation that followed them.</p> <p>A geographical breakdown of hidden unemployment shows it is highest in areas affected by the deindustrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s. Wales has more hidden unemployed (83,000) than jobless benefit claimants (67,400). In Scotland, adding in the hidden unemployed results in a real unemployment level of 224,000 compared with the official claimant total of 122,300. There is a similar pattern in the north-west and the north-east of England.</p> <p>The report divides the country into three distinct parts: \u201cfull employment Britain\u201d, where 20 million people live and the real level of unemployment is below 4%, and 14% of joblessness is hidden; \u201cmiddling Britain\u201d, where 31 million live and the real level of unemployment is between 4% and 8%, and 34% of the total is hidden; and \u201chigh unemployment Britain\u201d, where 14 million live and real unemployment is above 8%, and 42% of the total is hidden.</p> <p>There are pockets of \u201cfull employment Britain\u201d outside the south-east. York and the Ribble Valley feature in the list of the 20 districts with the lowest estimated real unemployment. Richmondshire, where the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is the MP, had the lowest real unemployment of all at 1.5%. \u201cHigh unemployment Britain\u201d is dominated by the old industrial heartlands and seaside towns. Blackpool (14.7%) has the highest real unemployment level in Britain, followed by Blaenau Gwent (12.2%) and Knowsley (11.8%).</p> <p>Prof Steve Fothergill, one of the report\u2019s authors, said: \u201cWhile unemployment is clearly down on levels during the pandemic and down on the levels of the 1980s and early 90s, the Treasury, the Bank of England and economic commentators should not fool themselves into believing Britain has reached anything like full employment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian\u00a0business\u00a0email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In theory, people living in high unemployment areas should move to areas where there are more jobs available, but in reality this doesn\u2019t happen. The economic consultants Miraj Mistry and Paul Ormerod looked at more than 300 local authorities to see whether the gap between high and low unemployment areas narrowed over time. They found that it did, but at a glacial pace.</p> <p>Clearly there is not going to be much levelling up if the economy goes into a tailspin, because those areas with the weakest labour markets are likely to be hit hardest. But growing the economy would not be enough to narrow the gap between full employment and high unemployment Britain. Nor is it simply a question of spending billions of pounds on infrastructure projects.</p> <p>What\u2019s needed is a combination of the macro (regional aid, public investment, state aid, procurement) and micro (tailored support to re-engage those on incapacity benefits with the world of work). As Fothergill says, there has been little sign so far of the additional funding and action on a scale commensurate with the enormous challenge.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "film/2022/may/22/the-end-of-western-civilisation-triangle-of-sadness-director-explains-modelling-world-satire", "type": "article", "sectionId": "film", "sectionName": "Film", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T12:26:43Z", "webTitle": "\u2018The end of western civilisation\u2019: Triangle of Sadness director explains modelling world satire", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/22/the-end-of-western-civilisation-triangle-of-sadness-director-explains-modelling-world-satire", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/22/the-end-of-western-civilisation-triangle-of-sadness-director-explains-modelling-world-satire", "fields": {"headline": "\u2018The end of western civilisation\u2019: Triangle of Sadness director explains modelling world satire", "trailText": "Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s shipwreck comedy draws blood from a social scene strikingly similar to that at Cannes. \u2018We urban Europeans are not a good audience,\u2019 the director has told audiences at the film festival", "body": "<p>The shrieks of delight and horror greeting Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s latest film, Triangle of Sadness, are a mark of success for its award-winning Swedish director, he said on Sunday, following the film\u2019s Cannes festival premiere. \u00d6stlund explained he intended to make a \u201crollercoaster experience\u201d for adults.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were applauding like it was a football game,\u201d said \u00d6stlund.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/21/the-triangle-of-sadness-review-heavy-handed-satire-on-the-super-rich-loses-its-shape\">The Triangle of Sadness review \u2013 heavy-handed satire on the super-rich loses its shape</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u00d6stlund, best known for his 2014 alpine drama Force Majeure, which was remade in English two years ago as Downhill, may also have ably succeeded in establishing the status of his young British star, Harris Dickinson, with this new film. Dickinson, 25, from Leytonstone, east London, carries much of the narrative of a film which also features copious amounts of vomit and diarrhea \u2013 and yet has earned the longest audience ovation of the festival so far (eight minutes).</p> <p>In the role of a male model, Carl, who is in a relationship with a supermodel influencer, Dickinson said he had to allow himself to be treated as a \u201cpiece of meat\u201d in the drama, but joked he would have happily accepted the role of the donkey, an animal who comes to a sticky end in the film, so keen was he to work on the project.</p> <p>With a title that refers to the unwelcome frown zone on a model\u2019s forehead, Triangle of Sadness is a vicious satirical attack on the warped but perhaps inevitable social power of beauty and wealth. \u00d6stlund described the film\u2019s original pitch as for a story that \u201cstarts the fashion world, goes on to a luxury yacht and ends on island, and where we are going to see how the models use their looks as currency throughout.

Not for watching in a smart way.\u201d</p> <p>The director added that he had aimed to create a blend of the European cinema tradition, \u201cof trying to say something about society\u201d, with the productive American habit of making films that are driven by the need to please audiences and make money.</p> <p>Some critics have hailed it as one of the best films of the festival so far.</p> <p>\u00d6stlund\u2019s cast of actors, including Woody Harrelson, as a drunken Marxist yacht captain, were all asked to improvise and to regularly endure 25 takes for each shot.</p> <p>Harrelson, 60, in Cannes for the premiere, said that he did not identify closely with the role he played because while the character is a Marxist, he is an anarchist. He then ventured his own risky joke, inspired by President George W Bush\u2019s recent gaffe about the Russian invasion of Ukraine: \u201cI am the kind of guy who thinks it is abominable when a country, a country with all this military, a superpower, attacks just unprovoked a county like Ira...Afgha...Vietna...No, sorry lost my way there.\u201d</p> <p>But the American star raved about working with \u00d6stlund on the film.</p> <p>\u201cHe can make you extremely uncomfortable and make you think. He makes you laugh throughout, perhaps more importantly, which is quite a trick. I am going to be in his next film whether he wants me or not. It was a revitalising experience, one of the greatest experiences of my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u00d6stlund said he had chosen to examine the fashion industry because of conversations with his wife, a fashion photographer, and his interest in the way fashion commercialises the human instinct to find security in the look of the herd.</p> <p>Dickinson said he felt his character in the film played a knowing part in this economy: \u201cHe very much knows where he stands and he uses his looks to his advantage. Ruben makes incredibly astute observations about human behaviour and picks holes in all our egos. I had to allow myself to be pathetic and offer myself up as a piece of meat.

Is it because I write in an Italian that\u2019s false, spurious, slanted, nonexistent?\u201d) She vents frustration on translation being seen as \u201cimitative as opposed to imaginative\u201d, and is persuasive on the difficulty of translating your own work: \u201cThere are no rules to obey when the only authority is oneself.\u201d These self-appraisals are more interesting than the rather technical essays on other writers (three of which are on her friend Domenico Starnone\u2019s novels).</p> <p>Lahiri writes in Italian to \u201cfeel free\u201d but also values how it makes her slow down \u2013 \u201cI knocked on this door quite late, and it creaks a little\u201d \u2013 and think differently, like a modernist painter who restricts herself to two colours to learn how it makes her see. A new language, she writes, is a form of blindness, but \u201cI believe I\u2019m blind even in English, only in reverse. Familiarity, dexterity and ease with a language can confer another form of blindness.\u201d</p> <p>That is not the only blind spot in a book that shows too little of the \u201cmyself\u201d in the title. The hole that runs throughout is the answer to why Lahiri moved to Italy, and to Italian, in the first place. She didn\u2019t answer it in <em>In Other Words</em> and she doesn\u2019t here. Is it simply that, as Leopardi put it, \u201cno language has enough words and phrases to correspond to and express all the infinite subtleties of thought\u201d?</p> <p>No. To return to Winterson on Eliot: \u201cIt is clear that [his] stylistic development, from <em>The Waste Land</em> to <em>Four Quartets</em>, is an emotional development of a profound order.\u201d It is equally clear that Lahiri\u2019s is too. But we get only hints of this momentous change: she had \u201crun away\u201d to Italy, \u201ctaking refuge in the Italian language in search of freedom and happiness\u201d. One piece is written \u201cduring a particularly challenging year of my life\u201d. Why provoke curiosity you won\u2019t satisfy? Without seeing the input that led to the output, we feel as she does in her essay on Gramsci\u2019s prison letters: \u201cWe experience only a single strand of a double thread.\u201d</p> <p>There is, however, a switch right at the end, in an afterword where Lahiri returns to the book best suited to any writer in the business of transformation: the <em>Metamorphoses</em><em>.</em> \u201cOvid\u2019s great poem, for me, is the sun.\u201d She recounts the story of her mother\u2019s decline in health, and death, in 2021, when Lahiri derives consolation from Ovid\u2019s lines. \u201cMy soul stirs to speak of forms changed into new bodies.\u201d Suddenly, when it is almost too late, this cool, detached book bristles with life and love.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Translating Myself and Others</em> by Jhumpa Lahiri is published by Princeton University Press (\u00a316.99).

Keen to outrun his boyband past, he donned an oversized acoustic guitar and transported himself to the 1970s. It topped the charts but faded quickly. Unsurprisingly, then, this third album favours the sound of 2019\u2019s multi-platinum, Grammy-winning follow-up, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/15/harry-styles-fine-line-review\">Fine Line</a> </em>\u2013 all warm 80s grooves, clipped yacht rock and lyrics that touch on sex, drugs and expensive wine.</p> <p>Across its 13 tracks, not a single moment is wasted, be it flab-free lead single As It Was, or the soft-pop flex of the excellent Late Night Talking.

Even the rustic, listens-to-Fleet Foxes-once Boyfriends feels light-footed.</p> <p>As with both his preceding albums, however, <em>Harry\u2019s House</em> is occasionally hobbled by its lyrics.

These are minor quibbles, because ultimately Styles is more concerned with mood than minutiae.

She doesn\u2019t get why my partner and I would want to have sex with other people; why, God why, would we want to question a structure as sacred and, let\u2019s face it, successful as monogamy? As she said, when I first mentioned I\u2019d been on a date with someone who wasn\u2019t my long-term partner, \u201cWell, what if he finds someone better than you?\u201d Brutal. Mothers really know how to find your deepest insecurity before wringing it \u2013 and you \u2013 out like a dishcloth.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t wrong, though. What if he does find someone better than me? That was, admittedly, the first question I had when my partner and I decided to sleep with other people a year ago. Not only that, we decided it would be fine if we went on dates with other people, too: one, two, 10 \u2013 as long as we kept, as every pop psychologist whose bestseller I\u2019ve never read will tell you, communication streams open.</p> <p>The first date with someone else was mine. It was with an incredibly hot guy who I\u2019d met at a fashion party, because I\u2019m glamorous like that. He flirted so hard it was essentially impossible to say no. My partner and I discussed it: \u201cLet\u2019s just see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Naturally I was nervous. The guy was hot. I was sweaty. It was the first date I\u2019d been on in way over half a decade. What on earth do you talk about? I messaged a friend who is a very chic dater: \u201cJust ask him his most problematic opinion\u2026 Honestly, it\u2019s the best opener.\u201d I wore black, because I always wear black, and I unbuttoned my shirt one lower than usual. I kissed my partner and my dog, Celine Dion, goodbye. And off I went.</p> <p>The date was fun, the sex was wild \u2013 not better or worse, but invigorating in its difference. Kissing was, bizarrely, harder than anything else because a kiss with a stranger these days feels more intimate, and until then that intimacy had been reserved only for my partner.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The rush of the new spills over into my primary partnership</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I arrived home that night after sleeping with the first person who wasn\u2019t my boyfriend in seven years, I felt, simply, glad to climb into bed next to him. But also, perhaps, like I was beginning to undo three decades of conditioning towards monogamy. A monogamy which, until then, I\u2019d held on to so tightly it was as likely to suffocate me, or my partner, as the worrisome potential of finding someone better.</p> <p>See, the thing about our monogamous relationship was that the desire we had for others never went away. It was simply annexed in our brain, right there next to Catholicism and the bad exes. That\u2019s not to say it was repressed. I don\u2019t know a single person in a monogamous relationship who doesn\u2019t flirt, have crushes, perhaps overstep the mark in someone\u2019s DMs. A lot of people cheat, too. It\u2019s been this way for aeons and it will be this way for aeons to come (or until the next pesky mass extinction event hits). And annexing this desire is perfectly fine, but when you simply ask the question, \u201cBut why?\u201d, finding a solid answer becomes difficult.</p> <p>The day after I\u2019d consummated our open relationship, we packed a bag and drove to the countryside for a friend\u2019s baby\u2019s christening. The atmosphere in the car as we drove out of London was one of deep, icy tension. We could not seem to find the right song to narrate the moment, for the whole 90-minute trip, until I burst and said: \u201cOK, we fucked!\u201d</p> <p>We decided there and then, on the A419 on the way to celebrate the choices of some dear friends who had done what they were supposed to do and moved to the countryside to raise their perfect child, that this open thing was a terrible idea.</p> <p>My partner is the love of my life. Something \u2013 perhaps the only thing, except that blondes really do have more fun \u2013 I feel sure of. A climate crisis brings daily anxiety, the newspapers are littered with transphobia, the government goes beyond incompetence to arrive somewhere between casual cruelty and calculated fascism. And on days where it feels as if there is very little to live for, just looking at him still reminds me that there is something so good in the world. Something with meaning.</p> <p>See I am, and always have been, a sucker for love, romance and utter dedication \u2013 a paradox with my ever-intensifying queer politic. For a long time, it was me who had a desperate stake in our monogamy. I am the kind of person who people describe as \u201cso attractive\u201d but, because of my hairy belly and flagrant femininity, it\u2019s often followed by: \u201cI\u2019m always attracted to people over bodies.\u201d Well, good for you. But for me, attraction has always found me in spite of my body, not because of it. And plainly put, my boyfriend has both: charm, vigour \u2013 and abs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"306a4b551c0745095164dd1e0363d245c1497fe9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/306a4b551c0745095164dd1e0363d245c1497fe9/0_956_3744_3284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Like every gay from a small town, I believed I was Carrie Bradshaw\u2019: Tom Rasmussen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"877\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Like every gay from a small town, I believed I was Carrie Bradshaw\u2019: Tom Rasmussen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now I don\u2019t want to be shallow: I wouldn\u2019t want to say that the only reason I clung tightly to monogamy was because I\u2019m a six and he\u2019s a nine. It\u2019s also a Catholic upbringing, every bit of culture I\u2019ve consumed, the fact I believed I was, like every gay from a small town, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/28/carries-straight-then-wavy-hairstyle-is-everywhere-heres-why\" title=\"\">Carrie Bradshaw</a>. And I was looking for \u201ccan\u2019t-live-without-each-other-love\u201d, because, really, I\u2019d never felt like I\u2019d really been properly loved before. By anyone. Romantic or not. And so, when I built futures in my head they were monogamous. It was all I had ever seen. And I had made love, commitment and true romance all synonymous with monogamy.</p> <p>At the christening we barely spoke. On the outside we were still the perfect gay couple: cooing over the baby, congratulating our friends, telling jokes only marginally over the edge of inappropriate for a christening. And for that day, everything appeared blissfully normal. But normality can be suffocating. On the way home, in the car, we broke: \u201cOh my God that was so normal we can\u2019t cope.\u201d So we checked ourselves into a cheap hotel that night, halfway between London and the Cotswolds, got absolutely hammered and defined the rules of our new setup. And at that point, there were no rules. Just communication. And that we can stop whenever either of us wants.</p> <p><em><strong>The second person</strong></em> I had sex with approached me in a bar and described what he wanted to do to me. I\u2019d never felt a turn-on like it. Not that I\u2019m not turned on by my partner \u2013 because various types of desire, of turn-on, are not mutually exclusive. Desire, as I\u2019m learning, exists on various planes, in various spaces. Herein lay a huge learning curve: in an open relationship, you begin to experience totally varied and different types of desire to the type of desire you feel in a monogamous setup. I\u2019ve had fast sex, slow sex, hot sex, sex I regret. I\u2019ve made love to a stranger and had feelingless sex with a good friend.</p> <p>The more people we told, the more we were asked my mother\u2019s fated question: \u201cHow do you know he won\u2019t find someone better than you?\u201d After pushing back, I realised this wasn\u2019t my friends and my mother telling me I was shit and my partner could \u2013 and perhaps should \u2013 find another, better partner. It was that everyone worries about this, too, in their own relationships. We\u2019re all terrified that we are phonies and that if someone else came along we would be exposed and left to become the Miss Havisham type we were always destined to be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve made love to a stranger and had feelingless sex with a good friend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The truth is, I don\u2019t know he won\u2019t find someone better than me. But can you know that in a monogamous relationship either? No. In fact, the answer, after a year of making mistakes and communicating about them in ways we never did before, is that it\u2019s liberating to accept that. It\u2019s freeing to see the end, because in seeing the end you have a reason to keep choosing the relationship.</p> <p>And to me it has become an absurd claim that it would be possible to find someone better than him. Because a partnership, a love, a life that took seven years to build cannot be torn apart by something as new and naive as lust and, at most, momentary love. They are different emotions. They both provide rich experience, but they are in no way comparable. If anything, my tendencies towards jealousy and self-doubt have simmered away somewhat \u2013 because here was our get-out clause. And we are still in.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier for queer couples,\u201d a heterosexual friend told me, after I told her. And I think, for countless reasons, this is true: like the fact the centre still sees our relationships as fringe; the fact that sex for a lot of queer people is a mode of finding community, touch and family; the fact that we were kept out of normative conventions of relationships until a brutally recent seven years ago. But, at the same time, there is still the same fear, the same worry, the same risk of loss. So easier feels like too easy a word. Perhaps more accepted.</p> <p>Culturally, we always think about the rush of the new: those heady days when you meet your partner and every move they make drives you to distraction. Then we do the merry dance of less sex, less communication, less fun, more bills, more plans, more stress, until we die or someone leaves.</p> <p>And, yes, with every new partner I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have an experience with over this moment in our relationship, I\u2019ve experienced the rush of the new. But the rush of the new spills over into my primary partnership, too: new dynamics form, each scenario brings with it something for us to negotiate, and our sex is more adventurous than ever: perhaps because we learned new moves elsewhere or perhaps because we have a reinvigorated sense of desire for each other knowing that someone, elsewhere, has found this body in front of you desirable in new ways, too.</p> <p>Our open relationship wasn\u2019t born out of a lack of sex. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve had that phase and we really did consider going open. But we decided then that if we were ever to do it, it couldn\u2019t come from a place of trying to cure a wound, or fill a gap. That\u2019s when the primary partnership ends. In fact, we\u2019d only recently talked about getting married and then we decided to try the idea that non-monogamy might be an even more immense, powerful commitment to each other than a ring and a register.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We do the merry dance of less sex, less communication, less fun, more bills, more plans, more stress, until we die</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How could that be possible? How could sleeping with other people be more of a commitment than marriage? Because in sleeping with others you are allowing your partner a deeper expression of their desires. Marriage is fantastic in many ways, but it is also a means of state control \u2013 one which produces couples who care for each other, and children who will become workers. But in the case of openness, I am committing to the fullness of his desires and mine, and the risks that come with expressing them. Commitment is another word I had got wrong, too. I always equated it with sacrifice, but I\u2019m coming to learn it means a willingness to understand the changes in a person, to understand their fullness.</p> <p>Of course, there are hard parts. With certain aspects \u2013 silly insecurities, double standards, needing to know every detail \u2013 you have to take on the individual responsibility of self-management of (some of) your own emotions. You have to accept that sometimes you are going to feel strange things and that your partner cannot be responsible for curing them. Or even always listening to them if they are unfair and unfounded. I\u2019d been on multiple dates with someone, and felt deep worry when he told me he was going on a second. This was a feeling I had to\u2013 with the help of generous friends \u2013 self-manage. And lo and behold, he came home after what he described as an \u201cimpossibly average\u201d date.</p> <p>Something I\u2019ve come to learn, something necessary for the success of truly any relationship, is that love is not control. Monogamy, too, is not control \u2013 and this is not my accusation. Because whether monogamous, open, polyamorous, the terms of the relationship should be agreed upon by each person within it, mutually, and not simply put there because it\u2019s what \u2013 literally \u2013 the Bible says. I have radical queer friends who adore monogamy. I\u2019ve met viscerally dull couples who are radically polyamorous. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason for who it fits.</p> <p>But the point is that non-monogamy is actually about care. It\u2019s about seeing your partner, and yourself, as someone separate to you who has desires, feelings, emotions that they want to, and should be able to, share with other people \u2013 not just you. For us, at least, it\u2019s created a dynamic of tantalising flux: one where sometimes you feel lonely, sometimes you feel powerful, sometimes you feel more in love than ever. But in understanding these dynamics that whirl around inside, and between, us both it feels more likely than ever that neither of us will find a better partner. Because if we can learn with empathy, compassion and selflessness to understand each other in what is deemed such a testing situation; if we can both let each other go for an evening every now and then, the reunion feels so much sweeter. Because you come home to someone who is committing to work hard to see you, to make space in their complicated emotional life for yours. And vice versa. That feels like more commitment, more love, than anything I\u2019ve experienced before.</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "artanddesign/2022/may/22/cornelia-parker-tate-britain-london-review", "type": "article", "sectionId": "artanddesign", "sectionName": "Art and design", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T12:00:47Z", "webTitle": "Cornelia Parker review \u2013 the redemptive art of making something out of nothing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/22/cornelia-parker-tate-britain-london-review", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/may/22/cornelia-parker-tate-britain-london-review", "fields": {"headline": "Cornelia Parker review \u2013 the redemptive art of making something out of nothing", "trailText": "The artist transforms things unnoticed, or barely there, into a poetry of objects in this superbly curated retrospective", "body": "<p>The enthralling <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/cornelia-parker?gclid=Cj0KCQjwspKUBhCvARIsAB2IYus215Bg5HUuf2-NK2vQqoAR9iQyQfVlWf01fHhKrm5DwSSERiT16eIaAsOtEALw_wcB\">Cornelia Parker survey</a> now open at Tate Britain is about 20 years overdue \u2013 but far better late than never.

The old Thermos, the Bakelite clock, a hand-me-down pram, perished wellies: everything in its never-ending explosion is so redolent of an England that is forever passing but never quite gone. And the whole spectacular period piece, repeated in drifting shadows on the walls, alludes to explosions of all kinds: astral, accidental, human-made.

The cracks between paving slabs in London\u2019s Bunhill Fields, where Daniel Defoe and William Blake are buried, are cast into a bronze tracery that hangs just above the ground like the leading of an old grave, or the grid of a minimalist sculpture. <a href=\"https://frithstreetgallery.viewingrooms.com/content/feature/97/artworks-9383-cornelia-parker-prison-wall-abstract-a-man-escaped-2012-2013/\">Marks left by workmen</a> pointing the perimeter walls of Pentonville prison, attentively noticed and photographed by Parker, look like the monochrome abstractions of <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/4126#works\">Robert Motherwell</a>.</p> <p>Parker\u2019s own terms for what she makes cannot be bettered. <em>Sculptural Negatives</em>, for instance, are exactly as they sound. The residue collected by a silversmith from his hand-engraved inscriptions becomes a <a href=\"https://www.inglebygallery.com/exhibitions/598/works/image2/\">small shining heap</a>, instantly evocative of unspoken words. The cutting of tracks into a black lacquer disc, performed at Abbey Road Studios, produces fine coils of lacquer that Parker tangles into vibrating sound clouds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2a0e6d16b647aadd06d29b16b09c9dae57e8201c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a0e6d16b647aadd06d29b16b09c9dae57e8201c/0_0_3000_3012/996.jpg\" alt=\"The Negative of Words, 1996.

A murderer\u2019s gun is reduced to a pile of rust-red dust: its own deadly remains. Photographs of glowering clouds turn out to have been taken by the artist using a camera that once belonged to Rudolph H\u00f6ss, camp commandant at Auschwitz. An Oliver Twist doll, one eye shut, the other open, the mouth a comical cakehole, so to speak, has been chopped in two by the very guillotine used to decapitate Marie Antoinette.</p> <p>To look through the same lens as a mass-murdering Nazi must surely mean more to Parker than it ever could to us; my sense is that the resulting images can never hold quite the same significance either. And meaning is vital to this art of metaphor, evocation and allusion. A series of Rorschach prints have been created using rattlesnake venom and its antidote mixed with black and white ink. Parker commissioned these substances from local farmers and pharmacists during a residency in Texas. But you need to know this for the prints to hold any potency, which is nothing less than the power to kill or indeed save you.</p> <p>Parker always leaves space for argument; there is nothing autocratic here. The hand-stitched backs of old button cards, revealing the labour of long-ago women, make beautiful abstract drawings; but they are only photographs, not the actual artefacts themselves. Hasn\u2019t the human touch been erased? Blackboards covered in tabloid headlines chalked up by primary school children play upon their innocent ignorance of what it is they reproduce; but should that innocence be played upon? And what does it actually mean to take a sawn-off shotgun and saw it up again into particles? Take a disputatious friend if you\u2019re visiting this show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c0905f2c44e09998c45c9e8dd827cc021a10945b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0905f2c44e09998c45c9e8dd827cc021a10945b/0_0_2343_2929/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sawn Up Sawn Off Shotgun (top) and Precipitated Gun, 2015 by Cornelia Parker.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sawn Up Sawn Off Shotgun (top) and Precipitated Gun, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Cornelia Parker and Frith Street Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The later the work, the more political and elegiac. A terrific group of films includes her drone footage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4KKgkDP6Pw\">of a deserted House of Commons</a>, suddenly very small, haunted by newspapers that gradually flutter into life as if trying to speak to the absent MPs. Her study of the making of Remembrance Day poppies notes the astonishing analogies between the red belts of paper, shunted and drilled through the machines, and the great mounding heap of discarded matter, tossed aside like fallen soldiers. Parker has a poet\u2019s eye for every detail that might count.</p> <p>Most affecting of all is a film portrait of a Palestinian Muslim who has been making crowns of thorns for 40 years, providing a service for Christian pilgrims to Bethlehem. The film is subtle and capacious, so that one learns the process while pondering the strange ritual by which people imitate Christ\u2019s suffering. His calloused hands manipulate the barbs with ease, but his heart is not hardened. All he wants is a halfway decent airport for better trade, and peace in the Middle East.</p> <p>The exhibition is superbly arranged so that the works speak back and forth to each other all the time \u2013 grid to grid, Rorschach to Rorschach, shed to shed. The missing buttons echo the faceless medals that show only the backs of political heads (Bush and Blair, made during the Iraq war). The flattened silver returns with the flattened instruments in <em>Perpetual Canon</em>, their dangling shadows drifting round the walls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"101fb885ce02ea0b7a0c6c6a1012e6b40b04e156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/101fb885ce02ea0b7a0c6c6a1012e6b40b04e156/0_0_5515_3669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Perpetual Canon, 2004: 60 flattened instruments once used by a brass band.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perpetual Canon, 2004 by Cornelia Parker: 60 flattened instruments once used by a brass band.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sense of a mind unfolding expands into the wall texts, which were written by Parker herself. They amount to an additional medium. It is not just that they offer a crucial backstory of her methods \u2013 scorching, flattening, stretching, shooting, spilling, dropping \u2013 but that they add words as another form of art.</p> <p>The final work at Tate Britain was made in 2022. It takes her approach to words, objects and meanings about as far as it can go. A greenhouse stands alone in a shadowy gallery, its overhead bulb (think of the potting shed) coming and going in the rhythms of an anxious human breath. Its glass is marked all over with chalk dabs, made using chunks of the white cliffs of Dover. Nothing is growing. All you can see are the ecclesiastical-looking salvaged tiles from Pugin\u2019s House of Commons lining the floor.

Davis and his senior players were collectively frustrated \u2013 \u201cthe truth is it haunted us\u201d \u2013 that England had not won a grand slam since 1957.</p> <p>Before Davis took over in the autumn of 1979, England had suffered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/feb/14/eddie-butler-1979-wales-england\" title=\"\">heavy 27-3 defeat</a> against Wales in the Five Nations championship in Cardiff,</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5415f7916c43d9a8491629d157997d527ba4e2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5415f7916c43d9a8491629d157997d527ba4e2e/0_348_3825_2295/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Davis, with the ball, taking part in a centenary match, England and Wales v Ireland and Scotland, 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Davis, with the ball, taking part in a centenary match, England and Wales v Ireland and Scotland, 1970. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> and they also lost 10-9 to the All Blacks in Davis\u2019s first match in charge. Following the New Zealand game, though, Beaumont pulled Davis aside and told him he had a good feeling about the forthcoming Five Nations season. Pick the right team, the players reckoned, and they would have a decent chance against anyone.</p> <p>Happily Davis had a shrewd eye for playing talent, and his elevation of the Gloucester prop Phil Blakeway was a particular masterstroke. Davis believed a strong \u201cspine\u201d was key to building a consistent winning team, and his honesty and enthusiasm swiftly endeared him to the squad.</p> <p>Another canny move saw England abandon their familiar routine of gathering on Sundays, when they were still sore from their club fixtures, in favour of training more intensively on Monday nights at Stourbridge RFC in the West Midlands, with members of the public free to attend. There were several other innovations, not least when Davis walked into a meeting carrying an odd-looking contraption. It was the first time the national squad had ever seen an overhead projector.</p> <p>The senior players were also consulted more often, and soon grew accustomed to Davis\u2019s enthusiastic use of words such as \u201cwhoosh\u201d rather than \u201cruck\u201d to describe exactly how he wanted his forwards to attack contact situations.</p> <p>Ireland were well beaten (24-9) in the first game of the 1980 championship, followed by a 17-13 victory over France in Paris. Next up was a 9-8 win over Wales at Twickenham, memorable for the sending-off of the Wales flanker Paul Ringer after 15 minutes for an alleged high and late challenge on John Horton. Dusty Hare kicked the late winning penalty, setting up a grand slam occasion against Scotland at Murrayfield.</p> <p>Davis was smart enough to realise that his senior players needed no extra motivation, and deliberately made himself scarce as kick-off approached, happy to leave the stage to others. England duly won 30-18 to clinch their long-awaited slam, but it was to prove the high-water mark of the team\u2019s fortunes for the next decade. Several senior players subsequently retired and, after failing to win the Five Nations in 1981 and 1982, they collected the wooden spoon in 1983, prompting Davis to joke that \u201cI\u2019ve turned wine into water\u201d. He stepped aside shortly afterwards to concentrate on his teaching career. Of his 20 Tests in charge, England won 10 and drew three.</p> <p>Born in Lichfield, Staffordshire, to Olive (nee Thompson), who had a hairdressing salon and also worked on film sets, and Alec Davis, a semi-professional music hall singer and movie stunt man, Davis was educated at Torquay boys\u2019 grammar school before training to be a teacher at St Luke\u2019s College in Exeter. He was still at St Luke\u2019s when chosen for his first cap against Wales in 1963, playing the game in cheap football boots that he had dyed black because proper rugby footwear was too expensive. In the same year he toured with England to New Zealand, dislocating a shoulder in the second Test in Christchurch but bravely playing on and continuing to win line-out ball with his one good arm. </p> <p>Subsequently Davis trained as an instructor officer in the Royal Navy, spending time at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in Devon and 18 months at HMS Raleigh at Torpoint in Cornwall. He turned out for Devonport Services and Combined Services, also representing Devon and then Staffordshire, whom he captained to victory in the county championship in 1970.</p> <p>Like his father, Davis was renowned for his singing ability, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/17/archive-1977-king-elvis-presley-anniversary\" title=\"\">Elvis Presley</a> among his specialities, and was once described in the Twickenham programme as \u201calmost certainly the best pop singer ever to play rugby football for England. Very good on Bye Bye Blackbird.\u201d</p> <p>Davis also excelled at basketball and water polo, and combined playing for Harlequins RFC with teaching jobs at Haileybury in Hertfordshire and St Paul\u2019s in London.</p> <p>He met Jenny Hull, a school nurse, at Haileybury in 1967, and they married in 1969. In 1974 they moved to Sherborne in Dorset, where he became a maths and PE teacher at Sherborne school and helped guide the school\u2019s first XV to four consecutive unbeaten seasons from 1975 to 1978. </p> <p>His purple England tracksuit was the solitary clue to his other life. Even after being diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, he continued to coach at Sherborne RFC, and his kind hearted, encouraging nature never left him.</p> <p>He is survived by Jenny, and their daughter, Jo, and twin sons, Simon and Peter.</p> <p> \u2022 Alec Michael Davis, rugby union player and coach, born 23 January 1942; died 10 May 2022</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "film/2022/may/22/cop-secret-review-unsubtle-icelandic-police-comedy", "type": "article", "sectionId": "film", "sectionName": "Film", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T11:30:46Z", "webTitle": "Cop Secret review \u2013 unsubtle Icelandic police comedy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/22/cop-secret-review-unsubtle-icelandic-police-comedy", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/22/cop-secret-review-unsubtle-icelandic-police-comedy", "fields": {"headline": "Cop Secret review \u2013 unsubtle Icelandic police comedy", "trailText": "Two rival cops are paired up with not quite unforeseen results", "body": "<p>In this rowdy cop-movie pastiche from Iceland, a hot shot detective is partnered with his arch rival, only to find that their mutual animosity is a mask for deeper feelings.

However, Christie\u2019s characterisation of Poirot centres on English mispronunciation. The excuse is that he is speaking a second tongue, so Jonathan Church\u2019s perky production of an adaptation by US playwright Ken Ludwig (Lend Me a Tenor) is careful also to give Poirot some impeccable French, plus Hungarian and Russian with two of the polyglot suspects.</p> <p>Despite Christie\u2019s economic heft in theatre, this novel is not often staged, likely due to the challenge of depicting locomotion.

Despite the millions Rupert Murdoch has invested in his newly launched television channel, and the supposedly magnetic presence of Piers Morgan, its numbers have sometimes been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/04/piers-morgan-ratings-dive-as-talktv-struggles-to-attract-viewers\">so low</a> that the official broadcasting rating agency has not registered a single viewer. Last Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/25/piers-morgan-uncensored-review-a-bad-jeremy-clarkson-tribute-act-with-added-trump\">Piers Morgan Uncensored</a>, the nightly showcase of debate and un-woke opinions intended to be TalkTV\u2019s centrepiece, was said to have attracted 24,000 people, and then lost over half of them, leaving it with an estimated audience of 10,000.</p> <p>Over at GB News, the similarly right-inclined talk-based outlet that has survived its equally disastrous launch, it was presumably pints of bitter and sausage rolls all round: that night its competing offering \u2013 hosted by the somewhat niche Canadian pundit Mark Steyn \u2013 reportedly won the ratings battle with a princely initial viewing figure of 54,000.</p> <p>It was for research rather than recreation that I <a href=\"https://watch.talk.tv/watch/replay/12911961\">watched</a> Morgan\u2019s show that night. It was an underwhelming experience: a very long hour of the host affecting to be what Noel Gallagher once memorably termed \u201ca man with a fork in a world of soup\u201d, fuming about everything from the governor of the Bank of England (who is \u201crunning around like a \u2026 hyperbolic headless chicken\u201d) to an unnamed police officer who had allegedly refused to work outside office hours. </p> <p>During an item that began with Morgan complaining about the royal family apologising for the British empire, a journalist from the Sunday Times had to inform him that they had done no such thing; Morgan\u2019s thoughts about the UK\u2019s colonial legacy found no expression more eloquent than the claim that \u201cthere is good and bad in all these things\u201d. For a programme intended to \u201cupset all the right people\u201d, it is weirdly anodyne: proof, perhaps, that if you sell yourself to the public as an irate scourge of snowflakes, \u201ccancel culture\u201d and all the rest, it is probably best not to look like someone going through the motions.</p> <p>Even if Morgan\u2019s show \u2013 and, indeed, TalkTV itself \u2013 prove beyond rescue, they are one small part of a change that may well be here to stay, born in the madly polarised world of American news broadcasting and then taken to its logical conclusion by social media. Thanks partly to an anarchic, amateurish spirit that seems truer to its Brexity values than the slickness of Murdoch\u2019s new offering, GB News might just about endure: though its ratings are not exactly mass-market, they seem significantly higher than Talk TV\u2019s (Nigel Farage\u2019s Monday-Thursday show has recently attracted a peak audience of 99,500), and the channel exerts a much bigger influence through the clips it endlessly circulates online.</p> <p>Talk-based radio has probably <a href=\"https://pressgazette.co.uk/rajar-speech-radio-stations-see-large-audience-boost-in-the-first-quarter-of-2022/\">never been as high-profile</a> as it is now, and the millions who listen to such voices as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/28/joe-rogan-neil-young-spotify-streaming-service\">US podcaster Joe Rogan</a> \u2013 said to have sold his show to Spotify for \u00a375m \u2013 shows that the market for a mixture of comedy, ranting, conspiracy theory and \u201cdebate\u201d is huge. Scroll through your news feed, or flick through YouTube, and the sense of a profound shift in how many people receive and understand what some people still call \u201cthe news\u201d will be confirmed: in an ocean of \u201ctalk\u201d, the complexities and nuances of the real world are always in danger of disappearing.</p> <p>The \u201clegacy\u201d media have long since been infected by the same virus. The best news broadcasting, it seems to me, is necessarily based around reporting. Its polar opposite is exemplified by the insane levels of attention paid by orthodox news outlets to such people as <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1611795/Laurence-Fox-Boris-Johnson-Cost-Of-Living-Food-Prices-Obesity-Reclaim-Party-VN\">Farage</a> and Laurence Fox, and the comically mouthy pundits \u2013 from both left and right \u2013 who endlessly appear on TV news channels, and aim to sooner or later make it on to BBC One\u2019s Question Time. The first demands resources, time, care and attention; punditry and polemic, by contrast, require little more than cab fares and paltry appearance fees. Herein lies one overlooked danger in the government\u2019s hostility to the BBC and its plans to privatise Channel 4: if broadcasting is left to the market, the reduction of news to \u201ctalk\u201d will only accelerate.</p> <p>Clearly, there was never a golden age of bias-free reporting, the media has always promoted loudmouths, and its big players have long used their clout to exercise power without responsibility. But in the pre-\u201ctalk\u201d era, the dominant model of success in news and current affairs began with vox pops and door-knocks, and moved on to dedicated work on breaking big stories.</p> <p>That ideal still exists. But a much more alluring career path now centres on sitting behind an expensive-looking microphone, endlessly venting, and trying to pile on likes and subscribers. If something happens, the point is not to go out and understand it, but to quickly take a position and sound off about it: your job is not really to cover the news, but to see if you can make headlines yourself.</p> <p>\u201cTalk\u201d culture, moreover, has long since bled into politics. The fact that the UK has a government led by a former newspaper columnist was always going to make us a case study in this syndrome, and so it has proved. Deporting refugees to Rwanda is the kind of idea that might have been proposed by a GB News host or some irate caller to LBC, and it is now being rolled out into the real world. Much the same point could be made about Brexit.</p> <p>But the best example is surely Boris Johnson and his colleagues\u2019 increasingly tedious \u201cwar on woke\u201d, whereby ministers sound off about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/remote-working-uk-equal-jacob-rees-mogg\">evils of working from home</a>, the sanctity of statues and whatever else, and their words dissolve into the same white noise that emanates from the mouths of Morgan et al. Herein lies a model of government copied from Donald Trump, whereby leaders are not there to actually do anything, but to endlessly orchestrate outrage and division to their advantage.</p> <p>And yet. Morgan\u2019s ratings suggest that, in the UK at least, the appeal of endless \u201ctalk\u201d has its limits. TalkTV\u2019s basic mistake, perhaps, has been a failure to understand that the politics of polarisation and fury peaked back in 2016; and that after our drawn-out exit from the EU and our grim national experience of the pandemic, most people are now weary and jaded, and in no mood to spend endless hours watching and listening to angry people. The vast majority either want to consume as little news as possible or tune into something calm, even-handed and rooted in reality.</p> <p>The war in Ukraine has provided a sobering reminder of the importance of on-the-ground reporting and journalistic expertise. Something comparable applies to this country\u2019s cost-of-living crisis, which demands not hot takes, but sensitive coverage and serious solutions. In that context, who cares about a view of the world that seems to extend no further than a set of studio walls? What matters is the single mother who cannot feed her kids or heat her house, the family taking refuge in a Kyiv basement, and stories that prove one thing beyond doubt: that \u201ctalk\u201d \u2013 whether \u201cuncensored\u201d or not \u2013 is not just cheap, but irrelevant.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He enjoyed the rare experience for any politician of being liked and admired both by his political colleagues and his constituents, because he was demonstrably a man of passionate conviction who delivered on his commitments and also because he was someone who was practical, hard-working and never forgot a name or face.</p> <p>Blizzard was a schoolteacher for 24 years before being elected as an MP and was understandably familiar with the circumstances of his constituency, having been a councillor for 10 years on Waveney district council (now East Suffolk district council) from 1987, and its leader from 1991 until 1997. Although he made his first formal entry into politics as the result of a toss of a coin, flipped to decide the winner after a tied vote for the council seat in the Lowestoft suburb of Pakefield, his drive for political progress was never casual.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0880e1ec09125452bc6dffed81d2233c53d8c56c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0880e1ec09125452bc6dffed81d2233c53d8c56c/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Blizzard campaigning at Beccles Medical Centre, Beccles, Suffolk, accompanied by Liz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Blizzard campaigning at Beccles Medical Centre, Beccles, Suffolk, accompanied by Liz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As an MP, he continued to pursue local issues for the benefit of his constituents, notably securing a relief road for Lowestoft\u2019s gridlocked traffic and campaigning vigorously for a third bridge in the town across Lake Lothing, the \u00a373.4m project finally securing approval in 2015. But he was also interested in energy policy, Latin American trade and animal welfare.</p> <p>Blizzard fought fiercely in the Commons in favour of the Hunting Act 2004, and was still seeking proper enforcement of this legislation while undergoing treatment for cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive cancer of the bile duct.</p> <p>At Westminster Blizzard was a member of the environmental audit select committee for two years until appointed a parliamentary private secretary in 1999, first to Lady (Helene) Hayman as agriculture minister and, after the 2001 election, to Nick Brown at the Department for Work and Pensions.

He was appointed to the whips\u2019 office in Gordon Brown\u2019s government in 2007 and was promoted to become a senior whip the following year.</p> <p>Blizzard was hugely enthusiastic about jazz. He was secretary of the all-party parliamentary group for jazz appreciation, and founded the parliamentary jazz awards and the Lowestoft Jazz Weekend at the Seagull theatre in his constituency. He was a supporter of Lowestoft Town FC.</p> <p>Born in Bury St Edmunds, the son of Arthur Blizzard, a signwriter, and his wife, Joan, he was educated at Culford school before studying for a BA at the University of Birmingham. He taught first at Southfield secondary school in Gravesend, Kent, for three years before being appointed head of English at Crayford school, Bexley, south-east London, in 1976. There he also volunteered to help teach English in the Asian community in the area for the Community Relations Council. In 1986 he returned to East Anglia as head of English at Lynn Grove high school, Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk.</p> <p>Blizzard married Lyn Chance in 1978.

The researchers, however, stressed that it could also be the result of pandemic-induced stress and that further research was needed to explore the link.</p> <p>Our muscles are usually paralysed during REM sleep, when most dreaming occurs, meaning our bodies remain quiet and still. In people with a rare condition called REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), however, this temporary paralysis doesn\u2019t occur, leading them to physically act out their dreams. \u201cThey may punch or flail their arms in the air, make running movements, or even jump out of bed, sometimes resulting in injuries to themselves or their partner,\u201d said Prof Yaping Liu at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who led the research.</p> <p>The condition affects 2-3% of adults over the age of 60 across the developed world, and in some cases can be a precursor to the development of Parkinson\u2019s disease.</p> <p>Liu and his colleagues became interested in whether the prevalence of dream-enactment disorder had increased during the pandemic after reading several scientific reports of people developing Parkinson\u2019s-like symptoms shortly after becoming infected with Covid.</p> <p>They examined data from the international Covid sleep study, an online survey of 26,539 people from 15 countries. Among the questions, it asked the participants if they had been told, or suspected themselves of acting out their dreams while they slept.</p> <p>\u201cWe found that the prevalence of dream-enactment behaviour was two to four times higher than previous studies that have been conducted in the general population during non-pandemic times,\u201d said Liu. \u201cMoreover, in those subjects who reported a Covid-19 diagnosis, it was two or three times higher, compared with subjects without infection.\u201d</p> <p>Their study, published in the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.13613\">Journal of Sleep Research</a>, found that 8% of people with a Covid diagnosis regularly experienced the phenomenon, against 3% of those who had never been infected. It was not able, however, to determine whether these behaviours occurred only during the infection itself or continued after people had recovered from Covid.</p> <p>Prof Adam Zeman, an expert in sleep disorders at the University of Exeter, said the finding was intriguing, but raised more questions than it answers. \u201cThe overall rate of dream-enactment detected in the study was extremely high, suggesting that a variety of different sleep behaviours may have led respondents to report it.</p> <p>\u201cIf Covid-19 truly raises the rate of dream-enactment, there may be a variety of explanations, from anxiety to obstructive sleep apnoea,\u201d he said, referring to a condition in which a person\u2019s breathing stops and starts during sleep.</p> <p>The possibility of a link between Covid-19 infection and a form of Parkinson\u2019s disease would require further research using more objective ways of diagnosing it, he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/covid-lockdown-dreams-reflected-our-claustrophobia-and-lack-of-control\">Covid lockdown dreams reflected our claustrophobia and lack of control</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prof Michele Hu at the University of Oxford, who is studying the links between Parkinson\u2019s disease and sleep, said the definitive way of diagnosing RBD would be overnight sleep study, which is usually conducted in hospital.

When the plants are forced to dig deep for their nutrients and water it makes them stronger, focusing their energies on what really matters, the grapes, rather than sending out billowing canopies of leaves.</p> <p>And so you have rule number one for wine soils: they tend to be poor, the kind in which other crops may not thrive. Not just any poor soil will do, either: differences can have an enormous effect on a wine\u2019s character. At least as much influence as climate, topography, grape variety and the various techniques the winemaker uses back at the cellar. For many wine producers, the notion that soil trumps all other variables has become a kind of credo. The first line on the back label is often a reference to limestone, schist, granite or slate and this increasingly creeps on to the front, too. Once, the most in-demand wine-producing consultants, such as Michel Rolland or Helen Turely, were employed for advice on when to pick and what to do in the cellar.

But the way specific soils interact with certain grapevines in particular climates does produce certain stylistic effects. It makes sense to talk about a limestone wine or a schist wine, just as it does to talk about a cabernet sauvignon or a grenache.</p> <p>A classic experiment to show the effects of soil would involve lining up a pair of chardonnays, one apiece from the neighbouring terroirs of Petit Chablis and Chablis in chilly northern Burgundy. To narrow down the variables, make it the same vintage and producer. The chablis, grown on the appellation\u2019s famous Kimmeridgian limestone, formed in the upper Jurassic and rich in fossilised seashells, will have an extra degree of depth, intensity and verve; the lighter, brisker, simpler petit chablis is grown on younger Portlandian limestone.</p> <p>Once you have the dirt bug it\u2019s hard not to test other theories: that the schist in Catalonia\u2019s Priorat and Portugal\u2019s Douro leads to wines of distinctive depth, power and mineral complexity. Or that the highly prized limestone of Burgundy, Champagne, the Loire and Jerez makes for wines of unusual elegance, balance and fine-tuned definition. And the volcanic soils of Etna or Santorini often have an extra electric crackle of acidity. Although it soon becomes clear that, when it comes to understanding what goes on beneath the vines, we\u2019ve only just scratched the surface.</p> <h2>Six wines that reflect their vineyards\u2019 soils</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15cb4fba2086f7f36de4b8c2417108bc352f4ac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15cb4fba2086f7f36de4b8c2417108bc352f4ac0/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Six wines that reflect their terroirs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">may win</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Tesco Finest Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon, Coonawarra</strong> South Australia 2018 (\u00a39, <a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/296424558\">Tesco</a>)<br>South Australian region Coonawarra\u2019s famous terra rossa soil (a red, iron-oxide-rich topsoil over limestone) has proved itself ideally suited to producing superbly balanced cabernet sauvignon.

So there was no small excitement about its follow-up, an adaptation of the novel that introduced Rooney as a new literary star. While <em>Normal People</em> told a relatively simple story of the on-off relationship between two schoolmates, whose furtive love affair is rekindled when they meet up again as students, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/30/joe-alwyn-conversations-with-friends-sex-scenes\">Conversations With Friends</a></em> spins a messier and more complicated yarn<strong>,</strong> which, perhaps inevitably, has had a more mixed reception since it hit screens last week.</p> <p>Age, class and differing sexualities intertwine in the relationship of two couples, one a decade older than the other, who meet through a spoken-word poetry gig, and go on to form an asymmetrical foursome. The older pair, writer Melissa (Jemima Kirke) and jobbing actor Nick (Joe Alwyn), are locked in an affectionate but apparently sexless marriage. The younger two, Frances (Alison Oliver) and Bobbi (Sasha Lane), used to be lovers. \u201cI\u2019m her muse,\u201d says gobby Bobbi, by way of introduction to the sleek, older essayist. \u201cWe dropped the fucking and kept the poetry.\u201d</p> <p>The line is delivered by Lane with such cheeky charisma that you\u2019d have to have a vitrified heart not to fall for her, as Melissa duly does. It\u2019s not long before Melissa has introduced Nick into the circle, and sparks start to fly between him and Frances. The casting of Lane, an actor of African American and Maori heritage who made her name in Andrea Arnold\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/16/american-honey-review-mark-kermode\">American Honey</a></em>, as Rooney\u2019s convent bad girl, pays off handsomely, decisively answering the criticism of tickbox casting in <em>Normal People.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f3789568693faf8ecfcbd2a4822b7025c8767b0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3789568693faf8ecfcbd2a4822b7025c8767b0b/0_0_1598_2560/624.jpg\" alt=\"Conversations With Friends\" width=\"624\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was love at first sight, as soon as she was sent the novel for consideration, says the 26-year-old actor over Zoom from New York. \u201cI read it within like two hours: that\u2019s how much I fell in love with it.\u201d She had recently given birth and was getting fidgety. \u201cI was in Texas, spending way too much time with my newborn, so we needed to see other people. This was the first time that I\u2019d felt, \u2018Wow, I want this. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As it was all playing out at the height of the Covid era, what it took was a succession of nail-biting, long-distance \u201cchemistry tests\u201d with her Irish co-star Oliver. Even over Zoom, there\u2019s a tangible forcefield around the two young actors, which ties Lane up in knots as she tries to explain it. \u201cSometimes as Bobbi is watching Frances look at someone else, I, as Sasha, get jealous, which is weird because, obviously, I don\u2019t romantically love Alison,\u201d she says. In interview, as in the series, they slip into a comfortable rhythm. Lane, who arrived with a reputation for edgy brilliance \u2013 not least as teenage runaway Star in <em>American Honey</em> \u2013 leaps into every silence. Oliver, who was still at drama school when she auditioned for the role, is more reserved. \u201c...And then it was actually the day after I finished college that I got the call,\u201d she says of her casting, with an understatedness that would do her character Frances proud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c69330c67263c44771eb4a7f8fa6a6721707932e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c69330c67263c44771eb4a7f8fa6a6721707932e/0_477_5042_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Bobbi and Frances, with Jemima Kirke as Melissa and Joe Alwyn as Nick in Conversations With Friends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Bobbi and Frances, with Jemima Kirke as Melissa and Joe Alwyn as Nick in Conversations With Friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Enda Bowe/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a student at the Dublin academy that <em>Normal People</em>\u2019s Paul Mescal had attended, which is attached to the college at which Rooney herself had studied, Oliver was well aware that she was up for one of the hottest roles the TV industry could offer. \u201cSally\u2019s books were just everywhere,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWhen Covid happened, and I was moving back to isolate with my family in Cork, my roommate gave me <em>Conversations With Friends</em> for the train home. I hadn\u2019t read a book like it before, and it was kind of a surreal thing, because when the audition came, I felt like they were all real people.\u201d</p> <p>The imposing buildings of Trinity College, where both <em>Normal People</em>\u2019s Connell and Marianne and Frances and Bobbi are also students, provides a strong visual link between the two series, which are produced by the same company and both directed by Lenny Abrahamson. The Dublin of late-night essay crises in student house-shares is set against the wealthier ambience of Melissa and Nick\u2019s life, so carefully curated as to have become as glazed as the artworks on the walls. Their insouciance is shored up by money, but they need the different sort of power that Frances and Bobbi can bring \u2013 of youth, and passion and devil-may-care recklessness. .</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Someone told me that the minute you turn 20, you go into this psychological puberty.

How does this familiar Rooney trope of alienation relate to the two actors? Alison Oliver grew up in a big family in a well-to-do suburb of Cork city. She went to an all-girls school with a gang of primary school friends who are still her best friends today, \u201cso I didn\u2019t have that kind of feeling of isolation as such. But I remember someone saying to me that the minute you turn 20, you go into this psychological puberty. I thought that was so true.

I have always been a bit of a loner.\u201d</p> <p>When the time came to travel to Belfast, where most of the series was filmed in the spring of 2021, she spent a week settling in, before her brother \u2013 who decades earlier had left the family with their father \u2013 travelled out to join her, bringing her daughter, who by then was 18 months old. \u201cShe became just like a little homie on the set. We were each other\u2019s community, and I think she helped, because we were totally locked down at the time.\u201d</p> <p>Lane describes her brother as her best friend, who helped her to cope with a success that hit her like an express train. She was spotted as a 19-year-old student on a spring beach holiday by the director Andrea Arnold, who had just lost her lead for <em>American Honey</em>. A month later she had dropped out of college and set off into the unknown. \u201cEspecially when I started, I was not mentally in the best place. Then you go from being in a regular kind of life in Texas to moving to LA after a movie. It was a really heightened experience,\u201d she says.

Oliver agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s only when she really hits rock bottom that we get to see it.\u201d</p> <p>In earlier episodes, the pain does indeed play across Oliver\u2019s face, but Frances is so wilfully inscrutable that it\u2019s like a photographic negative that can only be read through Bobbi, whose huffy interrogations and demanding silences make the series increasingly seem like a double act. \u201cI think female relationships are a lot more complex and a lot more intimate, even if they\u2019re toxic,\u201d says Lane. \u201cThe reason that Bobbi and Frances have a big hold on the show is because it\u2019s two women, regardless of whether they have sex or not.\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t, however, look to Rooney for easy resolutions. \u201cWhat I found so interesting about it,\u201d says Oliver, \u201cis that it is a very modern love story and, to me anyway, it feels like something new. Frances really does love two people at the same time. It\u2019s saying that any way people want to live their life is OK. Love is always going to be complicated.

These problems can potentially be solved by selling one\u2019s business to a buyer who\u2019s most familiar with the company: its employees. Doing so not only creates an exit strategy but also possibly saves jobs.</p> <p>Then there are the tax savings. Big tax savings.</p> <p>In a typical employee-ownership transaction an entity owned by the company\u2019s employees (which can include the owner) is created. That entity then buys a portion or all of the company\u2019s shares. A bank generally finances this purchase so the employees are not out of pocket (remember: this is a benefit plan). The company pays back the bank, and gets a tax deduction by doing so. But there\u2019s even more. The income from the company that\u2019s allocated to the entity is also non-taxable to its owners.</p> <p>Those two reasons for selling shares to your employees are persuasive enough. But there\u2019s another, even more significant benefit: ownership makes for a more profitable company and a better place to work.</p> <p>Research from <a href=\"https://cleo.rutgers.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EOF-REPORT-EMPLOYEE-OWNED-FIRMS-IN-THE-COVID-19-PANDEMIC.pdf\">Rutgers University</a> showed companies with an employee stock ownership plan laid off fewer employees, cut fewer salaries and required less help from federal aid packages during the pandemic. According to <a href=\"https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/community-health/news/employee-owned-businesses-foster-healthier-local-economies\">Kaiser Permanente</a>, employees who have equity in the companies they work for report 33% higher median income, 53% longer median job tenure and 92% higher household net worth. Employers say their profit margins are 8.5% higher and that they are three to four times more likely to retain staff. In short, employees love having a piece of the pie and they show that gratitude by working harder and staying longer.</p> <p>\u201cBeing part-owner of a company is a fabulous thing because you have a little say,\u201d one worker at an industrial laundry service in Cleveland <a href=\"https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/jobs/mission-possible-companies-employee-owned/95-dfab726a-20fb-4c76-800b-57b39c6c4021\">says</a>. \u201cYou have a little share in the company and you can also save for the future.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even owning a small percentage of the company where one works can have a powerful impact on motivation and job performance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Do you have to give up control completely? No.</p> <p>I have a number of clients who chose to sell a portion of the businesses to their workforce while still maintaining the majority of their shares. But even owning a small percentage of the company where one works can have a powerful impact on motivation and job performance. And who knows? If things work well, the business owner always has the option of selling more stock in the future.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to completely sugarcoat employee ownership because there are some potential obstacles to consider.</p> <p>For starters, and because employee ownership arrangements are essentially benefit plans, there are tax filings and compliance requirements. The organizational structure and governance may be complicated. Each year a company must get an outside appraisal, which can be a costly exercise. And when employees leave, the company is required to buy back their shares. All those factors are considerable, but perhaps the biggest concern my clients raise is culture. Although not in all cases, when an employee owns equity they may be entitled to see more of a company\u2019s financial information and for some business owners who want to protect their privacy that gives them pause.</p> <p>So it\u2019s important to weigh the pros and cons. And to address these concerns, a number of organizations have stepped up their efforts to increase awareness and provide advice around employee ownership. Besides the NCEO mentioned above, another great resource I\u2019ve found is <a href=\"http://www.employeeownershipequals.org\">EmployeeOwnershipEquals</a>, a newly launched initiative from a handful of non-profit organizations that advises and helps establish employee ownership plans for companies of all sizes. They\u2019re doing it also not just for business owners, but for social reasons as well.</p> <p>\u201cInequality in the United States is growing, with the top 10% of individuals owning more than 90% of all business wealth,\u201d says Diane Ives of the Kendeda Fund, one of the non-profits participating on EmployeeOwnershipEquals. \u201cExpanding employee ownership can combat this problem. According to research, if 30% of all businesses were employee owned, the net wealth of the bottom half of Americans would more than quadruple and median wealth among black households would quadruple too.\u201d</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2022/may/22/syrias-barrel-bomb-experts-in-russia-to-help-with-potential-ukraine-campaign", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2022-05-22T10:59:03Z", "webTitle": "Syria\u2019s barrel bomb experts in Russia to help with potential Ukraine campaign", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/syrias-barrel-bomb-experts-in-russia-to-help-with-potential-ukraine-campaign", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/22/syrias-barrel-bomb-experts-in-russia-to-help-with-potential-ukraine-campaign", "fields": {"headline": "Syria\u2019s barrel bomb experts in Russia to help with potential Ukraine campaign", "trailText": "Over 50 specialists skilled in delivering crude explosive working with Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces, intelligence sources believe", "body": "<p>Technicians linked to the Syrian military\u2019s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/russia-using-banned-weapons-to-kill-ukrainian-civilians-pictures-suggest\">a similar campaign in the Ukraine war</a>, European officials believe.</p> <p>Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists, all with vast experience in making and delivering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/23/syria-jeopardises-us-russia-deal-with-fresh-assault-on-rebels-in-south-west\">crude explosive</a>, have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Vladimir Putin\u2019s military.</p> <p>Their arrival is understood to be one factor behind US and European <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/clear-sign-putin-is-weighing-up-use-of-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-says-biden\">warnings</a> that the Russian military may have been preparing for the use of chemical weapons in the conflict, which has entered its fourth month with little sign of slowing.</p> <p>Barrel bombs \u2013 crude explosives packed in to a drum and dropped from a helicopter \u2013 were used to devastating effect throughout the Syrian war.

Recruits are deployed under contract with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/mar/15/the-wagner-group-shadow-mission-ukraine-podcast\">Wagner Group</a>, the Russian private military organisation, which has played a leading role in hiring mercenaries to support Russia\u2019s foreign adventures.</p> <p>Wagner has been prominent in Libya and eastern Syria supporting Russia\u2019s interests.

In early 2018, its forces were engaged in a brutal battle with US and Kurdish forces in the Syrian province of Deir Azzour, in which more than 140 mercenaries were killed, mainly by US artillery.

The alleged shooter scrawled a racial epithet on the barrel of his gun and live-streamed his killing spree. He (I prefer <a href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/news/media/dont-name-mass-shooters-criminologists-study-advises-media\">not to name him</a>) was clearly participating in a long and horrible American tradition of murderous hatred toward Black people, and media coverage and commentary have rightly emphasized the long reach of anti-Black racism that motivated this killer.</p> <p>But the alleged shooter\u2019s motivations were not only anti-Black racism. He uploaded a 180-page document shortly before carrying out his attack, and even a quick perusal will show the disgusting antisemitism that he also wallows in. Pages and pages of anti-Jewish slurs \u2013 including an excerpt from Der Giftpilz, a Nazi-era children\u2019s book published by Julius Streicher of Der St\u00fcrmer infamy \u2013 fill the document. At one point, the killer writes, \u201cIf the Jews did not have connections to Judaism, then I believe that they would be able to live in White countries such as the USA. But because of the irreversible rabbinic teachings they must be removed from all European and White countries.\u201d</p> <p>The document is clearly an expression of replacement theory, a garbage conspiracy theory that believes Jewish and corporate elites aim to \u201creplace\u201d white people from their own countries through mass immigration. To explain \u201creplacement theory\u201d, media <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/16/1099034094/what-is-the-great-replacement-theory\">reports</a> immediately began <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-is-great-replacement-theory-and-how-does-it-fuel-racist-violence\">citing</a> the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when white men in starchy polo shirts carried tiki torches while screaming \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d</p> <p>The main frames of analysis for this attack, in other words, have been thoroughly American. Seen through the domestic American lens, this attack looks very much like a toxic mix of America\u2019s anti-Black racism with a virulent strain of American antisemitism. There\u2019s no doubt that this is true, but it\u2019s not the entire story. Almost completely absent from the discussion is Islamophobia, and how this kind of extreme rightwing violence is in significant part a byproduct of the war on terror and the Islamophobia it spawned.</p> <p>Consider how the Buffalo shooter acknowledges, in his document, that the person who radicalized him the most was none other than the man who, in 2019, live-streamed himself shooting and killing 51 worshipers in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. In fact, the title of the Buffalo shooter\u2019s manifesto (\u201cYou wait for a signal while your people wait for you\u201d) is a line written in the New Zealand shooter\u2019s manifesto, which itself was titled The Great Replacement.</p> <p>Moreover, the Buffalo shooter\u2019s manifesto lifts many lines verbatim or nearly so from the New Zealand shooter\u2019s manifesto, a move that is quite typical of the genre. A few examples must suffice, but in truth there are many more. Both documents adopt a question and answer format.</p> <p>New Zealand shooter\u2019s document:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why did you carry out the attack?</strong></p> <p>To most of all show the invaders that our lands will never be their lands, our homelands are our own and that, as long as a white man still lives, they will NEVER conquer our lands and they will never replace our people.</p> </blockquote> <p>Buffalo shooter\u2019s document:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why did you decide to carry out the attack?</strong></p> <p>To show to the replacers that as long as the White man lives, our land will never be theirs and they will never be safe from us.</p> </blockquote> <p>New Zealand shooter:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Did/do you personally hate muslims? </strong></p> <p>A muslim man or woman living in their homelands? No.</p> <p>A muslim man or woman choosing to invade our lands live on our soil and replace our people? Yes, I dislike them.</p> <p>The only muslim I truly hate is the convert, those from our own people that turn their backs on their heritage, turn their backs on their cultures, turn their back on their traditions and became blood traitors to their own race. These I hate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Buffalo shooter:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Did, or do you personally hate blacks?</strong></p> <p>A black man or woman living in their homelands? No.</p> <p>A black man or woman choosing to invade our lands, live on our soil, live on government support and attack and replace our people? Yes, I dislike them.</p> <p>The only people I truly hate are the converts, those from our own people that turn their backs on their heritage, turn their backs on their cultures, turn their back on their traditions and become blood traitors to their own race. They are not completely hopeless however. I believe some can come back, so it\u2019s important to welcome them when they are awoken instead of shaming and ostracizing them.</p> </blockquote> <p>New Zealand shooter:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Do you consider it a terrorist attack?</strong></p> <p>By the definition, then yes. It is a terrorist attack. But I believe it is a partisan action against an occupying force.</p> </blockquote> <p>Buffalo shooter:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Do you consider the attack an act of terrorism?</strong></p> <p>By definition yes. But I believe it is a partisan action against an occupying force.</p> </blockquote> <p>The point of this comparison should not be about plagiarism. All these far-right manifestos freely cut-and-paste texts and images from each other and from around the web. They are, as I\u2019ve written <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/breiviks-monstrous-dream-and-why-it-failed/\">elsewhere</a>, better understood as wikis of the far right, where each person contributes their literary share of hate. Such compendiums are avenues to crowd-source the energy and commitment required for mass murder.</p> <p>But by placing them side-by-side, what\u2019s both amazing and completely unsurprising to see is how easy it is to replace Muslim with Black in the logic of the far right, grimly ironic for an ideology that is so violently dead-set against \u201creplacement\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s likewise important to see the glee with which these bored and lonely individuals find heroism in fascism. (The Buffalo shooter says he started browsing 4chan in May 2020 out of extreme boredom in the early days of Covid.) They <em>want</em> to be called terrorists. They glow at being labeled racists. Dick Cheney once <a href=\"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/vicepresident/news-speeches/speeches/vp20010916.html\">stated</a> that, to win the war on terror, the United States would have to work through \u201cthe dark side\u201d and \u201cuse any means at our disposal to achieve our objectives\u201d. These shooters, in murderous delusions of grandeur, want to see themselves as the final bulwarks of an otherwise dying western civilization \u2013 doing what they have to do to save us from the invaders, just as Jack Bauer saved us from terrorist invaders weekly in Fox\u2019s drama 24. They have moved to the dark side \u2013 for us. (Though not for me, obviously.)</p> <p>As Kathleen Belew chronicles in her book <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237698\">Bring the War Home</a>, the defeat of the United States in Vietnam contributed significantly to the rise of the modern white supremacist movements in the 1970s and 1980s. Similarly, it\u2019s time we confront the fact that the (definitionally) inconclusive war on terror, which has also displaced somewhere <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2021/Costs%20of%20War_Vine%20et%20al_Displacement%20Update%20August%202021.pdf\">between 38 and 60 million people</a>, continues to fuel the rise of rightwing movements around the globe.</p> <p>We do ourselves a disservice when we see the right wing narrowly and understand the right exclusively through an American lens. Is it any wonder that the American Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) traveled to Victor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary for their conference this year? From the fringe to the mainstream, the right wing increasingly gathers strength by nurturing its international connectivity. If we want to protect ourselves from more of these shooters, we must do the same.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel To Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.

And so we\u2019ve used that policy to take unprecedented action.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Mohan added that YouTube\u2019s news content on the conflict had received more than 40m views in Ukraine alone.</p> <p>\u201cThe first and probably most paramount responsibility is making sure that people who are looking for information about this event can get accurate, high-quality, credible information on YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consumption of authoritative channels on our platform has grown significantly, of course in Ukraine, but also in countries surrounding Ukraine, Poland, and also within Russia itself.\u201d</p> <p>YouTube did not provide a breakdown of the taken-down content and channels but Mohan said much of it represented Kremlin narratives about the invasion. \u201cI don\u2019t have the specific numbers, but you can imagine a lot of it being the narratives that are coming from Russian government, or Russian actors on behalf of the Russian government,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>YouTube has an estimated 90 million users in Russia, although it no longer allows advertising on the platform in the country.

She could never have foretold that Floyd would become a household name because the world watched a video of police officer Derek Chauvin slowly choke him to death with his knee on his neck in 2020.</p> <p>The killing sparked the largest protests ever against racial injustice, prompting society to discuss racism in ways it has not done for more than a generation. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> (written by two <em>Washington Post</em> reporters) attempts to use the life and death of Floyd as a vehicle to examine the bigotry that lies at the heart of the present-day US.</p> <p>Figures that spark protests are often barely drawn in two dimensions: we have a name, an image and little else. We know Emmett Till \u2013 whose lynching in 1955 is credited with sparking the civil rights movement after his mother displayed his disfigured body in an open casket \u2013 as a 14-year-old killed for supposedly whistling at a white woman. Trayvon Martin \u2013 whose killing by George Zimmerman in 2012 ignited the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 is the teenager in a hoodie who died for going to a shop to buy Skittles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors make a valiant effort to use Floyd\u2019s story to educate society about the ills of structural racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this age of misinformation, where the victims of police killings are made out to be the problem, this humanising of Floyd is necessary. The book does not paint him as a saint but explains his flaws in the context of his experiences. Yes, he was an addict, a convict, and even made a porn movie. But these are not separate from his role as a father, friend and the backbone of his family and community. It is welcome that Floyd<strong> </strong>is no longer an anonymous Black man and you can feel the devastation of his family, friends and community in the interviews that pepper the book.</p> <p>Samuels and Olorunnipa\u2019s greatest triumph is placing Floyd\u2019s life in the context of white supremacy. Before we get to Floyd, we learn about his ancestors\u2019 struggles as tenant farmers in the period after slavery was abolished, known as \u201creconstruction\u201d. Rather than abolition marking an end to racism, we grasp how the logic of racism continued<strong>.</strong> Racist laws and segregation became the tools for keeping the Black population oppressed. Floyd\u2019s great-grandfather was stripped of the land and money he had managed to accumulate in tobacco farming, leaving the family in the poverty that was passed down through the generations.</p> <p>The authors<strong> </strong>reflect on the irony of Floyd being killed after allegedly buying cigarettes with a fake $20 bill, given his family\u2019s history with tobacco. Throughout, Floyd\u2019s life is used to discuss issues such as racial terrorism, housing segregation, mass incarceration and racism in schooling. The point is driven home that his life and death were a result of the racism built into American society. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/08/29/david-smith-death-minneapolis-police-kneeling/\">David Smith</a> was killed by Minneapolis police in 2010, in an almost identical manner to Floyd, but there was no public outcry.</p> <p>There is a way in which all the attention on Floyd\u2019s death has in some way limited the conversation: we all agree that his murder was indefensible,<strong> </strong>Derek Chauvin went to prison, minimal policing reforms occurred\u2026 and now we can move on. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> adds to this narrative by focusing on this one event and its aftermath. The lack of any global context severely limits our understanding of racism, which,<strong> </strong>as Malcolm X explained, is \u201cnot just an American problem, but a world problem\u201d.</p> <p>The focus on Floyd also follows the unfortunate pattern of highlighting the plight of Black men, reinforcing how we are drawn to the spectacle. The violence has tended to be public, from lashings on the plantation to lynchings leaving strange fruit hanging from southern trees. The oppression of Black women is more private \u2013 sexual violence, evictions and deadly institutional inequalities, such as being four times more likely to die in childbirth \u2013 and more difficult to capture on camera.</p> <p>Activist and professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw started the #SayHerName campaign to draw attention to the Black women who were far more likely to be killed by the police than their white counterparts. I couldn\u2019t read this book without thinking how Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her home by police in 2020, would have been a rich subject.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/13/fear-of-black-consciousness-by-lewis-gordon-review-why-minds-not-bodies-are-the-problem\">Fear of Black Consciousness by Lewis Gordon review \u2013 why minds, not bodies, are the problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The horrific murders in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/buffalo-shooting-supermarket-new-york\">Buffalo</a> last weekend are a reminder of how a focus on racism can cloud larger issues.

It was one of hundreds of federally run boarding schools across the US that aimed to assimilate Native American children into white society by taking them from their families, chopping their hair short, and brutally punishing them for speaking their language and practising their culture.

The US says it has transformed the remaining schools, but students like Medicine feel echoes of the old system.</p> <p>Today, signposts on the grassy grounds show reservation names and their distances from the school, reminding Medicine how far she is from home: Standing Rock, North Dakota, 1,453.9 miles. \u201cIt sucks a lot because there have been times this year that I\u2019ve wanted to go back home, and I can\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Members of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe living in Fort Yates, North Dakota, Medicine\u2019s family smudged, prayed, attended sweats and spoke Lakota.</p> <p>\u201cWe practise our way of life as our ancestors did,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Medicine lived with her aunt, Kolette Medicine, who is a teacher, in a town of fewer than 200 people where there wasn\u2019t much to do. She said alcohol and drug use were common, which Medicine and her aunt see as a direct consequence of the intergenerational trauma of boarding schools. Medicine attended an off-reservation public school where she felt it was \u201cfrowned upon to be Native\u201d, and the on-reservation high school offered little hope. \u201cI probably would have dropped out,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A friend told her about Sherman \u2013 students go on field trips to the beach and Universal Studios in Los Angeles, her friend said. The school also offered a clearer pathway to college. Medicine saw it as a chance to explore the world. She filled out an application form and called every day until she was accepted.</p> <p>Before attending, she had a conversation with her aunt and grandmother about what it meant to go to boarding school. Few Native Americans are untouched by the dark legacy of the assimilation policy, and her grandmother was no exception. Born in 1946, she attended boarding school in California, where she wore her hair short and was given a white name, Medicine recalled.</p> <p>\u201cShe never really talked about it. I knew it brought up hard feelings for her whenever I would ask,\u201d Medicine said. Her aunt said Medicine\u2019s grandmother shared fond memories of school friends, singing in a choir, and cheerleading.</p> <p>Her grandmother was the one who passed down the language and culture. She gave her granddaughter the name Wicahpi Win, meaning \u201cstar woman\u201d, referencing the belief that Lakota people come from the Milky Way.</p> <p>\u201cWe just talked about the positive, the good things it would be for Kimmi,\u201d Kolette Medicine said. \u201cWe thought she would have more opportunities there.\u201d</p> <h2>History and change</h2> <p>The US and Canada are facing a reckoning over their use of boarding schools to assimilate Indigenous children.</p> <p>A US government <a href=\"https://www.bia.gov/sites/default/files/dup/inline-files/bsi_investigative_report_may_2022_508.pdf\">report</a> released last week found at least 53 burial sites at boarding schools containing hundreds of graves, with officials expecting to discover thousands more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38b7be9fa47670333ec4bf4ffb77e34b08a3f5e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38b7be9fa47670333ec4bf4ffb77e34b08a3f5e1/0_0_3200_2030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"gravestones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sherman Indian high school\u2019s cemetery, seen last year, as a man encircles each grave with sage smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MediaNews Group/The Riverside Press-Enterprise/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32c1f66768cdc4fa3709d9dc9e0c1044604e195b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32c1f66768cdc4fa3709d9dc9e0c1044604e195b/0_0_3200_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sign says Sherman Indian school cemetery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"540\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A US government report last week found at least 53 burial sites at boarding schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MediaNews Group/The Riverside Press-Enterprise/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The report found that, from 1819 to 1969, there were 408 boarding schools running in every corner of the country. The federal government continues to operate four off-reservation boarding schools for Native American children<strong> </strong>through the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), but in 2019, the BIE\u2019s deputy assistant secretary Mark Cruz said the schools were \u201cno longer in the business of assimilation\u201d and \u201ctheir purpose was transformed to support and respect tribal self-determination and sovereignty\u201d.</p> <p>The Sherman school, which is included in the report, has a cemetery with more than 60 graves, most containing the remains of students who died of diseases, explained Jean Keller, a historian who <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Empty-Beds-Institute-1902-1922-American/dp/087013650X\">wrote a book</a> about the Sherman Institute, as the school was previously known. Several children died in accidents: \u201cOne kid was killed because he was on the playing field and they were throwing a hammer and the hammer hit him in the head. Another kid was in the bakery and the oven blew up,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The US used a twin policy of land dispossession and boarding schools to separate Native Americans from their territories and culture. It was the cheapest and safest way to gain land for white people, the report found. Congress passed laws ordering parents to send their children to the schools and authorised the interior secretary to withhold rations from those who refused. Communities hid their children, but officials sent police to chase and capture them.</p> <p>Sherman was \u201ca place of incarceration\u201d, said Clifford Trafzer, a history professor at the University of California Riverside who <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shadows-Sherman-Institute-Photographic-Magnolia/dp/1942279132\">co-authored a book</a> about the institute. Children were taught trades and sent to work on ranches as a way to integrate them into society. Today, Sherman looks very different. The Red Power movement in the 1960s and 70s saw Native Americans push for education that included their cultures and prepared students for college.</p> <p>Howard Dallas, one of 16 siblings, was sent to Sherman with his three sisters in the 60s because his mother couldn\u2019t care for them all. He said the school was \u201cinstitutionalised\u201d and taught them vocational training. \u201cYou could become a welder, painter, sheet metal worker or carpenter,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Matthew Levias Sr, another alumnus who attended in the 60s and became a star on the Sherman football team, said the school had taught him leadership. Dallas and Levias joined a student committee to push for better education and wrote a proposal to get the school accredited. \u201cIt started with the students. All the ideas came from the students,\u201d Levias said.</p> <p>The school was accredited in 1971 and renamed Sherman Indian high school, and laws followed: the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act eliminated the assimilation policy, and the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act guaranteed the right to ceremony.</p> <p>Today, the school hosts an annual powwow, and students take lessons in Native American fashion, basket weaving, native plant uses and the Navajo language. Most of the teachers and staff are Native American. Students learn a standard high school curriculum, and a Native Studies class teaches them American history, including the <a href=\"https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199579815.001.0001/acprof-9780199579815\">doctrine of discovery</a>, an international law that European settlers used to justify taking Indigenous land \u2013 and boarding schools. At cultural week in April, students wore orange shirts to honour the children who had died.</p> <p>Sherman is funded by and answers to the federal government, through the BIE. The school suffers from low student achievement that has been <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/how-washington-created-the-worst-schools-in-america-215774\">endemic in the BIE system</a> for close to a century, according to a 2018 BIE report. Children leave home for months at a time, and staff are considered \u201cin loco parentis\u201d, meaning \u201cin place of the parent\u201d. And with more than 70 tribes represented but only Navajo classes offered, most students still do not learn their own language.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"761b58556acfb2d4c8b34fcd2f9c2045b5a9a562\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/761b58556acfb2d4c8b34fcd2f9c2045b5a9a562/0_0_3200_1911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man takes photo outside school building\" width=\"1000\" height=\"597\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sherman is funded by and answers to the federal government.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MediaNews Group/The Riverside Press-Enterprise/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marsha Small, a Northern Cheyenne researcher whose work focuses on another operating off-reservation boarding school, Chemawa in Oregon, said many alumni were not fluent in their own languages. \u201cThat language ties them to the land. Their land is what their identity is,\u201d she said. \u201cMy question to those boarding schools is: are you teaching that student their language? Because if you\u2019re not, you are still committing the same type of genocide that was originated by the colonial system.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You have to live in both worlds\u2019</h2> <p>Medicine has felt homesick, but unlike in the old days, she Snapchats and calls her aunt.</p> <p>She enjoys her Native studies class and recently visited SeaWorld and Universal Studios. But she noticed that other students don\u2019t know their culture and language, and they struggle with anxiety, depression and intergenerational trauma. \u201cWe\u2019re in a Native school for Native children, and you\u2019re seeing more and more students being whitewashed, in a sense of not knowing their cultural and spiritual ways,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She explained that many students would rather blend into the non-Indigenous world than express their culture. \u201cYou kind of have to live in both worlds,\u201d she said, but some step too far into \u201cthe white man\u2019s world\u201d and don\u2019t realise how much harm it does to them spiritually. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that a lot of people are scared to embrace who they are. I\u2019m proud to be Native. I\u2019m proud to be Lakota.\u201d</p> <p>Current and former Sherman teachers said it was rare to find a student who speaks their language. Medicine speaks Lakota, a severely endangered language, according to the <a href=\"https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/2052#:~:text=Lakota%20is%20dangerously%20close%20to,of%20the%20total%20Lakota%20population.\">Endangered Languages Project</a>. She would enjoy taking a Lakota class if Sherman offered one.</p> <p>Sherry Means, from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, used to teach Lakota at Sherman but left and was not replaced. She had a positive experience at Sherman before a family matter pulled her home. \u201cToday those boarding schools actually do save a lot of Indian kids from their life of poverty,\u201d she said. But she doesn\u2019t think they have fully reformed; she believes continuing federal control leads to a less creative curriculum that doesn\u2019t allow students to immerse themselves in their languages. \u201cThe top-down management has always been in existence and really needs to change,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Medicine plans to apply to college but is considering her options. She wants to keep exploring the world.</p> <p>She sees how much boarding school has changed, but with continued government management, she doesn\u2019t believe they are truly reformed. \u201cThe only difference now is that we can wear whatever clothes we want, and we can talk to our family whenever we want. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s still institutionalised.\u201d</p> <p>As we talk on the phone, Medicine digs into her lunch: a sub, fries, Gatorade and macaroni salad. \u201cSometimes they give us Indian tacos, but I could make it better,\u201d she jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s a hit and miss whenever they try. It\u2019s never going to be as good as back at home.\u201d</p>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}]}
